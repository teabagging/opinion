You point out one example of hyperbole in the Daily Mirror piece, then dismiss it entirely? Can you not see that, although presented in tabloid-style, the author is in fact arguing that It's white males, worldwide, who are causing themselves and the rest of the planet the most problems and they run the world? Then there is your discussion of the examples of anti-progressive policies by non-white people in power: Just because, for example, the Taliban in Afghanistan and Hindu Nationalists in India rose to power chronologically after periods of British (i.e white European) colonial rule does not mean you can attribute their repressive policies as due to white men in power. That childish statement denies all agency from the non-white people who very much have their own politics, ideology and power and frankly ignores the reality of the post-colonial (and pre-colonial) history of both countries. Indeed your comment serves to emphasise the point that OP was making: that the sentiment and ideology which produces statements like white men need to give up power - they are the problem! is entirely flawed and motivated more by prejudice or end-goal reasoning (e.g. you believe that white men in power are the problem first, the contort the history to fit that worldview) than by evidence or reality.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

She's the lesser of two evils, that's all, not the best option of the many on the ballot this year but the only one who could win if picked is your best argument and she will be a terrible leader like Biden regardless as she's him again in idpol new shiny optics form.The lesser of two evils is literally all we can do until we can actually convince the vast majority of Americans that voting 3rd party is NOT a waste.  That's gonna take a lot longer than you would like, you impatient child.  It took *decades* of conditioning to get us to this point, it'll take even longer to get us out of it. Who said I'm going to do that, necessarily? We have every right to call out their BS, regardless of who we're voting for individually. Their selfishness is what landed us all here, in fact.Most of the people I've talked to in this subreddit have told me that they're either not gonna vote, or they're gonna vote for Jill Stein, both of which are selfish and stupid actions.  I would LOVE it if our government suddenly decided that they'd had enough of Netanyahu's bullshit and told him to knock it the fuck off, but that is NOT going to happen overnight. They aren't being saved, though, currently being killed- both Harris and Trump are trash.Again, there is NO overnight solution to this problem.  The absolute FASTEST solution is a violent revolution, and I can promise you that the revolutionaries will NOT win if they can't get the military, or at least a significant chunk of it, on their side.  But just as the Overton window was pushed further and further to the right over the years, we can push it back to the left.  It won't be easy, *and it won't fucking be fast,* but it can be done, and the more we push, the better Palestine's chances become.So ultimately, Americans have four options.1. Vote for President Skroob, and thereby America's last president ever\\n2. Vote for America's first woman president, and keep the experiment going\\n3. Vote for someone not either of these two (which is a waste because they won't even get CLOSE to winning, and is also one less vote that Wish.com Palpatine needs to overcome to beat Harris)\\n4. Don't vote at all (which, again, is one less vote that Trump must overcome)There's literally only one viable option that has a remote chance of prolonging the existence of Palestine, and that is Kamala Harris.But like I said, this sub can pat itself on the back for not voting for someone who isn't 100% perfect on this one fucking issue, and you can stand proud next to the *dead fucking bodies.*","title":"Carter could have codified Roe v Wade.

That mattered to people to be seen by their country as someone who could prove themselves qualified to be president and be judged by their character and expertise and not their race.

My favorite President of all-time is Reagan followed by Trump who I believe can surpass Reagan after he wins next week.

I think a lot of that stems from Marxist conceptions of class consciousness with race, gender, etc. replacing distinctions based only on class. This is couples with a notion derived from protestant christianity that the oppressed are inherently virtuous while the powerful are inherently sinful, so the marginalized groups are seen as morally virtuous and heroic while the oppresser groups are seen as inherently sinful. That is why I think you are wrong here: \\\\ I'm skeptical that anyone views straight White men as some inherently harmful category, as if these qualities create a genetic predisposition to being oppressive assholes.?as you do very much see people with self-described progressive adopting that attitude (lots of examples on reddit). The question is whether this ideology - although currently in vogue in certain spaces - is at all correct or false, helpful or damaging, or should be rejected alltogether. As OP points out the idea that e.g. straight white men, as a whole group, hold power is clearly wrong, and this emphasis on sinful oppressor and virtuous oppressed groups just leads to prejudice against the oppressor category and a flawed understanding of society at large. If you want to talk about the people in power you need to do just that, instead of lumping in everyone with certain characteristics. So the writers of these kind of articles do need to change their mindset and worldview, and deserve to be criticized for it.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

If we don't keep voting, *and voting to the left,* Palestine will die faster.  The further out we can push that, the better a chance there is of stopping the war entirely. The US was at the forefront of creating Israel (yet another genocidal colonial state) and then helping defend them from anyone that tried to undo that mistake.I don't think giving Jews a place they could call home and not be persecuted like they were under Adolf Hitler was a mistake, though I DO think that calling that place \\"Israel\\" *was* a mistake.  Religious connotations NEVER give us anything good.That said, my understanding is that it wasn't properly ratified at the UN or something, so technically the creation of Israel (in that particular location, at least) was ultimately illegal, but it's been a while since I've looked at the details, so I could be wrong about a bunch of shit. The weakening of the US and its ability to project power across the planet can only be a positive for Palestinians.Are you fucking kidding?

Stopping it would require the cooperation of the sitting president, yes, but also congress. And, backing out of an agreement like this could jeopardize the USA's other alliances...And that's all besides the fact that she's the *vice* president, not the president; if Biden's dead set on supporting Israel, there's really nothing she can do about that. Even further, many American people are supportive of Israel. Wrongly, I think, but cutting support would have lasting consequences on her political career.The Harris campaign is kind of screwed unless she walks a very fine tightrope here. So, is she supposed to give up her chance at winning the presidency, stopping Donald Trump from getting a second term and empowering the Heritage Foundation, and generally putting out the million fires we have over here, to make a promise she probably won't be able to execute on until after she's securely in power? And, if she does choose to prioritize the wellbeing of the people here in America over trying to redirect the inertia of this war machine, is that the same thing as supporting genocide? I would argue no. Trying to do something about it from where she is would almost certainly prevent her from making a positive change for anyone. It's obviously terrible what's happening in Gaza, and make no mistake, I'm not saying that it's good or correct that the United States is supporting Israel in committing genocide. But you can't make the mistake of assuming it all comes down to the freely executed will of the (*vice*) president.

Roosevelt used the authority of the revised Alien Enemies Act to issue presidential proclamations #2525 (Alien Enemies C Japanese), #2526 (Alien Enemies C German), and #2527 (Alien Enemies C Italian), to apprehend, restrain, secure, and remove Japanese, German, and Italian non-citizens.[10]Roosevelt later cited further wartime powers to issue Executive Order 9066, which interned Japanese Americans using powers unrelated to the Alien Enemies Act.Executive Order 9066 was a United States presidential executive order signed and issued during World War II by United States president Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 19, 1942. \\"This order authorized the forced removal of all persons deemed a threat to national security from the West Coast to \\"relocation centers\\" further inlandresulting in the incarceration of Japanese Americans.\\"[1] Two-thirds of the 125,000 people displaced were U.S. citizens.[2]Notably, far more Americans of Asian descent were forcibly interned than Americans of European descent, both in total and as a share of their relative populations. German and Italian Americans who were sent to internment camps during the war were sent under the provisions of Presidential Proclamation 2526 and the Alien Enemy Act, part of the Alien and Sedition Act of 1798.Trump keeps repeating that those who don't support him are the enemies from within.","title":"Trump's anti-immigration, anti-democracy rhetoric grows more menacing"},{"text":"You must have got it.","title":"What is Kamalas Platform?"},{"text":"What do you think your rhetoric of Nazis and Klansmen love Trump is doing to help bridge this divide?have to learn to get along,You're incredibly dishonest about your intentions here.

Dont trust a word hamas says especially about death count. Fuck Islamic terrorism and fuck hamas. This is war. People die. Its sad. Guess what? Its sometimes necessary. After 10/7 it was necessary. I dont trust a fucking word the hamas run health ministry in Gaza says. Israel has a better combatant to civilian death rate in Gaza even with those bullshit figures than any other urban conflict in human history. I get it, we all want a world without war and we all want peace everywhere always. You are not helping anyone or yourself by clinging to this fairy tale and you especially arent doing any favors to anyone but exploitive extremist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah when you direct all your focus onto the democratic country in the right whos fighting a gang of rapist Islamic terrorists.  Islamic extremism is a cancer to mankind. If you think life under Trump was and will be horrible and that womens rights and general freedoms were and will be trampled under him then just imagine what theyd be like under an Islamic extremist theocracy headed by the likes of Hamas or Hezbollah or Isis - theyre all the same. Everyone who criticizes Israels war in Gaza is either a biased terrorist loving anti semite or is a delusional fool who has absolutely no constructive alternative to offer. No one who criticizes the way the war has gone has ever at any point offered an alternative approach to kill a gang of murderous raping madness who are embedded in a so called civilian population. No one in history has been demanded to care for and protect an enemy population like Israel either. In WWII the allies literally carpet bombed German and Japanese cities on purpose. They targeted civilian populations on purpose. Obviously so has every other country who ever was at war in the history of mankind. None has ever been criticized to the extent Israel has. Macron is a fucking French coward and at this point he is straight up an Islamic terrorist sympathizer and supporter. He might as well walk around with a Hezbollah flag draped on his shoulders. He makes me sick. Let her talk yes. This is a democracy. But dont listen because shes wrong and shes parroting known hamas and terrorist sympathizer bullshit trying to pressure the west and America to pressure Israel into letting Islamic terrorists win. Oh btw the reason Israel relies on the US for so many weapons because they made a deal with the US long ago that instead of manufacturing their own they would buy American. If America wants to stop arming Israel then theyll make their own shit again. That hurts our economy. Israel has done more on its own to erode global Islamic terrorism in the past year than the US and the rest of the world has done since 9/11. Someone needs to take out the trash. Too many in the US are so afraid of conflict after Iraq and Afghanistan and its dangerous. There are still wars worth fighting and they need to be fought. You cant be diplomatic with people who are not interested in diplomacy. You cant appease dictators or radicals. This obsession with trying to at all costs even when detrimental to ourselves and our interests has to stop. You cant appease Putin or Iran. They only understand and respect force. Its like hitler. Idk how that lesson hasnt been learned yet. Putin was appeased for years including in 2014 by Obama when he stole crimea. Look what happened. Look where we are. He was emboldened by that. Iran attacked Israel directly for the first time ever. America was obsessed with not hitting them hard and appeasing them. Look what happened. They did it again. Is that the new normal? America is so hypocritical when it comes to armed conflict. So fucking hypocritical. If 10/7 happened in America then the country of origin would have been fubared. Absolutely fubar. A foreign terrorist group invades en mass and goes home to home raping mutilating torturing burning murdering and kidnapping men women children babies and senior citizens? US response would have been scorched fucking earth. I want world peace as much as the next person but we dont have that and the evil in this world needs to be combated and destroyed so it doesnt win. Putin and Russia is evil. Iran is evil. Hamas is evil. Hezbollah is evil. China is fucking evil too. With the shit theyre doing and have been doing they deserve and need to be fought and defeated. People who cut open pregnant women, killing them and their unborn child in the process (hamas) deserve and need to be fought and defeated. Always. Let her talk yes but dont fucking listen to her.

If anything, Id wager it is in fact a further point we could use to argue against the kind of identity essentialism I find so distasteful; someone can be anything other than a straight white man, and still bring with them all manner of cultural baggage (such as FGM) that most liberals who otherwise entirely support IDpol would find horrifying - therefore simply dismissing straight white male culture (again, to the extent such a thing even exists) will not inevitably lead to a more progressive culture later down the line.Tbh, Im not arguing that dismantling the white hegemony will lead to progressivism. I believe that there are aspects of Western society that can change from non-Western influence. Thai society has a pretty non-violent stance LGBTQ+. There might be minor discrimination, but there are generally no counter movements. People respect each others choice and dont believe that LGBTQ+ will lead to degeneracy in the country.True; but does this disprove my point about Thailands absolutist monarchy? Does it let those who enforce the laws of such a monarchy off the hook? Indeed, can we even make a significant link between the unequal treaties of the semi-colonial period, and the authoritarian laws in place today? Even if we could, does that absolve the Thai monarchy of blame? My concern with this Because colonialism argument is, not only does it often prove overly reductive (as if everything has one only one cause; when history is far more complicated than that), but it also snatches non-western people of any kind of agency, as if theyre merely puppets for the sinister white  man, the only character capable of actually doing anything. Everyone else just dances to his tune - Im sure you can see how this line of thinking can become incredibly problematic, incredibly fast.Do you truly think that Thais actually agree with the lese-majeste policies? Do you think that if they immigrated to the UK and get into power, they will enact laws that make it blasphemous to criticize the British monarchs? That said, the Thai regime certainly needed no encouragement or influence from the white man to engage in a series of nigh-genocidal wars against Vietnam over control of Cambodia in the early 19th Century, proving the neighbourhood was not all sunshine and roses before whitey arrived, and thus that non white people are entirely capable of creating their own issues, which can feed into later trouble. Indeed, some historians argue Pol Pots persecution of ethnic minorities in 1970s Cambodia may have been justified by his desire to eliminate finally the traces of settler colonialism inflicted upon the country by Thailand and Vietnam in those aforementioned wars over a century ago; does this let him off the hook, I wonder? Does it prove that Thai and Vietnamese men are just as sly and to blame as white men? Personally, Id rather avoid such thinking entirely.Im actually impressed that you know this part of Thai, Vietnamese, Cambodian history. This is something that most seasoned history nerds dont even know about. I truly believe that Southeast Asian wars are much more violent than brutal than European wars because every country engages in population replacement in attempts to boost their nations population since Southeast Asian nations back then had low populations. This can be true in certain circumstances to some degree; but I would caution against this view of history as a strictly linear cause to effect process. As Sathnam Sanghera points out in his (for my money, incredible) book Empireland - many historians now think of the field less as a domino line, and more as a cake; with different causes being baked into the mixture to different degrees, some historical causes interacting with trends that emerge much latter for entirely unrelated reasons. The Nazis in Germany, for example, arose for a whole host of reasons developing over a 20-odd year period; it is not simply a linear cause to effect of Treaty of Versailles = Third Reich. Remove or remix any of the combination of factors that lead to that fateful election in 1933, and things could have worked very differently, even if all the key dates were still in place.The root of the timeline is probably the most important factor. Changing the root will entirely change the event. Without Hitler, other fascists may have come to power in Germany. Let me try another example; some historians have put forth the (disputed!) notion that the reason the Spanish conquest of the Americas was so arguably violent, is that theyd learned this violence from the Arabs who had conquered their homeland - who in turn had learned it from the Mongols who had conquered theirs, who in turn had learned it from other Mongolian tribes, who had in turn learned it from frontier wars with the Chinese. Does  this mean the Spanish Conquistadors can claim innocence, and that in fact the Chinese are the root of all evil, rather than the white man?The problem is that the Spanish werent the most violent European powers, the British were. The Spanish fused their culture with the locals while the British kept British culture on the colonies separated from the indigenous and African slaves. This later continued under the Americans until the civil rights movement in the 1960s.And the Arabs didnt learn this violence from the Mongols as the Arab conquest of Spain was 600 years before the Mongol conquests of the world. Others say, in a similar vein, that the Spanish may have picked up anti-Black racism from their Arab overlords - does this let the Spanish involved in propagating slavery off the hook here?I think that the Spanish just learned it by themselves without the need for Arabs to teach them. If the Spanish were, it doesnt let them off the hook, but it also doesnt make the Arabs completely innocent. Overall, you are quite a fun person to debate with. I do agree with parts of your argument, but I just feel that there are some points you made that degrades non-white people while portraying that white culture has nothing to change.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

Its a rewrite of the Michael Bay Transformers movies going from Dark of the Moon to The Last Knight. Theres a lot of stuff in the movies that I personally dont understand and dont think meshes well with established lore, and so this series of rewrites aims to fix any plot holes/inconsistencies while also keeping true to the general synopsis of the films, while also adding in original elements and characters that either exist in the continuity of the rewrites, or havent been shown in live action.The first is, of course, DOTM. Largely it goes about the same as it does in the original movie, but theres a lot about it I wish to change: \\\\-Mikaela stays with Sam. Seriously, they were fucking meant for each other, and the last one had them saying I love you. In this, theyre at the stage where they plan on getting married.  \\n\\\\-Ironhide survives. Mainly this is because I think hes a cool Autobot and because nobody in the rewrite has the reaction time of a snail to not do something about Sentinel shooting him. He's injured, but alive.  \\n\\\\-The Arcee triplets also survive, retroactively rewriting ROTF. Arcee and Chromia are closer to their general appearance throughout the franchise, meaning they have legs, but Elita-One still has the motorcycle wheel thing Bay decided they should have. In the canon of the fic, its treated like having a sibling with a deformity, due to her Energon birthing pod ( those egg things in the Nemesis during ROTF when Megatron was revived ) experiencing a glitch.  \\n\\\\-The Matrix has a larger role, being where the souls and voices of the Primes guide Optimus.This is just a small part of the changes that will be made, but I plan to have all of the rewrites generally follow the plots of the rest of the movies, while also having a cohesive narrative that doesnt contradict itself so much. I know its a very nerdy thing Im doing, but Ive been in the background making this for a while, and I want to put it out there for others to see.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 27, 2024 - 9 days until election day!"},{"text":"We can do more than remember the ones who refused the jab.

At the rally, which was held at New Yorks Madison Square Garden, stand-up comedian Tony Hinchcliffe made lewd and racist comments about Latinos, Jews and Black people, all of whom are key constituencies in the election, which is just nine days away. I dont know if you guys know this, but theres literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think its called Puerto Rico, Hinchcliffe said during the rally. Hinchcliffes joke was immediately criticized by Harris campaign as it competes with Trump to win over Puerto Rican communities in Pennsylvania and other swing states. Bad Bunny, who hails from Puerto Rico and has 45.6 million followers on Instagram, responded by posting a Story to his account featuring a video of Harris criticizing Trump for his actions in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017, which both hit the island in a span of two weeks, leaving devastation in its wake. Thousands of people were killed. A 2021 report by the housing departments office of the inspector general found that the Trump administration delayed more than $20 billion in hurricane relief aid for Puerto Rico after the disaster. On his IG Story, Bad Bunny featured a video that Harris had posted to X  (formerly Twitter) earlier in the day, in which she says: There is so much at stake in this election for Puerto Rican voters and for Puerto Rico, she says in the video. And this election is not just a choice between Donald Trump and me. It is a choice between two very different visions for our nation. He added a second clip of her video, a portion of which plays three times in his Story: I will never forget what Donald Trump did, and what he did not do, when Puerto Rico needed a caring and a competent leader. He abandoned the island, tried to block aid after back-to-back devastating hurricanes and offered nothing more than paper towels and insults. The View co-host Ana Navarro applauded Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Martnez Ocasio, on X. Lopez, who is Puerto Rican and boasts 250 million Instagram followers, also posted a portion of Harris video to her IG Story along with a screenshot of Harris plan for helping Puerto Rico. Fellow Puerto Rican Martin, who has 18.6 million followers on Instagram, did the same, adding a clip of Hinchcliffe making his joke. New York Congressman Ritchie Torres also weighed in on X: As a Puerto Rican, I am tempted to call Hinchcliffe racist garbage but doing so would be an insult to garbage. When casting their ballots at the voting booth, Latinos should never forget the racism that Donald Trump seems all too willing to platform. Also during the rally, Hinchcliffe made a racist joke about a Black person in the audience, saying he had carved watermelons with the audience member. Meanwhile, Democratic organization Battleground New York released a statement Sunday night about the rally, calling the speeches a torrent of unhinged crazy, racism and xenophobia. Whether it was targeting Puerto Rico with obscene hate, continuing to claim the 2020 election was stolen, or trying to lay the groundwork to say the same in 2024, this rally was an obscene display of unvarnished bigotry for millions to see, the group said. Its time to turn the page on this era of politics thats seen abortion bans, kooky conspiracy theories mainstreamed, and an endless stream of nonsense that does nothing to solve problems for working people.","title":"Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin Show Support for Kamala Harris After Comedian Insults Puerto Rico at Trump Rally"},{"text":"God how I want that to be true.","title":"Bad Bunny Supports Kamala Harris for President, Shares Campaign Video About Puerto Rico"},{"text":"Well that's not really what I want to hear haha.

Certainly to be expected.

One failed Republican House candidate labeled Harris the antichrist.He hardly stood out.The rally began with Tony Hinchcliffe, a comedian and podcast host, assailing Puerto Rico C in the city thats home to the largest Puerto Rican population on the US mainland. About 500,000 Puerto Ricans also live in battleground Pennsylvania, where Harris campaigned on Sunday.Theres a lot going on, like, I dont know if you know this but theres literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now, he said. I think its called Puerto Rico.The line was well-received by Trump supporters who filled the historic arena in Midtown Manhattan. Trump has recently taken to calling the US a garbage can for the world when he rails against undocumented immigrants.These Latinos, they love making babies, too. Just know that they do, Hinchcliffe continued.After the rally, Trumps campaign sought to distance itself from Hinchcliffe, who like the other speakers was an invited guest, and his comments about Puerto Rico.This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign, Trump campaign spokesperson Danielle Alvarez said in a statement to CNN.But Harris campaign had already seized on the attacks on Puerto Rico, quickly clipping the video and posting it on social media channels. The vice president on Sunday visited a Puerto Rican restaurant in North Philadelphia, where she discussed her vision for the island along with plans to lower costs and create opportunity in Puerto Rican communities on the mainland.Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, whose album Un Verano Sin Ti was the most-streamed album globally in 2023, posted a video of Harris spelling out her plan for Puerto Rico to his 45 million Instagram followers shortly after Hinchcliffe left the stage.Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, whose reelection campaign depends on sizable support from the states Puerto Rican community, joined the backlash, writing of the joke on X, Its not funny and its not true. Puerto Ricans are amazing people and amazing Americans!Hinchcliffe, also on social media, addressed the furor, saying that his critics have no sense of humor.I love Puerto Rico and vacation there. I made fun of everyone  watch the whole set, he wrote.Trump  who was introduced by former first lady Melania Trump in her first speaking role at a rally this cycle  largely stuck to the script in his own remarks, including his now common assertion that his political rivals represent a traitorous enemy within.Were running against a massive, crooked, malicious leftist machine thats running the Democrat party, the former president said. They are smart and vicious, they are the enemy within, we must defeat them.Another warm-up act, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, reprised his old attacks on Harris and the idea, as he described it, of Americans celebrating her possible election.Its gonna be pretty hard to look at (the country after Harris wins) and say, you know what, Kamala Harris, she got 85 million votes because shes so impressive C as the first Samoan, Malaysian, low IQ former California prosecutor ever to be elected president, said Carlson, before exclaiming that anyone who is not impressed by Harris will be called a freak or a criminal.Later, Republican politician David Rem took the microphone to call Harris the devil while waving around a cross.She is the antichrist, Rem wailed, before saying he planned to run for mayor.Another speaker, radio host Sid Rosenberg  who once occupied a plum seat beside Don Imus on WFAN, the areas largest sports station  started off by attacking Clinton, the Democratic nominee from eight years ago.She is some sick bastard, that Hillary Clinton, huh?, he said, channeling Trumps own past remarks. What a sick son of a b*tch.Rosenberg then turned his attention to migrants now living in New York City C and his fury over the local governments attempts to feed and house them.You got homeless and veterans C Americans, Americans C sleeping on their own feces on a bench in Central Park, Rosenberg said.

These same people have the audacity to criticize the notion, \\"vote blue no matter who,\\" when in reality, it's much more accurate to say that a vast majority of Republicans are \\"voting Trump no matter what.\\"What's also frustrating about this election, and elections of the past of course, is how it's the low propensity and often uninformed Americans deciding the fate of our elections. And I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that a disproportionate amount of them will end up voting for Trump.There is an obscene amount of wealth, power and resources all going towards swaying our elections. This includes dark money groups, immensely influential \\"think tank\\" organizations, right wing power brokers, highbrow, elitist syndicates and malicious foreign interests.There's a well oiled machine keeping this race as tight as it is, and it's so effective at persuading these kinds of voters. People who tune in sporadically and start paying more attention months leading up to the election, moreso because they are being increasingly inundated with ramped up propaganda campaigns, disinformation, fearmongering content and the like across social media.Lies, misinformation, unsubstantiated rumors and conspiracy theories travel much farther and faster than the truth. The truth is not only *boring* in comparison, but these things play into voter's fears, prejudices and preconceptions, and their half baked, low informed, contrarian worldviews.So what can you do to combat this? You can vote, yes, please vote or register to vote, and convince your friends, your family, your community and your coworkers to do the same.Participating in democracy is important, but what if that democracy is fragile? What if voters aren't making politically informed decisions? What if so many of them have fallen prey to these unstoppable outside influences and interests?I don't have the answers. I don't know what we do... Maybe we deserve for our system to be broken, maybe in order for democracy to thrive, it must meet it's greatest threats? Over and over again until enough people have overcome those challenges?All I do know is that we're in need of some serious overhauling, and we might have to get there by coming face to face with these threats, close enough for people to recognize them for what they are. Or perhaps we're doomed... Perhaps there are just too many Americans willing to embrace candidates like Donald Trump. Maybe the appeal is just that demagogues like Trump embolden these people, indulge their worst impulses, vindicate them and validate their hate, their fears, their chauvinism, entitlement and victimhood, their paranoia, their phobias and delusions. And if that's the case, we truly are fucked.","title":"Michelle Obama: Some are choosing to ignore Trump's incompetence"},{"text":"What is Obamaphone? ??","title":"San Marcos police investigating flyers threatening Kamala Harris supporters"},{"text":"A lot of people who don't care at all about politics (it's surprisingly easy to do) are suddenly seeing this in their social media feeds and it's going to piss them off.

Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederation was also a Democrat. Jim Crow laws were by Democrats. Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood were formed with left-wing liberal ideas. The goal was to get rid of minorities before they were even born and through eugenics create a perfect race. Margaret Sanger, a radical leftist, even had ties with Adolf himself. They had written personal correspondence between each others. He looked at her fondly and she respected what he did.Even Woodrow Wilson, one of their favorite Dems, was highly racist and a supporter of the Klu Klux Klan. He tried to have a bill passed while Governor of New Jersey, and it included all this racist sentiment. It was turned down. Look at some of the writings that Wilson I wrote, and it's full of racist ideals. It was the Democratic Party of the US that was apologetic to the  Nazis plight during World War II. They didn't want to do anything, and they were totally fine with the extermination of the Jewish people, even creating legislation to keep them out of the US. Democrat leadership wanted nothing to do with them. It was only when we were attacked at Pearl Harbor, did their sentiment change.

VPNs sometimes must be used for jobs for security such as legitimately changing your address to that of your work location from somewhere else. So you cant just ban VPNs. If you wanted to watch porn switch your vpn to somewhere where it allows it. Aka oh you are watching porn in some random country that has no restrictions on viewer age while the USA (in your case) would. No way for you to regulate anything of what I just said as there are numerous numerous ways to circumvent this because its the internet and its extremely hard to govern it. Just look at TOR and how governable that is, it isnt really and its called the dark web for a reason as its extremely hard to track people without considerable money, time or effort. The government will not and cannot use its special hacking software (zero day exploits) to track if an underaged kid is watching porn on TOR.There is no feasible way for you or anyone else to regulate porn like you want as there are easy work around. And some VPNs are free too! They just keep logs of what you search probably. No idea you will put up will work and there are too many site that host porn. I mean instagram virtually has non-nude porn how can you regulate that? When is non-nude suggestive pictures art and when is it considered porn that is regulated under law? Does non-nude art or even nude art have age restrictions required by law when going into a museum/ exhibit? What about companies that host porn but arent based in the USA, how are you going to regulate them and say they need to do xyz to their website to satisfy your law? What happens if they just dont listen to what you want and still host porn available to everyone? There servers arent in the US so you cant just shut down the servers.TLDR: your ideas of managing porn will never work.Edit 2: its Reddit, and the internet, but I always dislike how the internet has made it so people can downvote and not talk. It creates little bubbles without ever challenging people to stop and think what would realistically happening if you were to implementing such a system.

I think some of the questions I asked above would be problems they would have to solve somehow so what are the solutions to those questions then? Do you have them because I dont. But you just downvote and dont respond, or dont even read. Nice at least respond once when you downvote. Sorry if some of this is technical jargon, but idk, if you dont know it then look it up.

I know Ive got more in common with you folks than I think. And heres what I think. Our country is about evenly split right now. Half of us are libs and half of us are Trumpers. We are mostly all Americans who have a right to be here.Neither side is going away. We are either going to have to learn to get along, or were just going to keep fighting each other. Fighting is exhausting and usually doesnt resolve any issues. Negotiating and working with people with differences is hard. I believe it pays the best dividends though. This life is a bitch. Its just as hard for us as it is for you. We all love our families and its hard when we see them suffering. Or if we suffer ourselves. You dont like being told what you cant or can do by a liberal government that you legitimately dont like. Conversely, I dont like Trump telling me what I can and cant do. &lt;- I believe this is our biggest road block thats going to take the most work. Unless your side is willing to kill or imprison over 100 million people, the dems are still going to be here making your lives miserable. And the same with you guys, unless we kill or imprison the lot of you, you and your legitimate needs are still going to be here and you will continue to demand they be met and you will make our lives miserable. Unlike a lot of libs, I have no f@#king idea of how we are going to work this out. Im a pacifist and do not believe that war solves problems. And killing each other just sounds miserable. Who wants that? I strongly believe in Israel being a necessary haven for Jews. And I understand that Hamas is a terrorist organization that embeds military sites in hospitals and schools where children, women, and the elderly are. And I do not like criminal immigrants coming into this country. But we have a job shortage, and we have traditionally been a refuge for good but suffering people. And although I believe abortion is murder, I also believe that denying women life saving health care is also murder. We have a lot to work out. But Im willing to make concessions for peace. We have such a great country with so many natural resources, why cant we fix this?I honestly do not know how we resolve this. This election isnt going to fix this.

Rather than maintain a nominally neutral public-facing profile, this pollster acted more like a cavalry brigade for Donald Trumps campaign. And the firm did so explicitly, openly, and proudly. It all went down in mid-September, at a time when the FiveThirtyEight polling averages showed the slightest of leads for Kamala Harris in North Carolina, a must-win state for Trump. Her edge was short-lived: The averages moved back to favoring Trump. And Quantus Insights, a GOP-friendly polling firm, took credit for this development. When a MAGA influencer celebrated the pro-Trump shift on X (formerly Twitter), Quantuss account responded: Youre welcome.these critics see all this as a hyper-emboldened version of what happened in 2022, when GOP polls flooded the polling averages and arguably helped make GOP Senate candidates appear stronger than they were, leading to much-vaunted predictions of a red wave. Most prominently, Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg and data analyst Tom Bonier, who were skeptical of such predictions in 2022 and ultimately proved correct, are now warning that all this is happening again.https://newrepublic.com/article/187425/gop-polls-rigging-averages-trump","title":"Kamala Harris is the right choice for our national security and our military"},{"text":"You can call it skill.

Contemporary people would have seen indentured servitude, serfdom, being forced into work by debt, as all forms of slavery and would have would not have seen anyone in these conditions as free.During the Industrial Revolution, when wage work became the main way most people made living, the idea of wage slavery as a category also came up, but definitely wasnt as universally accepted as these other formsbecause wage workers eventually get off the clock and go home.I see the Douglas quote agreeing with the idea that wage work is a form of slavery and acknowledging that that idea was already around, even if it wasnt universally accepted. Really, I think that we are superimposing certain ideas onto historical forms of slavery as a way to disqualify things that still exist today: we now say that slaves arent paid, but when we look at antiquity we see slaves commonly getting tips and some being pretty wealthy (eg Seneca the younger), or we say that slavery is permanent, but that wasnt true of people pushed into servitude by debt or indentured servants.The result of thinking bout slavery in this super narrow way, though, is that lots of people dont think of prisoners as slaves, even though the 13th amendment made its exception because the people who wrote it knew that there was no meaningful difference between prison labor and true slavery. Thats a major source of slave labor in the US that goes mostly ignored.My comments were sloppy because I was both arguing that slavery was a broad concept generally, and that wage slavery is a reasonable thing to believe inthe Douglas quote I think its a good one to show the legitimacy of the idea that the majority of do live in a very real form of slavery today, but thats a more specific idea than just arguing that slavery is defined by coercion and not by pay.","title":"CMV: The West should not be credited with ending slavery as our economies are based on it."},{"text":"I will say, theres been a noticeable difference in (visible) Trump support locally this year compared to 2020.

Its a systemic friction that is purposefully obfuscated from people who fit the mold. The obfuscation is so successful that it leads many to think the oppression is only in the grand actions of a minor few. My partner and I have been heavily considering immigrating to a nordic country that a couple of my friends have been having good experiences with for this very reason, despite the hit it would take on our finances.I think if you were a white straight couple making minimum wage instead, your overall quality of life would be dramatically worse than it is nowI grew up poor. I spent my early 20's poor. When my partner and I first started living together all we could afford every week was 2 loaves of bread, a 16 pack of american singles, and a lb of rice.Minorities that are impoverished have all the problems that every poor person has but we are saddled with the extra burden of having to navigate that systemic friction.Yes, there is always the hypothetically mortal risk of being black and regularly attracting the attention of the police if you're American, and that's a serious problem, and being gay in the public sphere in certain contexts could also hypothetically get you killed, but being dirt poor risks your life a ton of different ways too, both in the short term and in the long term.I don't mean for this to come off as an insult but I genuinely don't understand what you're trying to say with this paragraph. The average PoC and LGBT member is not generally among the higher income brackets. LGBT homelessness has been an issue all my life. I've seen and helped people over the years that got kicked out in their teens. My partner and I got lucky in that we grew up with access to computers and were able to turn that knowledge into funds. Most of our friends growing up were not lucky.I feel like focusing on class in the U.S. would not only help minorities far more than primary focus being on race or sexuality or gender, but it would also just plain help a greater number of people than focusing on those identities, plus there would almost certainly be a lessening of racial tensions if the left focused on the shared struggles of the lower class rather than often giving the impression that the government is only interested in helping poor people who fit a certain profile and the impoverished white folks can kick rocks because they're privileged.Can sympathize with the sentiment but I disagree wholeheartedly. We definitely need to rally behind the working class and reorient the governments priorities away from this 50 year failed experiment of reagonomics over towards a labor focused economy. But lets be real, changing the economic system isn't going to stop the cops from killing black men. It isn't going to stop housing discrimination, gentrification, employment discrimination, environmental racism, education inequality, etc.Systemic Racism and Class Consciousness are two separate issues that definitely have some overlaps on a venn diagram but its disingenuous to say that focusing on just class will eliminate the friction.You can't just give a targeted minority a bag of cash and poof their problems go away. Don't get me wrong a lot of problems can be solved with money, but the ones that can't be are brutal.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

Mr. Hinchcliffe, a stand-up comic, was a warm-up act for Donald J. Trump at Madison Square Garden.Credit...Hiroko Masuike/The New York TimesFormer President Donald J. Trumps rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday opened with a standup comic who called Puerto Rico an island of garbage in a set that also included derogatory remarks about Latinos generally, African Americans, Palestinians and Jews.It was a startling program for a campaign that has been trying to cut into Democrats support among Hispanic, Black, Jewish and Arab American voters in an effort to win in several key battleground states.The comic, Tony Hinchcliffe, was the warm-up act ahead of several other speakers whose remarks were laced with vulgar insults, profanity and racist comments.The crowd inside Madison Square Garden was predominantly white, with a significant number of Latinos. Many groaned at Mr. Hinchcliffes insult to Puerto Rico. Still, he told a tasteless, vulgar joke about the size of Hispanic families, mentioned watermelons as he called out a Black man in the audience and mocked Palestinians as rock-throwers and Jews as cheapskates.At roughly the same time on Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris was in Philadelphia courting Pennsylvanias sizable Puerto Rican population with a stop at a local Puerto Rican restaurant, Freddy &amp; Tonys.But in New York, Mr. Trumps rally featured a series of speakers whose remarks were far outside of longstanding political boundaries.One, Sid Rosenberg, a conservative radio host, referred to Hillary Clinton with profanity and a sexist epithet. And Grant Cardone, a businessman who spoke early in the program, referred to Ms. Harris as if she were a prostitute. Later in the program, Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host, mocked Ms. Harriss racial identity and intelligence as he jeered the idea that she could win in November.~ NYTimes","title":"Trump loyalists spew racist, vulgar attacks at Harris and Democrats at New York City rally | CNN Politics"},{"text":"Holocaust survivors HATE this can you imagine ignorant people comparing a man that legitimately cares about this country to a hateful mass murderer people that use any Hitler reference on any true American is 100% trash- Hillary is a perfect example of a ugly trash human for comparing someone to Hitler.","title":"The DNC just projected a giant \\"TRUMP PRAISED HITLER\\" projection onto Madison Square Garden"},{"text":"He said hitlers generals were very loyal, good generals.

All you're doing is saying that white people had affected their politics, and therefore, white people are completely responsible for anything bad non-white people do. As if non-white people are somehow incapable of doing any wrong. The fact that white people were involved almost anywhere means you can scapegoat them for everything. But arguing that \\"non-white people do bad things because white people affected their politics (because white people affected everybody's politics), therefore it's white people's fault\\" that's as dumb as saying \\"bad people breathe air, therefore air causes people to be bad\\".You could easily go back in history and show that lots of terrible things were being done by non-white people. The Aztecs were horrible - and that was before white people arrived in the Americas.We could both play this game - and I could say that white people historically were just responding to bad things that non-white people had done if you go far enough back in history. It then becomes a ping-pong game of shifting blame back and forth. It's not like the Muslims waging war under Mohammed were just and polite. They treated every non-Muslim like second-class citizens. The Muslims took slaves from Africa and castrated the males so they wouldn't reproduce in the middle east. That's why there are aren't black populations in the Middle East, but there is in the Americas. Hell, even today, Iran is very oppressive to minority religious groups like the Bahai. They literally DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO GET EDUCATED. They are trying to make them poor, uneducated, and powerless by stealing away any possibility of getting educated.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD\\\\_Faith\\\\_in\\\\_Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD_Faith_in_Iran)Other cases that happened without white people include plenty of cases of polynesian people being terrible to each other throughout history.

She spoke briefly before welcoming Mr. Trump to the stage.He is wagering that the attention he will receive from his rally, in the solidly blue state of New York, is worth a detour from critical battleground states, while Vice President Kamala Harris was focusing on Pennsylvania, one of the biggest swing-state prizes.","title":"Trump loyalists spew racist, vulgar attacks at Harris and Democrats at New York City rally | CNN Politics"},{"text":"People who say slay girl unironically.","title":"America Is Always Disappointing Her: Michelle Obama Trashed For Racist Last-Ditch Kamala Pitch"},{"text":"Would love to know who would think its a good idea to insult Puerto Ricans in New York fucking City.","title":"Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin Boost Kamala Harris After Trump Rally Speaker Bashes Puerto Rico as a Floating Island of Garbage"},{"text":"lol no.","title":"Kamala Harris is the right choice for our national security and our military"},{"text":"No, Nike IS fast fashion.

They don't think of Trump as a Republican, but as a populist hero who's defeating both parties. They even view FOX as part of the uniparty establishment. (A populist treating his own party as the opposition? I feel like I've heard that somewhere before...)While this conspiracy may not have a broad following, I think it explains some of the discrepancy. Remember, the voters who turned out for Trump in 2016 were never reliable voters before him, let alone reliable Republican voters. They vote for Trump, and Trump only. So when you conduct polls for a midterm (2022) by modeling it on the demographics of the prior election that Trump was in (2020), you end up with a Democrstic overperformance. This is also why I think we should be very cautious about dismissing the polling trend towards Trump these past few weeks. It's easy to point to what happened in 2022, but remember, those were generic Republicans, not Trump.\\ntl;dr there are a lot of people who vote for Trump who are not Republicans and don't otherwise vote Republican","title":"How is PA, MI, WI, NV and AZ leaning Democrat for the Senate, but they are a toss-up for president?

However, obviously races, genders, ethnicity, etc all have interests and power is not distributed equitably among them and economic disenfranchisement can arrive from racial and other reasons that are not class in nature.So its not from Marx but it is derivative of the ideas that he helped popularize but were as many would say incomplete.Also, my views on it are complicated but I do certainly dislike not the analysis but often the framing of like post modern thought since obviously groups have interests. Its just more like everything else tied to it rather than the fact based analysis but more the morality, blame and the rejection of individuality and so forth and the desire for equality from an absolute ending which is inherently fraught with danger and hazard.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

There is zero evidence he was anything but an unwitting pawn in all of this, and thats after the FBI secretly wiretapped him.Ironically the only thing I can surmise is that Trump became completely untrusting of his own intel agencies, understandably, which probably drove him closer to Putin and explains why he still chats with him, shares intel and flushes damning documents down the toilet. I think he started out as a Russian patsy and is now an asset due to how the FBI treated him. No good guys in this story.Edit: yes. Intel agencies recruit assets this way all of the time.

It's because those sweat shops are often the only alternative they have to subsistence farming, working in mines, or other dangerous, strenuous, and often much more exploitive labor.Nobody would work those jobs if they had better work available in their local community. And often working this type of job is the stepping stone to a country's development.Before everything was marked \\"made in China\\" it was \\"made in Japan\\" or \\"Made in Korea\\" - [here's nobel prize winning economist Milton Friedman discussing in the 1970s how the Japanese produce everything cheaply. It's a long speech but you only have to listen to one minute of the timestamped audio.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2oalinPCZo&amp;t=1540s) Also bonus current-time parallel for that video, it discusses putting the very same type of tariffs on Japan, for the same reasons as people want to put tariffs on China in the current day.Now we don't think of Japan and Korea now-a-days as countries that have sweatshops. But that's because they outgrew that phase, gained a middle class, and eventually became economically powerful.The same thing is happening to China. The [Chinese middle class](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-middle-class/) is growing thanks to opportunities provided by foreign companies. China was a country of sweatshops in the '90s, but is a country of power plant engineers and electric car manufacturers today. And the cycle is repeating in [Vietnam](https://tradingeconomics.com/vietnam/gdp-per-capita) and [Bangladesh](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/GDP-per-capita-in-Bangladesh-in-2013-2024-in-USD-Source-Statista-2020_fig1_347126463) and other countries that have so-called 'unethical' labor.The truth is, this labor is not unethical. It gives companies in rich countries cheap product, and gives workers in poor countries more money than they'd get otherwise. It's a win-win situation. Now obviously I nor you would want to work in those places. But that's because we have better options available to us. But if the average worker in a rural community of 1000 gets the equivalent of $1USD per hour, and I open 4 factories that pay 200 people $5 per hour, I can hire a ton of people to make a ton of product at a better rate than they'd get anywhere else and make them well-to-do within their communities.

Always has been.What's the most egregious thing in fashion before this? Fur, maybe? We can all agree fur is torture, right? Yeah that's no accident. The fashionistas at the time didn't care and they don't now.You're talking about environmentalism? Can we put a hold on that for a moment and recognize that these all come from sweat shops?Not just sewing and hard labour but full on getting cancer at a young age because they're being bathed daily in the carcinogenic waste that you insist on for your plastic clothes.That bright red shirt with shiny metallic highlights you want to buy for your girl child? That's toxic in multiple ways. It's probably made iwth heavy metals. Plastic, toxic dyes and heavy metals. I'm not exagerrating. This is super common.Can you go to your local 'Mart and spend a few minutes just breathing in all the fire retardant gross smell in the clothing aisle? We all know the stench. It's why most of you dump more dryer sheet fragrance on your clothing even after purchasing it; trying to drown out one type of pollution with another.None of us even want the fire retardant stuff in there we were never asked. It's just normal now. Accepted blindly. It's in our blood stream and in our bones but how often does anyone's shirt even catch on fire? I suppose it's disastrous if your shirt is made from plastic (polyester). The only solution to pollution is yet more pollution.The alternatives are there; have always been there and you've been ignoring them. As if there isn't some hippy store in your towns and cities that doesn't sell pure cotton and wool. It's more expensive but it is more durable and if we all invested it would get cheaper with time.Tell me where you live or any hypothetical location and i can easily search up the closest hippy store.But we won't because fashion is evil. We've all been there. Fashion is more important than life itself. From blood diamonds to buying a cybertruck in the name of showing off. Morality in fashion is super rare. The very nature of it being esoteric makes it something we tend to not think deeply about.Finally you can just search up \\"buy organic clothing\\" and find lots of options no matter where you are.Let's all take a moment to step back and realize there isn't a single celebrity you can name who cares about ethical fashion. Not a politician. Nobody. The evil that fashion represents is omnipresent. You're legitimately at the risk of being cancelled if you do this. Would you even be hired if you went in an organic suit? Maybe you can't find a proper tie made from ethical materials so can't make the dress code.  Everything you wear will be a little off colour from what they're used to. A lot of it seems drab to the unsophisticated eye.Can you work at a fast food restaurant if you want to bring in your own wool uniform and apron? Do you have to wear plastic?Can you be a runway model who refuses to wear plastic, polluted stuff? Can you name a designer who is different?I sure do enjoy Selena Gomez in 'Only Murders in the Building' but i'm a bit scared to look up how she became filthy rich because it's probably off of disposable fashion. Even i want to maintain the illusion that she, we, I am something other than a hardcore, unfeeling capitalist.Show me a diva who accomplishes everything the others do but with wool and crochet. It's not impossible it's just that we all expect that fashion is more important than life itself. As in the life of that poor sweat shop worker maybe in Bangladesh and her miserable life and what we're constantly doing to her when it could be all organic instead. All that horror just to save a few bucks, just so that we're bright shiny and neon.I yearn for a reality in which she is a farmer and a rancher instead. It's still a hard life but it's not carcinogenic toxic.This wool sweater i'm wearing right now is fantastic. Feels like i'm being hugged by a sheep, but i am getting a bit too warm in it.","title":"cmv: there is no viable ethical alternative to fast fashion brands as of right now"},{"text":"Thanks ChatGPT.","title":"Dont Cancel The Washington Post.

Then early 2023 I watched a documentary on the UFO topic. Then after some research and stumbling on the CIA paper \\"The gateway process\\" I started to study that and going down that rabbit hole. And I started doing the tapes. Then this February I experienced a \\"spiritual awakening\\". And yeah it was definitely paranormal and real. The ontological shock that came with it was somewhat intense, especially the first week. I kept just repeating stuff like \\"This is so weird, last week I believed in none of this psychic stuff\\" I couldn't get over the fact that I kept ridiculing this subject half my life, and here I was having a full blown psionic experience. The initial experience felt like pure bliss. There were times where my head was vibrating so much and it felt like my consciousness was expanding a few inches outside my skull. At one point it started to freak me out and I just asked myself \\"is this really happening?\\" And a booming loud voice inside my head, (this voice sounded so clear, like clearer than my own inner monologue) just say \\"It's really happening.\\" A week after I started to go through ego death and it gave me existential dread. I started to have a panic attack, but I didn't know at the time that it was a panic attack. I sat down and tried to calm myself down and then that voice came back, and it just said \\"You're having a panic attack, you're very sensitive to the vibrations right now but it will pass.\\" The voice carried a lot of compassion with it. A couple months later I started to meditate and that's when the psychic stuff really started to happen. The thing that made me a believer for good was that around the end of April, I got into a really deep meditation, and behind my closed eyelids, I started seeing some really vivid imagery. And I saw the sun, in every details, launch several CME towards the Earth. 2 weeks after we got hit by several CME which caused the biggest geomagnetic storm since 20 years. So logic tells me what I experienced was a premonition vision. Yeah I'm sold on the woo now. I can't deny all the experiences Ive had this year. This has been the weirdest but best year of my life.

If anything, I'd wager it is in fact a further point we could use to argue against the kind of identity essentialism I find so distasteful; someone can be anything other than a \\"straight white man\\", and still bring with them all manner of cultural baggage (such as FGM) that most liberals who otherwise entirely support IDpol would find horrifying - therefore simply dismissing \\"straight white male\\" culture (again, to the extent such a thing even exists) will not inevitably lead to a more progressive culture later down the line.\\\\The Thais were forced to sign unequal treaties with the British and be economically-subservient to them.?True; but does this disprove my point about Thailand's absolutist monarchy? Does it let those who enforce the laws of such a monarchy off the hook? Indeed, can we even make a significant link between the unequal treaties of the semi-colonial period, and the authoritarian laws in place today? Even if we could, does that absolve the Thai monarchy of blame? My concern with this \\"Because colonialism\\" argument is, not only does it often prove overly reductive (as if everything has one only one cause; when history is far more complicated than that), but it also snatches non-western people of any kind of agency, as if they're merely puppets for the sinister white  man, the only character capable of actually doing anything. Everyone else just dances to his tune - I'm sure you can see how this line of thinking can become incredibly problematic, incredibly fast.That said, the Thai regime certainly needed no encouragement or influence from the white man to engage in [a series of nigh-genocidal wars against Vietnam over control of Cambodia](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781782382140-010/html) in the early 19th Century, proving the neighbourhood was not all sunshine and roses before whitey arrived, and thus that non white people are entirely capable of creating their own issues, which can feed into later trouble. Indeed, some historians argue Pol Pot's persecution of ethnic minorities in 1970s Cambodia may have been justified by his desire to eliminate finally the traces of settler colonialism inflicted upon the country by Thailand and Vietnam in those aforementioned wars over a century ago; does this let him off the hook, I wonder? Does it prove that Thai and Vietnamese men are just as sly and \\"to blame\\" as white men? Personally, I'd rather avoid such thinking entirely.\\\\Something still leads to another as a domino effect.This can be true in certain circumstances to some degree; but I would caution against this view of history as a strictly linear \\"cause to effect\\" process. As Sathnam Sanghera points out in his (for my money, incredible) book \\"Empireland\\" - many historians now think of the field less as a domino line, and more as a cake; with different causes being baked into the mixture to different degrees, some historical causes interacting with trends that emerge much latter for entirely unrelated reasons. The Nazis in Germany, for example, arose for a whole host of reasons developing over a 20-odd year period; it is not simply a linear cause to effect of \\"Treaty of Versailles = Third Reich\\". Remove or remix any of the combination of factors that lead to that fateful election in 1933, and things could have worked very differently, even if all the key dates were still in place.Let me try another example; some historians have put forth the (disputed!) notion that the reason the Spanish conquest of the Americas was so arguably violent, is that they'd learned this violence from the Arabs who had conquered their homeland - who in turn had learned it from the Mongols who had conquered theirs, who in turn had learned it from other Mongolian tribes, who had in turn learned it from frontier wars with the Chinese. Does  this mean the Spanish Conquistadors can claim innocence, and that in fact the Chinese are the root of all evil, rather than the white man?Others say, in a similar vein, that the Spanish may have picked up anti-Black racism from their Arab overlords - does this let the Spanish involved in propagating slavery off the hook here?I would argue no; especially in the first case, which I find quite absurd myself! But it does raise a point about Hindu nationalism; yes, it may in part have some of its origins in the British colonial era - many Hindu nationalists certainly posit themselves as anti British - but many more also posit themselves against their earlier Islamic overlords (such as the Timurids, Ghaznavids and especially Mughals); do they also therefore shoulder some of the blame for Hindu nationalism? In which case, the white man cannot solely be blamed here; factors emerged and developed in ways beyond his control, as Hindu nationalists decided to react to him (and the many, MANY) other factors they perceived, in their own way.And even so; even if we do posit \\"the white man\\" as a major factor in Hindu nationalism, I'm still not sure this lets Hindu Nationalists off the hook as \\"the white man's fault and thus proof the white man is the problem\\" - any more than the fact that an American banking crisis in 1929 (which may have been one of the factors leading to the rise of the Nazis, to some degree) lets the Nazis off the hook as \\"An American financial problem\\".","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

His dad is still alive.He was slumming it in Canada in the 90s.What happened was he got lucky with the dot com bubble.

And then paypal got him rich. Think about it like whatever happened to whoever started Instagram. Facebook didn't want any competitors, so they just bought it. Which is pretty much what Paypal did with the original x.com. Businesses want to monopolize so they have an incentive to eliminate competition by simply buy it. Or you could compare it to Tom from Myspace. Tom decided to retire and do photography. Elon Musk bought a car company and a rocket company. He got 178 million from the x paypal merger. He also had a company called zip2 which got him a lot of money when they sold to compaq.Elon Musk wasn't close to the richest man in the world until stocks shot up a few years ago.

Cancel Amazon Prime | The subscription money enriching Jeff Bezos could instead be spent on the journalism crucial to preserving democracy"},{"text":" The claim that Israels actions are equivalent to indiscriminate attacks on civilians disregards the critical differences between defensive operations and outright terrorism. There is no intrinsic difference between them.Terrorism can refer to two categories of activity. One is activities carried out by a group that has been defined as a terrorist group, usually by a sovereign government. This can vary from Taliban insurgents to the uMkhonto weSizwe resistance in Aparteid South Africa. There is nothing intrinsically with such groups as it's a political designation.The other is the more broad general use definition, which is broadly the use of violence against non-combatants to achieve political or ideological aims.Neither are mutually exclusive with defensive operations. Being labelled as a terrorist does not mean people can't be aggressors against you and organisations acting defensively can still commit war crimes (the classic example being the USSR in WW2).Instead to judge countries actions, rather than trying to apply these broad labels with absolutely no critical analysis we have to look at what they are doing.That of course undermines your example completely because Israel has been killing innocent civilians en masse, collectively punishing civilians, engaging in ethnic cleansing, systematic rape, systematic torture, using civilians as human shields, continuing a decades long right to resistance, etc. It is committing a mass of the worst war crimes possible and can very reasonably be argued to be committing genocide. First, international law permits a nation to defend its citizens from active threats; Irrelevant, because it only allows actions which are themselves legal and Israel's actions go far beyond that.\\n Theres a stark difference between targeting militants embedded in civilian areas and deliberately aiming to murder civilians.Agreed, and Israel is clearly doing the latter. To equate these actions with the October 7th attackswhere civilians were systematically hunted down, killed, and kidnappedis absurd. Which actions? You have only referred to defensive actions in some vague abstract. I am talking about Israel's disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks where they kill civilians, sometimes entire families, and comparing both em to Hamas's disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks where they kill civilians. They are identical. Israel, conversely, has the right under international law to neutralize threats against its people, even if these threats hide within civilian infrastructure.  Calling this defense a war crime ignores international standards, which explicitly allow self-defense while prohibiting deliberate harm to civilians.The problem here is that Israel has spent the last year carrying out indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks on civilians, which are just as illegal regardless of whether you're the aggressor or defender. Their actions are completely legitimate. Regarding your implication that advocating for military self-defense somehow excuses all war crimes indiscriminately: its a hollow argument. You are not arguing for military self-defence, you're arguing for annexation - which is an explicit war crime.Trying to frame is as a defensive annexation is as futile as Hamas operative framing it as a defensive resistance against oppression on Oct 7th. A country defending itself is not a green light for unchecked violence. No, the unchecked violence is unchecked violence and  annexation is an explicit war crime to me. The IDF, like any military, is bound by international law, which demands proportionality and distinction in military operationsstandards Israel frequently adheres to, unlike Hamas, which explicitly disregards them by embedding its operations among civilians and aiming to maximize civilian casualties.The IDF and Hamas both frequently commit war crimes. IDF's war crimes have been documented by the UN, international human rights organisations like amnesty early international, Israeli organisations like B'Tselem, the Israeli Supreme Court and even the testimonies of Israeli soldiers themselves.Your viewpoint is inherently rooted in war crimes apologism, making excuses for a future war crime by ignoring war crimes in the present (when your side commits them). Finally, the idea that we must hold all parties to identical standards of legality is deeply flawed when one side consistently and flagrantly violates every principle of international law. Both sides do this and both sides should be held to my heart same standard. If one of them were actually acting lawfully then it would still make sense to hold them to the same standard as one of them wouldn't be committing war crimes so could be praised for their restraint. If you truly cant see the difference between targeted self-defense and terror attacks on civilians, the problem isnt international lawits a profound lack of understanding about justice and self-defense.Please tell the refugees burnt alive in their tents, patients blown up in hospitals, children sniper, prisoners systematically raped and tortured and the millions of people denied freedom for generations that it is in self-defence.","title":"CMV: Israel should recommit to a comprehensive strategy of land for peace, but pair it with an equally strategic policy of annexation for violence."},{"text":"I heard it was heavily edited.

Treating entire communities as monolithic will not solve the problems of socioeconomic and political inequality, but rather it would exacerbate it (See how the Democratic Party treats Black Americans, overwhelmingly its most loyal voter demographic). The answer is reform and change. As vague as these political buzzwords are, it is necessary to understand that the existing institutions and power structures that dominate the society we live in were built for White people by White people. This is why when you look at conservative political movements and parties in the US, UK, or other Commonwealth countries, they are overwhelmingly White. As other commenters have mentioned, many non-White communities hold conservative beliefs, particularly on social issues but they still support liberal or progressive parties en masse. They understand that the existing power structures here were not built with them in mind, and the only way for that to change is with reform of those systems. A problem a lot of my fellow Whites have when it comes to discussing equality, and I mean *real equality*, is that they often view this as a zero-sum game. They see it as for Blacks or Hispanics or South Asians to become more equal, White people must become less equal to balance things out. The reality is however, that nobody has to lose any rights, liberties, or opportunities for other people to gain access to those same things. The pie can always just be made larger so that everyone gets an equal size slice. Part of this is how we frame the conversation. OP says that some Liberals want to reduce the power of White men this is framing the issue in a negative light. By reducing something, you are taking away from it. But like I said earlier equality is not, and should not have to be, a zero-sum game.

It caused so much harm to the Mexican side, where crime sky rocketed and gave cartels a lot more soldiers which I would think Trump would be against considering his continued rhetoric about rapists and killers. I think in a sense his policy directly caused those numbers to go up ironically .","title":"Biden says Elon Musk was an 'illegal worker' when he began U.S. career"},{"text":"From this article:Average people have few ways of combatting forces bigger than them, forces such as the threat of authoritarianism, the boiling-frog encroachment on free expression, and the near-unchecked power of the ultrarich. But consumer choice is one thing they do have. And in the hours immediately after the non-endorsement was made public, Post readers pulled the lever they knew to pull, the lever they have been pulling roughly as long as newspapers have existed: They canceled their subscriptions. As Max Tani reported in Semafor, relying on accounts from anonymous sources, in the 24 hours ending Friday afternoon, about 2,000 subscribers canceled their subscriptions. (In the same article, Tani quoted a source saying that the number of canceled subscriptions was not statistically significant.) NPR, citing internal Post correspondence, reported that more than 1,600 digital subscriptions had been cancelled less than four hours after the news broke.It was a reasonable impulse. But if Bezos is indeed why the Post is no longer endorsing candidates, and if people are worried about his outsize influence on our society, they should not be canceling their newspaper subscriptions. They should be canceling their Amazon Prime subscriptions.Amazon is the biggest store in the world, the second-largest private employer in the United States, and the reason Bezos was rich enough to buy the Post in the first place. And Amazon, as I have previously reported, is powered by Prime, which in and of itself generates tremendous revenue for the company, in addition to facilitating ever more shopping. Last year, the companys revenue from its membership offerings alone came to $40.2 billion. This is roughly twice as much as the 2022 revenue of every publicly traded newspaper company in the country combined, and infinitely more than that of the Post, which in May reported that it had lost $77 million in the past year, largely as a result of declining paid readership. The United States has roughly 127 million households. Recent estimates show that U.S. consumers hold 180 million Prime subscriptions and fewer than 21 million newspaper subscriptions.Amazon Prime subscriptions pay for Amazon to growto gobble up market share, put small stores out of business, and make Bezos more powerful. Newspaper subscriptions, by the same token, pay for newspapers to grow. They pay for reporting and editing and fact-checking and the skilled labor of a vanishing class of peoplepeople dedicated to the careful work of gathering the news, verifying the accuracy of information, and endeavoring to ensure a well-informed citizenry. The people who do that work are not the ones responsible for killing the Posts endorsement. But they are the ones who are likely to be laid off, furloughed, bought out, or underpaid if company revenue dwindles as a result of subscription cancellations.These are some good points to consider. If those unhappy with Bezos' thumb on the scales of the Washington Post hit him where it hurts more: Amazon Prime subscriptions, then that might be more effective at registering their complaints and hopefully affecting a measure of change. A side benefit to this is that this is one less subscription to clutter up your monthly bills and less temptation to buy random items online.","title":"Dont Cancel The Washington Post.

I think it \\"helps\\" right wing agitators that \\"Marx\\" and \\"Communist\\" go hand-in-hand, and in right wing circles Communism = Bad.

And its justification ended after the Civil War.This seems like an unfair summary of the reason for its implementation? I don't think it was specifically to benefit Southern states, from what I recall it was primarily supported by smaller states like Connecticut?who were worried about being dominated be states with larger populations. There was obviously the three-fifths compromise that benefited slave states but that also applied to the House of Representatives, I believe in both cases those were just compromises to get the support of slave states instead of core aspects of the plan.Second, relatedly, their importance distorts national policy. For example, the vast majority of the country overwhelmingly benefits from free trade, including with China. Just compare the breadth and low cost of all the goods available to us now compared to just ten years ago, from computers to phones to HDTVs to everyday goods. Thats even with recent (temporary) inflation. But in cynically targeting this demographic, Trump proposes blowing up the national economy with 20% tariffstariffs that, in any event, will never alter the long-term shift in the economy that now makes uneducated manual workers so economically marginal.

And not the ones where the government would be strongly favorable to them in the first place, making the situation harder.But if we have every state running its own voting system and used the popular vote then there would be strong temptation for strongly partisan state government to cheat and exaggerate the extent of their parties victory.  But as it is it doesn't matter and the temptation isn't there.  All 7 of Alabama's electoral votes go to the Republicans whether they get 60 or 80% of the popular vote in the state so no reason to cheat.Of course it would be better to not add the senators to the vote count to make the system more fair.

In great part for being more recently developed and being more rational and modern. It has nothing to do with what a contingent election means in the US, though. For the president, it's a simple 1 vote for each voter system, and the person with more votes is elected (vastly more democratic than the mess that exists in the US). The House of Representatives is a proportional system that makes every vote meaningful and allows for multiple parties to exist in a healthy state. In Brazil, if the Dems get 70% of the vote in a state and the Republicans 30% of the vote, for let's say, 10 chairs, the 7 most-voted Democrats get elected alongside the 3 most-voted Republicans.

Don't talk about the 'straight white man' but about the 'dominant demographic'. That could be a straight white man in the US, but it probably is a Han Chinese man in China. Or an upper cast ethnic Indian in India. On top of that, power should be distributed meritocratically. Those with more talent(like leadership skills) and the right kind of intelligence should get more power than others, independent of skin colour. Assuming that the talent distributed is completely independent of the ethnic distribution, this should naturally lead to a convergence of the elite demographic structure to the national demographic structure.  The reason this doesn't happen is because power isn't meritocratically distributed. Patronage networks and the general importance of social connections over talent leads to a suboptimal distribution of talent over powerful positions. Indeed, this does benefit the dominant demographic generally. The question that needs to be addressed is how we can fully optimize the total talent potential of a country as a whole, without any prejudice.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

It need only be true that they are each in favour/supporting policies that benefit them personally. Being as they are mostly from a similar background and economic situation, living in similar areas, each of them individually supporting policies that benefit them personally has the effect of benefitting the entire class.Now I personally feel that the approach of \\"attacking\\" straight white men in general is not particularly effective and has some negative consequences.If a governing body (be it corporate, judicial or state) has a broader array of experiences and priorities, while they may be less cohesive, I would argue they are more likely to consider and enact progressive policies as compromises are made. I would reason this based on the fact that someone is more likely to push for changes in their own condition than push for changes in the condition of people brought to their attention.I'll take this as a small example:\\nIn a company in a usually male dominated field that I worked for, there was no provision for PPE for women specifically, and the sizing of the unisex PPE did not accomodate a woman's body comfortably. This is despite the fact that in this company there were women working in the business that needed PPE. Their grievances were raised for several years. Some of their situations were resolved on an ad hoc basis but no structural changes were made.\\nDuring those years, a few of the more experienced women moved into upper management, and when someone on the C-suite stepped down, an experienced woman was hired externally.\\nBecause these women were now in positions of power, they were able to change the system to bring in new items of PPE that were more appropriate for their form, improving the safety and general experience of the women workers.Of course, this example is one small item, but it serves my point well.In bodies that are dominated by one particular class, religion, sexuality, race or gender, there will be at best  blindspots or at worse, opposition to improving the lives of particular groups.In order for there to be greater representation in politics, it necessitates either the political class expanding or for individuals within the homogenous group to relinquish their power by either stepping aside, retiring or dying, alongside providing opportunities from people of different identities to develop and grow into those roles.:Edit to note that this isn't about removing a group from power, but about making the whole more representative, which requires diminishing the proportion of the more represented group.I would also add that it is not sufficient to make a body more representative only in colour or gender, if they still have the same background in relation to class and wealth.","title":"CMV: Certain sects of liberals believe that simply reducing the power of 'straight white men' will inevitably lead to more progressive politics all round.

She's also spent 95% of her entire campaign in the swing states because due to the short time Harris has had, the Dems are taking a hyper targeted and focused approach at the expense of perhaps allowing some slippage in \\"safe\\" blue states and some red states to get redder.The Americans who see her the most at this point are those in the swing states. She has barely appeared in most of the \\"safe\\" blue states at all.Now, it's probably disappointing that Trump is even this close because ethically, it should be obvious that \\"anyone\\" should be better than Trump, but a whole lot of Americans are not super engaged and only pay attention to what's right in front of them.If Harris wins, the realistic outcome is she wins the EC but sees some slippage in her popular vote compared to Biden. A fairly narrow win. How much slippage there is, we don't know, probably will depend on turnout.Harris' chances here really depend on if she's had enough time and done enough to convince enough swing states to pick her.This is probably the real reason why some pollsters have floated the idea of Harris losing the PV but winning the EC and why the national numbers are so close. Now, I think the pollsters are overreaching with the national polls and she will still win the PV win or lose, but by a narrower margin than Biden. What the main pollsters are picking up is she's somewhat more stable in the swing states (but not running away with them, they ARE called swing states for a reason) while likely seeing slippage in some less \\"important\\" states (Nevada for example might be the biggest example of one she can \\"lose\\" and still eke out the presidency). That's why the polls have been so tight.","title":"Kamala Harris and Donald Trump deadlocked with \\"most accurate pollster\\""},{"text":"Why would the rights of less populous states supersede of those with more?

She's still the VP under Biden and she absolutely wants his votes. But then she's also getting questioned about if she disagrees with Bidens policies on a number of items, all of which she doesn't have direct control over (VP's have very little actual power). So sure there are a lot of questions but that's incredibly difficult to answer as well.
