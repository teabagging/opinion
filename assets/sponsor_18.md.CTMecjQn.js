The US has always been interested in economic dominance in the region using Israel as a [convenient proxy to create a common enemy out of muslims](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elQGTyqx2x8&amp;t). Basically the same way JFK [originally outlined.](https://www.jfklibrary.org/asset-viewer/archives/jfkpof-135-001) The US has funded 70% of Israel's war effort lol. Not sure how much further they could even go beyond joining in on the ethnic cleansing campaign. But they were already caught with their hand in the cookie jar called IMEC which is why this all broke out to begin with.The other problem is Israel is a radical Zionist force. In 1933 the Zionist movement made a deal with literally Hittler himself to deport 53,000 Jews to Palestine. Israel was Hitlers original plan for the Jews. Early Zionist leaders in Israel were somewhat hilariously atheist. Its all a shit show more about cleansing the region of arabic people and replacing them with people of jewish heritage. Prior to October 7th Israeli settlers launched on average 5 terror attacks in Palestine and afterwards upped it to an average of 7. The IDF and IOF really stepped it up launching hundreds on a near daily basis.Id start [here](https://youtu.be/e9To_P8gX9c?si=Np0ROtT-hTsx3grl) with that one. But Israel has a long history of radicalism and terror starting with the Nakba and Lavon affair. Which is rarely talked about but Israel actually planned on launching a terror attack on Americans and Brits in Egypt and blaming \\"radical Islam\\". This dispute, tactic, and narrative is far older than people seem willing to admit.The US has to keep distance to maintain its narrative and keep to its economic and religious guns on the matter. If we were to get directly involved it would be Iraq all over again with public sentiment turning hard and then it becomes a massive game of back peddling and apologetics. Its really not Americas job to enforce regional order. It does so purely out of economic interest and direct involvement would basically be an admission of that. Basically this whole narrative in itself has finally backed itself into a corner. Beyond that the US stepping in directly would mean complete disaster. The entire region would turn on Israel and it would be an absolute shit show. The other side of this is thats the exact thing the muslim world has been fearing for decades now. If it were to happen the US would just affirm that narrative and again. Iraq all over again. Foreign fighters pouring in supported by everyone from the Saudis, to Syrians, to Iran.

As it is right now, it is ridiculous for reasons you pointed out.  Now this could be blunted by increasing the numbers of votes in the college, which congress can do.Now if we are talking about the concept of the electoral college, I actually very much support it.  And it is an unpopular opinion on here.   And the reason I support it is because I think the president of the US should not be selected by a popular vote.  I think there needs to be a buffer between the presidency and the people.  I think electors, those people that make up the electoral college, should be who the people select and vote for directly.  These people should be well respected men and women of their communities with a high level of knowledge in things like political science, economics, history, science, philosophy, and law.  They will run on what type of changes they'd like to see in Washington.  And then these people will get together and debate over who the executive.  This accomplishes two things.  It removes the possibility of a charlatan or demagogue from seducing the masses with charisma.  And it will greatly limit the possibility of a political extremist from being elected if all electors get an equal say in who is selected.  So in 2016, it's likely a conservative president may have been selected.  But it wouldn't have been Trump.  It would have been McCain or Romney or someone like that.  Do you think it is going to happen in your lifetime?Probably not.  The most obvious reason is that it requires a constitutional amendment, which has an incredibly high bar to meet.  You need 3/4 of the states to ratify it.  It's almost impossible to get that much support for anything. The other reason is because it will almost always favor someone.  It will likely favor the Republicans going forward as the educated population continues to shift to the South and to the Coasts.  So they won't want to get rid of it.  The only exception is if Texas every actually does flip blue over the next 20 years or so.  If that happens, Texas and California will both be guaranteed blue and will give the Democrats an almost insurmountable advantage.  But here's the thing.  If that ever happens, then I can't imagine the blue states wanting to get rid of that advantage, either.","title":"Daily Discussion Hub for November 1, 2024"},{"text":"my comment isnt ridicilous but i dont expect you to understand that level of argument with your IQ.","title":"Why do Republicans always say \\"my body, my choice\\" for the corona vaccine, but when it comes to womens righs they try to coerce and force them to endure childbirth which can literally kill you.People have the free will to choose whether or not they want to inject a vaccine or have deadly childbirth."},{"text":"I think most people would have preferred not to have been [gaslit](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/01/joe-biden-stutter-profile/602401/) about Biden's mental decline, which was [obvious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GGuyk8xyiI) when he took office, and [irrefutable more than two years ago](https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-cheat-sheet-shows-instruction-074352962.html).

Typically theres a central theme like good vs evil, old vs new, dictator vs Everyman, some sort of competitive spin on the storyline to keep the public engaged. The masses need to be really plugged in and engaged because these elections are incredibly important to the elite, they provide the masses with the illusion that they choose their own leaders, and they maintain an eternal divide amongst us. A series of scripted events and controversies/scandals leading up to the election keep you emotionally engaged. The Trump trials, Bidens old man schtick, the garbage truck bit, the assassination attempt, these are all fun little twists to keep us all emotionally invested in the show. Then, the predetermined winner emerges victorious, and the narrative for the next election begins. Its like a new world order relay race, and each election is a complete cycle around the track, handing the baton off to the next puppet. The cycle can only be broken when the people realize its actually all a scripted WWe style kayfabe production, and then we can unite against them.This past decade of the electoral reality show, they turned up the heat and raised the stakes, introducing new and controversial characters to stir up tension among the public, so as to usher in the next phase of their world government project.","title":"Stepping out of the matrix is about removing yourself from the tribal left Vs right paradigm.

Random numbers I found in some random poll here but bare with me here...- Let's say Harris has 55% of women, Trump has 54% of men, and that that exact margin carries over to early voting with no other considerations involved and no third parties or blank ballots.\\n- Let's take Georgia which presently has 4,015,699 votes cast, 56% of which are women. That'd be about 2,248,791 women and 1,766,908 men.\\n- Georgia's turnout in 2020 was 4,999,960 and 44% of that was men.\\n- That would put Harris ahead by 65,856 votes right now.To circumvent that, Trump would need a big enough Election Day turnout to close that gap, while also accounting for the facts that 1), early voting very likely skews further left than these raw numbers are suggesting, 2), youth turnout is higher on Election Day and is already pretty high in Georgia as it is meaning that a block that's going to be harder against him than the norm is likely going to be showing up in numbers, 3), for every 100 men that turnout Harris is going to take 46 of them and for every 100 women he will only get 45 of them, and 4), he has to overcome the tendency for women to vote in much great numbers than men not just in early voting but in the final tallies.All of this is to say that Trump *could* win Georgia, but he would need to bank on having a much higher turnout than in 2020 and need a record high turnout of men, a complete collapse of women turning out on Election Day, or a severe polling error to do it.","title":"Daily Discussion Hub for November 1, 2024"},{"text":"His bedtime is earlier now than four years ago.

I can give some context: grew up poor, currently well off, historically libertarian before it got taken over by neckbeards, anti-populism, anti-tariffs, no real feelings on abortion but marginally pro-choice, family motivated, with my daughter growing up very concerned about a topic we can't discuss on this sub. I think Trump is an absolute narcissist and likely worst person ever to serve as president, but I note that his foreign policy handled Syria/NK/Russia better than Ds, and he was absolutely right in coming after NATO for ignoring Russia and freeloading. For Harris, I think Ds badly mishandled covid in ways that were truly authoritarian, but rather than own that they doubled down on an insidious anti-science narrative. I also feel a bit personally attacked by all the anti-rich stuff because there's a world of difference in someone making $400k and someone making billions, and the eat the rich crowd seems to lump everyone together. I was good with Hillary because the hedge fund tech elites all supported her, and it was clear she was pandering for votes on the anti elite stuff and not sincere about it. For reasons we can't discuss on this sub I'm very torn. If I truly thought Trump were the end of democracy, I'd be open to voting D again, but it does seem like hysteria to me--the same people who say an innocent misgendering or slightly outdated racial reference is an act of violence are tough to take seriously when discussing things like 1/6.Edit: I gave context elsewhere, but I voted Romney 12, Hillary 16, 3P 20.

So I'm also going to reply in a serious manner, no silly jokes this time. I'm also going to assume you're a woman by the way you're typing and your avatar, it matters for the point I have been making in my posts.I assumed you were talking about my internet statement, rather than my initial post. That's why I replied with the masochism question.Now to your actual post:I don't like colonizers and politically oppressive countries (read USA and EUROPE.) and since I DON'T LIKE IT, I don't go to those places, so I'm not everyone (after all, everyone is a lot of people).?I don't like it either. And may I remind you that is a mainstream narrative. There is nothing grassroots about this sentiment when the Mainstream Media has been promoting exactly that for the past decade orso.The past 2 years, we've had student protests across pretty much every university and college across the West. \\"Free Palestine\\" is not some obscure sentiment, it's being blasted in our faces on a daily basis...I also believe that you, especially as a woman, aren't fully aware of what \\"oppressive\\" truly means. I make the distinction in gender because from all the stuff I've seen on the \\"free palestine\\" student protests, the majority of protesters seem to be women.And there's a deep sense of irony in that a fair part of these cultures they're trying to defend, would oppress them in a heartbeat in return, solely because they're women.I don't think you, and these other protesters, fully grasp these \\"oppressed\\" cultures (Islam in particular) think of you as a \\"lower class human\\" in terms of intellectual power. Women don't get to vote in Islam countries, and if they do, THAT is the result of the West's colonisation...I wanted to say that what people are now discovering about their own history, we have already felt in our skin for years, but we are \\"silenced\\".?I would argue almost the opposite, all of our histories are muddied, we don't know shit about the actual truth. Instead, TPTB are pushing certain groups of people towards certain ideologies from behind the scenes.What you call: \\"Discovering our own history\\", I see it as \\"going along with a mainstream narrative TPTB are carefully crafting\\".Again, all of this stuff (both the free palestine, aswell as gender ideology) is mainstream as fuck. It's what the powers of  this world want you to believe...?3rd my use of Reddit is quite controversial.Why? I don't understand this statement? Why is u using Reddit controversial? If anything, given the topic of discussion, this reads like: \\"I'm a woman in a muslim country, and I'm not allowed to go on the internet\\".post about people understanding that they're not the \\"good guysI agree with you on that though. I even stressed it in my first post. We (the West) are NOT the good guys. But neither are the Palestinians, any African tribe/country/cultures, nor the Romans, Greeks, etc...In the Israel vs Palestine conflict: both sides are bad, their cultural hate for eachother has grown so deep, neither of these sides can be concidered a \\"bastion of good\\".I'm the one trying to push on the brake in your runaway ideology, because I know this type of ideology leads to extremism. As soon as you paint one side as \\"ideologically good\\", and the other one as \\"ideologically bad\\", bad things start happening.And lastly I would like to again stress a deep irony in this whole debate:Modern technology is a direct result of the West's technological and cultural advancements. If it weren't for Europe, we wouldn't have electricity, combustion engines, electronics, the internet, etc...Yet when you look at the third world, they're enamored by this technology, just like we are. They all have phones, cars, they all use the internet, and I'm fairly convinced they wouldn't want this technology taken away.So it seems kind of hypcritical when they start to point the finger at the West shouting \\"Evil', whilst at the same time consuming all the fruits that resulted from that 'evil West'.","title":"Have we always been the bad guys?!"},{"text":"Lets make it, Democrats are in the strongest position: **vote blue down the line**.","title":"Democrats are in a stronger position\\": Election forecasters give Dems an edge in swing House races"},{"text":"Bezos learned an important lesson: you can't buy your way out of the Streisand Effect.

Tell me, was it justified of the US and the French to stop Sadam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait or not? Who in the first Iraq war declared war over oil? It definitely wasn't the west.","title":"CMV: The US Middle-East Policy, especially under Biden and Obama, while good intentioned, is terrible and is driving the region into chaos and strengthening America's enemies and radical forces."},{"text":"What if I told you there are actually American Trump supporters on Reddit?","title":"Daily Discussion Hub for November 1, 2024"},{"text":"Didnt Trump dodge the draft?","title":"Democrats spent 25 years saying that Dick Cheney's kids should have to go fight in a war and all it took was Donald Trump agreeing with them to change their minds."},{"text":"The biggest destabilising force in the region is the USA.

Biden had some pretty solid reasoning on paper. When he worked for the DAG under Clinton, he was SUPER involved with handling all the right-wing domestic terrorism at the time: Unabomber, Atlanta Olympics but especially the OKC bombing. He flew down like the next day and personally handled the early investigation and a lot of the Timothy McVeigh trial. He's still a pretty big deal here. And his thing was always about making it clear that domestic terrorists were one of the biggest threats to the country but that by dealing with them with the justice system, we overcome crisis. To me, it made total sense why Biden would pick him. Hindsight just shows he has no fucking idea what to do when about 10% of the country are little Timothy McVeighs and another 40% are cheering them on.

You may have a few awful ones (like any 20th century Pius or the German and Polish reactionaries) but when you have a left-leaning Pope (especially one not divisive like John XXIII) the church tends to move left and so do most Catholics out of a sort of binding with the Church itself.In the other churches, there is no central figure so extremist idiots have an easier time finding like minded idiots and organizing into a new idiotic sect or branch of a mainstream religion.*I mean, technically all major branches (Sunni, Shia and Ibadi if you want to add them, although their theology is funky) recognize the Caliph as the central religious figure. Issue is, there hasn't been an universally recognize Caliph since idk, Ali?

It's about feelings and nothing else.If voting for Kamala Harris makes you feel nice because it lets you pretend you're stopping fascism or protecting women and minorities or helping to secure a ceasefire in Gaza or whatever, then go right ahead. That's what your vote is there for.If voting for Donald Trump makes you feel nice because it lets you pretend you're sticking it to the establishment or punishing the Democrats for their misdeeds or ending the wars or whatever, then by all means do so. This whole spectacle is exclusively about feelings.If voting for a third party makes you feel nice because it lets you pretend there might be some answer in electoral politics or that the empire will ever allow anyone who truly opposes the abuses of capitalism, militarism and imperialism anywhere near power, then get in there and cast that vote. Whatever makes your feely bits feel nice.Just don't make the mistake of thinking you're doing anything other than sucking on an emotional pacifier, because you're not.No matter how you vote, Democrats will continue to win approximately half the time, and Republicans will win the other half.No matter how you vote, the ever-expanding abuses of capitalism and plutocracy will continue making life worse for ordinary Americans.No matter how you vote, the US war machine will continue inflicting nightmarish mass military violence on people in other countries in order to maintain its globe-spanning empire.No matter how you vote, the profit-driven systems which rule our world will continue exterminating our biosphere at an alarmingly rapid rate.No matter how you vote, the empire's looming confrontations with Russia and China guarantee more world-threatening nuclear brinkmanship in the near future.No matter how you vote, people in the global south will continue to be robbed and exploited to give the western citizenry of the imperial core enough cheap stuff to keep them pacified and compliant.No matter how you vote, the US will continue using starvation sanctions, blockades and economic warfare to bully weaker nations into obedience.Your rulers will never give you the tools to end any of these abuses, because too much power rides on their continuation. They will only give you the tools to mollify your own frustrations and placate your discontentment by giving you a phony ritual to participate in every four years that lets you feel some degree of control.You're never voting your way out of this. The oligarchs and empire managers who rule you are never going to let you overthrow them by ticking a box. These sociopaths are never going to give their power to you voluntarily out of the kindness of their hearts.Their rule will end when the project of the US empire ends  either because of outside forces beyond its control, because of inside forces beyond its control, or some combination of these two factors. It will not come about because of how anyone voted in any November. It will only happen because it was forced to happen.You can help force this to happen by working to foment a revolutionary zeitgeist within your country. You can do this by helping to wake up as many of your countrymen as possible to the fact that their government and media are lying to them constantly, that everything they've been taught about their nation and their world is a lie, and that a better world is possible. Lies and propaganda play an enormous role in holding the imperial power structure together, so the most effective way to help bring it down is by spreading truth and awareness. Show people how they're being lied to, abused and stolen from. Teach them the truth about the wars, about their government, about their media, about their nation, about the people their government has designated as enemies, and about the abusive systems they all live under.That's real action. That kind of work matters. Your vote doesn't matter beyond its ability to help you feel a certain way. So do whatever you need to do to feel how you want to feel on election day, and then go do some real work.","title":"If voting Kamala lets you pretend you're stopping fascism, protecting women &amp; minorities, helping Gaza etc, then go for it.

The problem is that you need to be a charismatic celebrity in order to run for president in the US. People almost seem to care more about your personality than they do policies. Primarily, of course, it is whether there is a D or R next to the person's name. We all know that Trump won in 2016 because he ran as a Republican. He wouldn't have won with that populist appeal without the party backing his broke ass. Here in the US though, I guess my point is Trump started his campaign in 2021 in order to garner support to avoid prison before November 5th. So Harris being a VP, nobody knows her because of her invisible position, can't really affect policy, but has to compete with someone who for 9 years ran as a very popular candidate to many Americans compared to her \\"unknownness.\\" She made odd statements in 2019 as one of the most left-leaning candidates, so those came back to haunt her in this campaign, despite running as a neocon.It's entirely enough time, the US's 2 year long media circus is only there because there's so much corruption and so much money to be grifted at every level, from lobbyists to media.I agree with this 100%. Keep real and raw talent from running, use the corporate machine to turn the gears of shareholder-driven markets, and then make people pretend they have a chance to impact change.All the while we shall grow the wealth of us while they can figure out how to feed their children with lead in their pipes.?I'd argue that coming on 3 months before the election is actually a significant advantage.I hadn't thought of this. Smashing.But with the threat of Donald Trump and January 6th, I still believe the same people would have come out for a younger major opponent who has strong characteristics and attributes to challenge him. I don't think they would have for Biden since he was polling so terribly. Now, I think his polls may have improved later on, but would they be higher now? I don't think so. It has been so difficult to watch him struggle with his visible decline from even being himself in his early 70s. I want VP Biden back. That dude was the shit.On the flipside, we get a kickass Kamala Harris that Trump is terrified of because she is everything he hates; she's black, intelligent, gorgeous, and powerfully confident.","title":"Theres no other way to put it.

I wasn't particularly impressed by her in 2020 and was more compelled by Bernie Sanders and his progressive movement. But she is what we needed in this moment. We needed someone energetic that we could rally behind. And in this election, Kamala Harris has finally found her lane.Before Joe Biden dropped out, I was completely checked out of politics. The last time I was paying attention to politics was after the 2020 election with the Georgia Senate races and Jan 6. I still have never watched the last Biden-Trump debate and I never will. But the second I heard that she entered the race, it was a jolt of energy I didn't know I needed.?The day after Biden dropped out, I made my first donation to the Harris campaign. I knew we were onto something when there were all the \\"____ for Harris\\" Zoom calls happening.Some establishment Dems were floating an open primary, but it was obvious to me that it would be a complete disaster if that were to happen. Nobody else had access to the war chest except her, Biden had already endorsed her, and more time would be wasted with in-fighting.?I also remember when the MSM and pundits were saying how the enthusiasm for her was a \\"honeymoon period\\" and a \\"sugar rush\\". I also knew this was absolute bullshit. Too many people were absolutely sick of Trump, but couldn't bring themselves to vote for Biden. With Harris in the race, the \\"double haters\\" basically evaporated.Before the VP pick was announced, I was 90% bought in. But I was also nervous that she would pick Shapiro. A lot of people felt she should pick Shapiro because it might help her in PA. However, I felt that Shapiro had a fair amount of baggage, was too similar in background to Kamala, and was not as effective a messenger as Walz. I initially liked Beshear, but when I saw Walz speak, I knew he was the one that she needed in her campaign. He had the experience passing progressive legislation in MN, had various experiences in the public sector, and provided a contrast to Kamala that could reach different groups of people. I would've been happy with either Walz or Beshear, but Walz just took the edge out for me. When she picked Walz, I felt like I could trust her to make the right decision and was at 100%.?Kamala has played her cards right at every turn. From entering the race, to the veepstakes, the debate, and now the media blitz, she has stuck to her guns and inspired a large grassroots movement with the broadest coalition seen in modern politics. I think it will pay off big.?","title":"Kamala Harris has met the moment. The vice president entered the race to a chorus of doubters.

However, starting in the early modern era, people started to develop techniques for bypassing all the cognitive biases that kept us stuck, applied these techniques in a million different ways and now we live in an age of miracles. Science works. Your faith has no demonstrable advantage over that of any other superstitious person, now, or at any point in history, but you are surrounded by evidence of effective techniques for interrogating reality. Use those, and have an open mind about the fallibility of humans.","title":"How can you tell if someone is a demon/evil?"},{"text":"Hes a right wing election dude","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"wonder what the cons are doing","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Rigged.

It depends, was his reply. That so many Americans distrust their voting system is mostly down to the former president. In the nearly 250 years since the US declaration of independence, the republics most precious quality has been its peaceful transfer of power. Trumps 2024 campaign is based explicitly on his repudiation of Joe Bidens 2020 victory. In his mind, the verdict on that stolen election will be delivered on Tuesday.\\nIn case there was any doubt, Trump has vowed that his first act as president would be to pardon the patriots jailed for the January 6 assault he incited on the Capitol. He reminds voters at every rally that he plans to punish those he blames for his 2020 defeat.\\nHis opponent Kamala Harris this week compared the hit list with which Trump would enter office with her own to do list. Harris is far from a perfect candidate. Since entering the contest late after President Joe Bidens withdrawal, she has struggled to define herself in her own terms. In a race where the economy leads voter concerns, her remedies seem at best half-baked. But Americans need not like what is on Harriss to-do list to see that this is no apple-to-apple comparison. This is an election in which one candidate accepts the US constitutional order. The other wants to overturn it.\\nAn astonishingly large number of Americans are nevertheless unmoved, by Trumps attack on democratic norms. But there are also strong conventional reasons to question the risks of a new Trump presidency. These include his radical plans for the US and international economy, his impact on global stability and his disregard for the rule of law both at home and abroad.\\nTrumps economic programme amounts to a rejection of Americas postwar global role. He would slap 20 per cent tariffs on all imports and at least 60 per cent on goods from China. Contrary to what Trump asserts, tariffs are not a tax on foreign companies. Their cost would largely be borne by the US consumer through higher prices. Launching a global trade war would trigger retaliation by Americas friends and foes alike. The IMF reckons such a shift would lop a percentage point off next years US growth and cut global expansion by a quarter. The price of escalating trade barriers would only get steeper in 2026.\\nTrump also wants to curb the US Federal Reserves independence and people around him suggest he would replace its chair Jay Powell a year before his term ends. There is no near-term rival to the US dollar as the worlds reserve currency  though there is rising demand for an alternative, as last weeks Russia-hosted Brics summit conveyed. Politicising the Fed, vandalising what remains of global trade rules and expelling millions of undocumented migrants are the kind of game-changers that could trigger a rapid shift from the dollar.\\nLike good health, the upsides to having the reserve currency would be appreciated only when they are gone. Prospects for blue collar America would also be grim. Rising inflation leads to higher interest rates and lower growth. There would be no middle class boom in Trump 2.0. His wealthiest donors should also be clear eyed about any bargains they have struck. The short-term upside to lower capital gains tax and preferential regulatory treatment must be weighed against the cost of radical uncertainty. They could no longer take for granted the system that made them rich.\\nMuch the same benefits apply to Americas network of alliances. The destabilising effects of the US turning against the global order it created would be dynamic. Trump is hostile to Nato and friendly to Russias Vladimir Putin. His consistent admiration for the Kremlin strongman bodes badly for Ukraine, which Trump has made clear he will push into a lopsided settlement with Moscow.\\nThe Trump effect on China is less predictable. He would be as likely to strike a deal with Xi Jinping as to target full US-China decoupling. The only given about Trumps approach to the Indo-Pacific is his allergy to alliances. Countries such as Japan, South Korea and Australia would be forced to hedge against the withdrawal of the US security umbrella. Nations of all sizes could also abandon hope of further US involvement in collective action against global warming. America First is also America Alone. The autocrats alliance of the aggrieved would rush to fill any vacuum left by a receding US. The world would be much less safe for democracy.\\nIn contrast to the upheavals promised by Trump, Harris represents business as usual. Her comparatively traditional platform may appear unexciting, but it has several notable merits. Her advocacy for legislation that would enshrine reproductive rights nationwide would guarantee women the freedom to make decisions about their own bodies. The non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the Harris programme would raise the ballooning US federal debt by only half that of Trumps. The switch to renewable energy, a central plank of her agenda, would be a service to America and the world.\\nPeople also tend to undervalue stability. Less important than the detail of Harriss programme is what she stands for implicitly. Where Trump threatens a perilous rupture, Harris represents continuity with the values of liberal democracy and free and open trade  the bedrock of prosperity for America and its partners. The US electorate is on the cusp of a decision that could mark the country, and the world, for decades. There is still time to pause, take a breath and think through the consequences.","title":"Financial Times endorses Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Just imagine if she manages to flip your state, A real slap for GOP.","title":"'Convicted felon, slumlord, predator': Michelle Obama hits out at Trump"},{"text":"[Detect Evil and Good](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-evil-and-good) is a staple and should always be usable by someone in your party.","title":"How can you tell if someone is a demon/evil?"},{"text":"You can usually tell by their vibe.","title":"How can you tell if someone is a demon/evil?"},{"text":"No. They dont.","title":"How can you tell if someone is a demon/evil?"},{"text":"Okay so that's an interesting question, because full disclosure, I worked as a reporter (for local media outlets in Atlantic Canada) for 7.5 years. So this is a topic near and dear to my heart.The influence and impact of the way America functions politically, and via their media is a HUGE issue and one that I don't know how we properly address.One of the major problems is that most Canadians aren't particularly interested in politics, especially provincial and municipal politics. I used to cover municipal council meetings, and the absolute wasteland of people not paying attention, or not showing up, and councillors making huge decisions essentially without public knowledge or input was shocking.Now that's just one facet of the problem. The other is that over the last two decades we have seen a devastation of local media outlets, so whatever local coverage used to exist has now been taken out behind the woodshed and whacked, or has been stripped to the bare bones. Thus, even for people who DID care about local politics rather than breathlessly following federal politics, the level of service from their local outlet is lousy because the job pays poorly, is under resourced, and cannot do a whole lot of worthwhile journalism.As a result, there is more reliance on wire services (like Canadian Press), and that tends to be news that functions in a whole lot of markets, so that way you get more federal political news. In addition, for the reporters who do remain in local outlets, federal politics is an 'easy' way to generate news content.So if we want to avoid the wall to wall style coverage of national politics, we need to re-invest heavily into local and provincial/regional news. But that's not on the cards right now.There are many things in Canadian politics I do not want to see follow the American path, and this is definitely one of them.","title":"Kamala Harris has met the moment.

Funded by President Bidens Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the selected projects will advance the adoption of cleaner, more cost-effective technologies to reduce pollution, improve air quality, create good-paying jobs, and slash the Federal Governments carbon footprint. Todays announcement represents the second and final installment of the $250 million Assisting Federal Facilities with Energy Conservation Technologies (AFFECT) grant program, which will help the Federal Government achieve President Bidens goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from all Federal buildings by 2045. Todays AFFECT announcement will be bolstered by leveraging nearly $1.6 billion in private capital and Federal funds, corresponding to a total investment of $13.50 for every Federal dollar spentmaximizing value for taxpayers while also helping tackle the climate crisis.  \\n...  \\nManaged by DOEs Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP), the AFFECT projects will support the transition to net-zero emissions Federal buildings by implementing clean energy technologies such as battery energy storage systems, microgrids, and building automation systems and integrating renewable energy through solar photovoltaics, wind, and geothermal. These upgrades are essential for enhancing energy efficiency and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. These projects support achievement of the Federal sustainability goals established in Executive Order 14057 and the Federal Building Performance Standard. Selected projects include:* Creativity and resourcefulness combine with underutilized technologies to meet Federal and agency goals: A Federal building and courthouse in Montana will repurpose abandoned mining caves groundwater for a geothermal heating and cooling system to replace existing gas boilers; a DOE national laboratory in California will expand its microgrid solution to 9.4 megawatts of solar PV capacity and boost battery energy storage to 2,000 kilowatt-hours; and a Coast Guard yard in Maryland will slash on-site fossil fuel usage with a comprehensive ground-source heat pump solution. \\n* Complete elimination of on-site fossil fuel in five Federal projects: Through comprehensive retrofitting and electrification efforts, these projects will eliminate 100% of their direct on-site (Scope 1) emissions, demonstrating an important step toward decarbonization and advancing progress toward more sustainable Federal infrastructure. \\n* Achieving net-zero water at a military fort in South Texas: Facing chronic water scarcity, this project will implement advanced water conservation technologies to create a self-sustaining water system, ensuring long-term resilience and operational continuity while addressing critical resource challenges in the region.The collective 67 projects announced today will deliver substantial benefits: * Reduce greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to removing 19,370 gas-powered vehicles from the road annually (81,388 Mt CO2e/year). \\n* Save taxpayers $41.7 million annually in energy and water costs. \\n* Achieve energy savings equivalent to powering 35,701 homes annually (883,525 MMBtu/year). \\n* Conserve more than 1 billion gallons of water annuallyenough for 24 million loads of laundry. \\n* Generate carbon pollution-free electricity equivalent to driving 494 million miles in electric cars (176,383 MWh/year). \\n* Support 20 projects (30% of selected projects) located in or adjacent to disadvantaged communities, creating jobs and driving local economic development. \\n* Ensure that 100% of projects comply with Made in America (Executive Order 14005) which will boost American manufacturing and good-paying Union jobs.Todays [October 29th] announcement underscores the Biden-Harris Administrations ongoing efforts to tackle the climate crisis and lead by example in Federal sustainability. More than $1 billion in funding was requested by Federal agenciesmore than ever before in the 10-year history of AFFECThighlighting the importance of the AFFECT grant program and substantial interest in clean energy initiatives. Furthermore, Phase 2 successfully leveraged all remaining funds from the $250 million Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocation made available in 2023. Applications for Phase 2 doubled compared to Phase 1, which included 31 selected projects , reflecting a surge in interest following Phase 1s record-breaking figures.As demand for AFFECT funding continues to grow, DOE is preparing for the next wave of support. With even more projects in the pipeline, Federal facilities will have additional opportunities to apply for funding to further reduce emissions, enhance resilience, and accelerate the transition to net-zero emissions. This continued investment in sustainable Federal infrastructure will not only bolster national security and energy reliability but also drive economic growth by creating good-paying jobs and fostering innovation through partnerships.A link to the full list of recipients and scope of projects is near the end of the press release. Statement from U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm:It is imperative that Federal facilities are able to operate in the face of increasingly intense extreme weather events, and the Biden-Harris Administration is leading by example through its support of energy resiliency and building efficiency measures, said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. Todays announcement will empower Federal facilities across the United States to upgrade critical infrastructure with cutting-edge, cost-effective technologies they need to improve reliability while saving taxpayers money.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces $150 Million to Advance Net-Zero Projects at Federal Facilities, Saving Taxpayers Money"},{"text":"And then they'll move back when Pierre Poilievre wins in 2025","title":"can American liberals please move to Canada?"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/pbvkf5atafyd1.jpeg?width=828&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=beeb78e052e5be1f0efe81e7b4c0969a9728b461","title":"Living his whole life on the left side of the IQ bell curve"},{"text":"Precisely.

Its almost like theyre trying to give this really fake confidence in their political choices and what they vote for is what everyone else is going to vote for. Ive never heard a democrat really say the same rhetoric when talking about the election.**Why do republicans refuse to believe election results?**If they win, the election was not rigged and all is good. If they lose people are voting without ID!! and its rigged.**Do republicans actually understand his policies?**Donald Trump is cutting taxes for the wealthy, while he may be cutting taxes for the poor we have to look at some theoretical numbers. A 5% tax cut for someone making $5M can reduce their taxes by $250,000 a year. Yet if we cut 5% taxes for someone making $85K a year thats $4,250. The person getting $4,250 back is more than likely going to spend it (recirculating the money back into the economy) rather than the rich millionaire whos going to invest that $250,000. **Do republicans actually understand what tariffs actually do?**3 CEOs (Auto zone/Columbia apparel/Black &amp; Decker) have already stated that they are going to raise the prices of consumer goods because of tariffs saying it will be very very hard to keep things affordable for Americans. Americans will cut back on spending significantly, leading to a recession since companies can no longer generate growth through profits. This will also lead to inflation since everything will be more expensive. Those companies are just going to pass on the cost to consumers. **Do republicans not realize Trump lies and he lies often?**He says no new wars when we bombed an airport in Syria in September of 2016. We also killed Soleimani in Iraq in 2020. America was not at peace, we were still bombing people in the Middle East under Trump. What happened to republicans loving war, now they want to stop the war in Ukraine.He also mentioned the Mexico border wall being paid by Mexico, we paid for it. Donald Trump criticized Obama for playing golf, but then enters office and plays 261 rounds of golf in 4 years compared to Obama playing just 98 over his 8 year career term. **Do republicans not understand trends?**Over 40 of his 44 cabinet members from his previous election no longer endorse him. His own VP from 2016 is telling people not to vote for him. These are some of the closest people to him, people that worked with him regularly and chose to not work with him again, 99.99% of the republicans do not know Donald Trump that well. These people do and they left, is that not worrisome in the slightest?**Do republicans not see how creepy Donald Trump is?**He said he would date his own daughter, he told a 10 year old girl Ill be dating you in 10 years. Like dont any of the republicans have daughters?? Wouldnt you be weirded out if some 50-60 year old man said that to your daughter?

If someone else had been chosen, especially a White man, there would have been endless debate about not giving a woman and a POC a chance. All of it would have been an incredible distraction that there simply was zero time for. I have to believe that Biden knew he was stepping down much earlier on and the Democrats worked *hard* to coalesce before he announced he was dropping out.

To unite the whole world under one banner. Sounds great, right? It depends on who is doing the globalizing. The only people who can do this are the ultrarich, the banks, the hedge funds, the MIC, the corporations.?\\nThe interconnectedness I speak of is actually insidious in nature. It only centralizes power for the above mentioned groups while taking away power from nation states. It creates a monopoly on power for the already powerful. How does this work? Corporate, banking, trade, and other economic warfare. Once a nation is globalized and interconnected, it cannot fight for its own interests. It's been totally compromised already.?\\nThe ultimate goal through this interconnectedness is total power and control of everything on the planet. It's world domination. A globalist is someone that wants to dominate the whole entire planet and advance their own goals through this process. This is easier to do if you have many powerful and monied interests working together. Why would they work together? Because it's easier and faster to achieve their collective goals that way. At the end of the day, life is still finite in terms of time. If they are successful, they get to play God.?\\nI mentioned that globalization being a good or bad thing depends on who is doing the globalizing. Look around you at the world. Are things getting better for the average person? Are wars, disease, famine, and poverty still issues? These issues could largely be solved. They are not being solved because they are part of the plan. A big thing the Globalists want is depopulation. Case in point, go read some Club of Rome publications. They talk about this openly. It's what they want, the only thing left for imagination is the means in which they will do it.?\\nThey also have their own groups/meetings. Bilderberg, CFR, Trilateral Commission, Club of Rome are the more well known ones.?\\nBasically, a globalist is an individual that wants to create a super state that spans the entire planet at the expense of all other nation states.?","title":"This site and the media have gone completely nuclear with pro left propaganda"},{"text":"Dick Cheney the most powerful VP in the history of the US.

But at that point, Trump would (AFAIK) **have no** cabinet.So far, I've never seen this particular scenario mentioned by any pundit... probably, because it would establish a *horrific* precedent, and probably has a 100% chance of getting shot down by the Supreme Court.Plan 'B' might be for the Senate (in Democratic hands) to hand Trump a short list of approvable Republicans that includes Liz and Dick Cheney, Mitt Romney, George Bush, Jeb Bush, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Adam Kinzinger, and others who are **absolutely** non- MAGA... then tell Trump that he can have an equal number of loyalists plus one... appointed in order such that he gets one loyalist, then has to alternate between short-list and loyalists.The idea is, Trump would still be vulnerable to a cabinet member turning against him, but the short-list appointees would all pledge to not vote to remove him as long as he behaves himself (defined as, \\"do nothing unhinged, and govern as a middle-of-the-road caretaker\\").More likely than not, if Trump agreed to the bargain, he'd do something worthy of a 25th-amendment removal within weeks or months *anyway*... but it would at least lay out an olive branch allowing him to govern as a responsible caretaker who acknowledges that he was elected without a majority mandate wearing velvet handcuffs.I think that if push came to shove, the Supreme Court would *grudgingly* decline to strike down a \\"Plan B\\" arrangement like this, simply because it's likely to be the least-awful option for literally everyone involved.===Oh... and for that *first* alleged-loyalist, tell him it has to be Nikki Haley. After all, she bent the knee and pledged fealty to him, so he can trust her... right? (...evil laugh...)===Update 2: it turns out, involuntary removal under the 25th Amendment is easy for a few days, but even harder than impeachment to sustain. Impeachment requires a simple majority in the House and 2/3 of the Senate. Involuntary 25A removal requires 2/3 of **both.**So... the smart strategy would probably be to just refuse any cabinet pick who hadn't gone on record *at least* opposing Trump prior to 11/5/24.","title":"If the Worst Case Scenario Happens, What Are We Supposed to Do?"},{"text":"I work with about 20 guys in a UA plumbing shop, 1 is hardcore for Harris. 1 other is an undecided who supported RFK up until the trump endorsement.

They warned of the possible fractures in our military that our country's political divisions could cause, leading to a breakdown in the chain of command and the possibility of extremists in the military involvement in a coup. These men were not alarmists -- they were speaking from the hard-earned experience of decades in uniform, and their words should serve as a wake-up call for all Americans.The goal of the exercise wasn't to scare anyone, but to ensure the nation is prepared. Democracy is fragile, and the peaceful transfer of power cannot be taken for granted. That's why we need to plan for these worst-case scenarios, to ensure our military leaders are equipped to resist illegal orders, and to protect our institutions from those who would undermine them.The exercise highlighted that the Insurrection Act, a federal law that grants the president authority to deploy U.S. military forces within the country to suppress civil disorder, insurrection or rebellion, could be misused by allowing a commander in chief broad authority to deploy troops domestically without clear limits, potentially stifling lawful dissent. It also underscored the need for reforms to the Insurrection Act itself, to prevent unchecked presidential power from undermining democratic freedoms and ensure that federal troop deployment is reserved strictly for genuine crises beyond the capacity of local authorities.**When a former president calls for its use in an election context, we must take that threat seriously.**We cannot afford to be complacent. The generals who warned of this threat in 2021 were right: The divisions in our country have deepened, and the risks have grown. The exercise I participated in was an attempt to identify and address these vulnerabilities before it's too late. But it's not just the military that needs to be prepared -- it's all of us. The responsibility to safeguard our democracy doesn't rest with any one group. It's a collective duty.Americans of all political stripes must reject the notion that the military can or should be used to settle political disputes. The strength of our democracy depends on our ability to unite, to respect the rule of law, and to ensure that our armed forces remain above the political fray.Anything less would be a betrayal of everything we've fought to protect.","title":"Trump's Dangerous Words Demand Action"},{"text":"Unbelievable, isn't it? \\nMy enemies enemy is my friend.I actually had no idea they were thinking of putting the Cheyneys in charge of the Pentagon.I expect Halliburtons stock price went up","title":"Democrats spent 25 years saying that Dick Cheney's kids should have to go fight in a war and all it took was Donald Trump agreeing with them to change their minds."},{"text":"Well, that's part of the reason.

Senior officials from the past five presidential administrations, alongside veterans and military leaders, role-played what would happen if a small number of radicalized elements of the military were to reject the results of a democratic election and back a losing candidate. It's the kind of scenario that, as a military officer, you hope you'll never see, but brings into sharp focus how fragile our democracy is and the need for constant vigilance. That exercise was memorialized in a new documentary, \\"War Game.\\"This exercise was inspired, in part, by[?an op-ed written by three retired U.S. generals](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/12/17/eaton-taguba-anderson-generals-military/)?in the wake of Jan. 6, 2021. They warned of the possible fractures in our military that our country's political divisions could cause, leading to a breakdown in the chain of command and the possibility of extremists in the military involvement in a coup. These men were not alarmists -- they were speaking from the hard-earned experience of decades in uniform, and their words should serve as a wake-up call for all Americans.The goal of the exercise wasn't to scare anyone, but to ensure the nation is prepared. Democracy is fragile, and the peaceful transfer of power cannot be taken for granted. That's why we need to plan for these worst-case scenarios, to ensure our military leaders are equipped to resist illegal orders, and to protect our institutions from those who would undermine them.The exercise highlighted that the Insurrection Act, a federal law that grants the president authority to deploy U.S. military forces within the country to suppress civil disorder, insurrection or rebellion, could be misused by allowing a commander in chief broad authority to deploy troops domestically without clear limits, potentially stifling lawful dissent. It also underscored the need for reforms to the Insurrection Act itself, to prevent unchecked presidential power from undermining democratic freedoms and ensure that federal troop deployment is reserved strictly for genuine crises beyond the capacity of local authorities.When a former president calls for its use in an election context, we must take that threat seriously.We cannot afford to be complacent. The generals who warned of this threat in 2021 were right: The divisions in our country have deepened, and the risks have grown. The exercise I participated in was an attempt to identify and address these vulnerabilities before it's too late. But it's not just the military that needs to be prepared -- it's all of us. The responsibility to safeguard our democracy doesn't rest with any one group. It's a collective duty.Americans of all political stripes must reject the notion that the military can or should be used to settle political disputes. The strength of our democracy depends on our ability to unite, to respect the rule of law, and to ensure that our armed forces remain above the political fray.Anything less would be a betrayal of everything we've fought to protect.*-- Linda L.

I'm confused why they won that debate. Anyways, I know that alternative media has risen to prominence through Joe Rogan and his associates like Theo Von, Matt and Shane Gillis (they're married), and others, as well as people like Tucker Carlson and Tim Pool (wormboy). These changes in the media landscape among older Millenials and their predecessors are being shaped and driven by conservatives actively attempting to appeal to them, while Democrats are continuing to fail to appeal to even the 5% of viewers (I genuinely believe are much higher) that can be swayed to not vote for Trump and other conservatives through simply appearing and talking about the issues that MOST Americans believe are central to their lives today and their future retirement and healthcare needs. But the Democrats are not talking to them which automatically yields the conservatives and Christofascists to win those viewers outright.Democratic strategists have so much learning and waking up to do that they have to go into the lions den in order to appeal to disaffected voters by telling them that regardless of how much they hate the Democrats today, the Republicans have been much worse historically, and intend to be even worse than that in the future. So I hope they can change their tolerance for bullshit to at least speak to people like Rogan in a conversation that presents actual evidence that supports their party platform. Evidence that points out income inequality and its effects on internal stability, government revenue and deficits, foreign policy issues like Ukraine, Israel and China, why Social Security and Medicare are so critical to reduce the risks of extreme poverty on a growing number of elderly relative to the overall population, workers rights and the right to form unions, and so on. If you just refuse to talk to people, you will let them delve deeper into echo chambers. I can guarantee you that liberals and center-left voters watch far more conservative media than people on the right do.","title":"Kamala Harris has met the moment.

This was a divergence from mainstream Republican thought of the time, where evangelicals were trying to outright ban it, or at least keep it separate-but-totally-equal from marriage.

Which could be a major factor since polls are always going to underrepresent younger voters.I remain cautiously optimistic. Everything Harris and Walz have been doing on the campaign trail seems perfect. No 2016 Hillary mistakes like ignoring swing states or assuming it's already in the bag. Meanwhile, seemingly everything Trump has been doing on the campaign trail seems to be a mistake -- and Vance might as well not exist with how quickly he was turned into a joke and how he just kept repeatedly putting his foot in his mouth.Cautious optimism.","title":"Kamala Harris' status in final polls compared with Biden, Hillary Clinton"},{"text":"his kids were past the age of enlistment","title":"Democrats spent 25 years saying that Dick Cheney's kids should have to go fight in a war and all it took was Donald Trump agreeing with them to change their minds."},{"text":"Relevant username","title":"Living his whole life on the left side of the IQ bell curve"},{"text":"The corrected the transcript.

As a veteran who has served this nation, I know firsthand the importance of keeping partisan politics out of our military. Former President Donald Trump's suggestion isn't just irresponsible -- it's a threat to the democratic system we swore to defend.During an interview with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on \\"Sunday Morning Futures,\\" Trump suggested deploying the military to address what he termed \\"the enemy from within\\" on Election Day. He said his concerns were less about chaos from his own supporters or foreign actors and more about others in America.*\\"We have some very bad people. We have some sick people. Radical left lunatics,\\" Trump said. \\"I think it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can't let that happen.\\"*The idea of using military force to suppress political opposition is more than mere rhetoric; it undermines the very principles of civilian control of the military and the peaceful transfer of power. Our Founding Fathers understood this. That's why they created safeguards like the Posse Comitatus Act, designed to prevent the military from being used as a tool of political power. These safeguards are there to prevent abuses of power, and to keep our nation from slipping into authoritarianism. When a former president casually disregards these protections, we should all take notice.","title":"Trump's Dangerous Words Demand Action"},{"text":"Pure hype as we have 24 straight years of Dem women as President (Kamala then Big Gretch then AOC).","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 1, 2024 - 4 days until election day!"},{"text":"Depends on the state.

They still have both sides of the political spectrum bought and paid for by them, in most countries. Why the political left though??\\nDestruction of sovereignty and borders through mass migration. This is paramount in order to eliminate nation states and centralize their power and control. What the globalists really want is world domination. Can't have that with nation states. The secondary part, which is mass migration, dilutes the values, culture, and economics of the host population while providing a loyal voting block, a slave wage class, and a potential army in the event that the host population turns violent on the government. The last part is why they call anyone against mass migration a racist. They are building a narrative.?\\nThe globalists have also successfully turned the left into a bunch of warmongering psychopaths through propaganda. The globalists will initiate conflicts and disasters all over the world by proxy, politically, covertly, militarily, or through regime change. The media and vassal governments will then peddle a narrative, which is usually the same narrative as last time, that some brutal Hitler wannabe initiated a conflict thousands of miles away and that we have to stop him because we are the good guys. Remember what I said about the goals of the globalists? It's world domination. Everything that is going on in the world geopolitically is due to that. America is the main military arm of this goal. Global depopulation is also one of their goals, so wars are always good for them.?\\nThis brings me to my next reason for why the globalists have chosen the left. Traditionally, the left has always been about social justice and LGBTQ. This greatly benefits the globalists. They have magnified and promoted the LGTBQ. Not to protect those people, but to turn the children gay. If they can successfully convince most of the younger generations that they are gay or non binary, those people will not have children, thus depopulation. It also partially legitimizes the sexual deviancy of the globalists by making degeneracy more open. This also degrades the core values of western societies, which is the natural enemy of the globalists.?\\nTraditionally, the left has been pro average person. The globalists have used this to their advantage by having their vassal governments enact legislation or taxes or economic policies that have destroyed the living standards of average people. Case in point, carbon taxes. They do nothing to prevent carbon emissions, but they do make prices rise. Mass migration, lowers wages across the board and increases prices of everything due to insufficient supply. Free trade, allows corporate slave labour, kills entire industries at home, yet prices are still marked up by an insane amount. The government and the medias job is to convince people that these policies benefit average people. The left moniker helps accomplish this.?\\nI had more ideas, but forgot them as I was writing.?","title":"This site and the media have gone completely nuclear with pro left propaganda"},{"text":"I sure hope so, but im afraid Diddy was the scapegoat that will keep the higher demons and their degenerate activities safe.. at least for a while before another huge thing gets leaked.

The president cannot just send money to a foreign power without Congress passing it with bipartisan support. This is an issue with both Democrats AND Republicans, and independents/moderate Republicans are absolutely repelled by harsh language towards Israel due to history.Moderates/Republican swing voters are the demographic that will help her win this, not leftists.So you have to look at it from a tactical POV and have and LITTLE bit of faith that she's not deaf and dumb. Read between the lines a bit.Netanyahu doesn't want her to win. He's talked with Trump about delaying the ceasefire just to fuck her over. She skipped his speech to Congress outright and has a meeting with them that left him *bitter*.She has needed to be smart about this, while also taking in to account that she literally is not in any position to do anything about it regardless.I understand peoples' inclination to empathize with Palestinians, but this is about more than just Gaza. This is about our country too, and in order for Gaza to have any semblance of a chance, she needs to win, and if she wants to win, she needs to carefully skirt whatever tight rope her data is telling her to skirt, and frankly she's been a damn near trapeze artist on that front.Tactical maneuvers take priority over purely righteous ones when you're up against an opponent who literally just lies in every breath, and when winning is of the UTMOST importance. I'd rather she be meh on Gaza and win, than have been a complete bonafide Pro-Palestinian candidate and lose. It's about the big picture.That being said, I do not consider her \\"missteps on Gaza\\" to be actual missteps. No. It's all been a tactical maneuver.

I loved Obamas rhetoric and the class with which he embodied the American presidency. But I am disappointed in what he overall achieved and the risks he didn't take. Biden has achieved so much more and has no public speaking persona to him - but maybe that's the rub. There is no perfect package of soaring rhetoric and life-altering policies or legislating.

Morris had reopened the idea of a president (then elected by congress) being ineligible to run a second time, and from there floated the idea that maybe the president oughtn't be elected by Congress at all. I believe Madison was the fifth person to speak in that conversation, and only after multiple people before him had already endorsed the possibility of an electoral college for other reasons. This doesn't detract that the very debate that Madison made those remarks was in the framework of trying to deal with the potential that the President and the Congress wouldn't be adequately separated, and he was simply listing his preferred order of alternatives. The takeaway from that debate should in no way be that the presence of slavery was the only reason that anyone considered having an electoral college.","title":"CMV: The Electoral College is not great, but is better than a Popular Vote in that it represents a closer bridge to Parliamentarianism and could bolster the integrity of State Governments (if done well), both of which I consider to be positives."},{"text":"Bro have you ever seriously tried to listen to Michael Savage on the radio?

Well, I have something super cool to share!As some of you know, I have a strong background in coding, and have recently been playing around with AI tools.  I've created a beta version of an AI that analyzes early votes, voter demographics, political trends, and polling (only the reliable ones, of course), and gives a quick summary of how likely certain outcomes are.So for example, I typed in: \\"Will Jon Tester win the 2024 Montana Senate race\\", and after running its analysis, the AI told me that he will **most likely** win.I also gave it a lower-visibility race, asking \\"Will Janelle Bynum win the race in Oregon's 5th District?\\" and it simply told me **\\"Yes.\\"**  It seems to add up with what I've seen so far!Want to try it out?  Go ahead and ask a question, and I'll put it into the AI.  Let's get some solid predictions going in here!EDIT: Just realized some of the techy people here might want details on the AI's programming and how it's set up to gather data.  I've included those details in spoiler tags below:!I lied.  I just used a Magic 8-ball to answer every one of your questions.  But it's an important reminder: There's going to be lots of confident takes out there, and you shouldn't believe any of them.  We'll know the results on November 5th; until then, tune out the noise and keep working hard.  Also, if anyone uses AI to predict anything, ignore them even harder.
