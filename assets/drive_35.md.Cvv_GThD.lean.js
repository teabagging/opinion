You nailed what it refers to pretty specifically with a pattern of controlling behaviour in which one partner emotionally manipulates the other, gaslights them, threatens them etc.People using it incorrectly doesnt mean it is itself broad and vague. I mean, OCD and ADHD both have actual definitions and set of symptoms, but people use those terms incorrectly all the time to mean things like Oh, Im tidy or Im so flaky!People misusing terms does not make the terms themselves broad and vague.2: it is very often misappliedSee above. People misapply all sorts of terms. This is not grounds for doing away with the terms.3: it stigmatises a mental health conditionNarcissistic personality disorder is a genuine psychological conditionYes it is. It is a mental disorder.  If schizophrenic abuse and autistic abuse are not a thing then neither should narcissistic abuse be a thing.Ah, but neither schizophrenia nor autism is a mental disorder in the same class as NPD. Schizophrenia is a mental illness, and autism is neither a mental illness or a disorder but instead neurodivergence. Regardless, narcissistic abuse describes the pattern of abuse itself, the mechanism, not that the person doing the abusing has NPD. Narcissism is its own word with its own definition that applies to both the type of personality disorder AND the type of abuse. NPD does not have a sole claim on the term. Kind of like sexual assault/abuse describes what form the abuse takes or what motivated it, but sexual assault isn't the only term that's allowed to use the word 'sexual', which has its own definition that applies to many things.Narcissistic abuse is OFTEN afflicted by people with NPD, but not solely by people with NPD. There are abusive people with those conditions, perhaps even as a result of failing to manage those conditions properly, but the stigmatisation and demonisation is still bad.Ah, but there is also narcissistic abuse without the abuser having NPD. Suppose you do have NPD. If narcissistic abuse is a thing then how can a diagnosed narcissist not engage in it? It gives them no incentive to changeLots of people diagnosed with NPD or other personality disorders arent abusive. The fact that the abuse is narcissistic in nature doesnt mean that every narcissist is abusive, just like the abuse beings sexual in nature means that everything that is sexual is abuse. Being held accountable for abuse either morally, criminally, or socially is what gives abusers incentive to change, not the label put on their abuse.This is like saying if abusive drunks are a thing then how can a diagnosed alcoholic not engage in it?Ive seen a lot of people who think they are narcissists who are clearly actually autistic or OCD. Firstly, you can have NPD AND autism or OCD. Secondly, unless youre an actual psychologist or psychiatrist seeing these people in a clinical setting, then you are the one armchair diagnosing here.Suppose someone is genuinely being abused by someone with actual NPD. Although such thoughts are unjustified, its easy for victims to feel sorry for their abuser and to reason something like hes not evil hes just ill, I should stay with him and help him get better.This is a false line of reasoning. Should we not call alcoholism a disease because victims will feel sorry for their abusers just being ill? Should we not call psychopathy a condition because, well, same thing? As someone who was genuinely abused by someone with NPD, someone with BPD, and a pedophile, I can tell you that the guilt can be real when you go to leave an abusive situation but the hes not evil, just ill argument is an excuse, not a reason. And its usually formed *because* of the abusive person manipulating the victims emotions. Its along the same lines as he said hed kill himself if I left. Its a tactic abusers use to get victims to stay.I knew full well my BPD abuser was ill when I said goodbye to that abusive situation. It was not an excuse for me to stay, because it was not an excuse for me to allow them to hurt me. If you swing your fist, I dont care if youre doing it consciously or because youre flailing about with a seizure C Im going to move out of the way. Not bringing awareness that narcissistic abuse IS abuse is far more likely to get people to stay with an abuser than calling it what it is. Forbidding the term narcissistic abuse will just change what the abusers use to manipulate their victims into staying with them anyway. They wont even bat an eyelash doing it.Physical abuse. Gf controls your bank account and wont let you spend your own money? Financial abuse. Spouse goes through your phone when youre not around? Controlling abuse.And when one indulges in a pattern of all three including emotional manipulation, gaslighting, etc? Why wouldnt we call that narcissistic abuse, which is defined as:  a pattern of controlling behaviour in which one partner emotionally manipulates the other, gaslights them, threatens them etc.Again, narcissistic abuse =/= NPD. People can have NPD and not be abusive. People can indulge in narcissistic abuse and not have NPD. Narcissism is its own term with its own definition and is *not* the same as NPD, or interchangeable with it. The narcissistic in narcissistic abuse refers to the pattern and motivation of the abuse, NOT the disorder of NPD, which is a separate thing.","title":"CMV: narcissistic abuse is not a helpful term and should be retired from use"},{"text":"Theres actually a surprising number of ferries on the major rivers in the Midwest as well.

In one of his infamous rages, he shouted \\"*What miserable drones and traitors have I nourished and promoted in my household, who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born clerk!\\"* (this is from Edward Grim, who was present when Henry II received the letter alerting him of Becketts actions).A few of Henry's knights were also present at the scene, and hearing this phrase, took it as a command. They traveled to Canterbury Cathedral, and entered the cathedral on the evening of 29DEC1170. They confronted Beckett, who was praying at the altar, and brutally butchered him, before desecrating his body, all in front of the altar of Christ.When news came out of this assassination, Henry II claimed innocence (which was likely, seeing as he was known to shout outlandish things in his fits of pique), but it would precipitate the end of his reign regardless. He flagellated himself in front of the city, apologized profusely, even let the monks whip him themselves, but it didn't matter, because he had created arguably the most famous martyr of the period and villanized himself in the eyes of the pious. He was later overthrown by his own son, King Richard I Plantagenet.The phrase that he actually shouted was later shortened to the phase \\"Who will rid me of this troublesome priest\\".I really love medieval history lol this was just an excuse to talk about it for me.","title":"Dems send message to violent supporters: Who will rid us of this meddlesome Trump?"},{"text":"Dont trust the polls anywhere!

Were gonna be taking in trillions of dollars, and as much as childcare is talked about as being expensive, its relatively speaking not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers well be taking in.

I had some go as far as say that they wanted Sarah Palin, which is kinda a signifying moment of when I knew it was bad.

My views and understanding are much different, I'm just being the devil's advocate and relaying my anecdotal understandings from the time and since.

As that shrinks, it gets harder to do that and as such direct messaging gets more difficult. Now there are ways to get around that, but the ultimate, long term impact of this is unknowable. The Dems could tailor a message that is receptive to all Americans. However, the GOP has an advantage in that its homogenous coalition can do the same with much more success. Let me put it another way: if one political party is diverse and one isnt, the first one will have to create a message so generic that it almost seems useless and without meaning. For example, Free healthcare, free college, higher wages, seems great to a lot of the people in that first group, but not all. The second group can tailor a message to the majority of its supporters and a few stragglers that would be just enough to keep them happy and voting for them.  Because their party is so homogeneous, they have the ability to be both selective and broad. They can appeal to the majority of their supporters and to a certain segment of the other parties voters that the first one will have a harder time doing. This conundrum is exactly where we are right now.","title":"Democrats Cant Rely on the Black Church Anymore"},{"text":"He could turn things around with decent policies and getting rid of the swamp monsters dragging us down.

If that were to happen, it would be a kinda huge deal. Its not hard to argue that the easiest way the US has to alleviate human suffering is to allow more immigrants (even if its more efficient to send money on high-efficiency causes, that costs money - immigrants earn money for the US, while dramatically improving their quality of life, and improving often life in the country that they left).

A more normie Republican would probably be crushing it with independents right now, but (a) a normie would never win a primary and (b) Trump would disavow them so theyd lose the base (or worse, Trump runs third party and splits the vote). And Trump will forever have his influence on the party as long as he lives because Republicans think the elections are stolen from him.

In four words it declares that there are problems and he wants to solve them. Only with the support of the people can we 'make America great again.' It's active, it's powerful, and it absolutely declares both a vision and a direction for what Trump claimed he wanted to do. Now we all know that's bullshit but, just on messaging, Hillary's slogan was all about her and only her while Trump made his about 'the people.'Now compare both to 'We're not going back' and 'When we fight, we win!' Both of those are calls to action, they're active, and they play off of 'Yes We Can' from the Obama era. It places, like Obama and Trump, the power of the statement behind the supporters and not just the candidate.

I think overall it is fair to say it was mentioned too often to the point it overshadowed many of the more nuanced, political reasons to vote for her.  Now things are a little different, because the country knows that a woman can clearly get the votes after seeing the turnout for Clinton in that election. They have done an excellent job presenting Harris in a light that prioritizes showcasing her leadership skills, as a woman, rather than depicting her as a woman first, who is also a leader. It was too easy back then to derail Clinton and create the perception that being the first woman president was the main thing she brought to the table. Thats a broad oversimplification that doesnt accurately cover how things have been different for the two women, but in general what I mean to say is that they have done a great job balancing the narratives and helping voters understand who Harris really is in a integrated way, by keeping the conversation around her focused on the important parts of what kind of leader she aims to be  most of which really have nothing to do with the gender of a person, but their character and experiences.","title":"Hillary Clinton: It would be exhilarating to see Kamala Harris achieve the breakthrough I didnt"},{"text":"At some point, Democrats will have 51 Senators who will comfortably vote to either kill the filibuster or (more likely) suspending the filibuster on abortion related votes.

He never endorsed a riotLol. I can never tell if you guys really believe this stuff or if you're just trying to sell it to us.Donald Trump, the then-sitting US President, gave an incendiary speech to a massive crowd of people, some of whom were armed. The Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and Three-Percenters had been in contact with Rally organizers, Michael Flynn, and Roger Stone, and they, in turn, [had been in contact with Trump](https://www.npr.org/2022/07/12/1111132464/jan-6-hearing-recap-oath-keepers-proud-boys). Speaking in front of the White House and the Seal of the Presidency, he said:'We won this election, and we won it by a landslide''We will stop the steal''If you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore''We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn't happen... You don't concede when there's theft involved. Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore.'and'We are going to the Capitol'.But you think because he threw in 'Peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard', that undoes the rest of the speech, along with the months he spent whipping his base into a frenzy? Do you *really* think that? Especially after I just provided **[proof](https://www.doioig.gov/sites/default/files/2021-migration/SpecialReview_Review%20of%20the%20U.S.%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior%E2%80%99s%20Actions%20Related%20to%20January%206%2C%202021.pdf)** that he told his campaign and the rally organizers that he was going to call for a march, but none of them mentioned that to Capitol Police or the NPS. The NPS, by the way, asked J6 organizers several times if they were going to march and were told 'no' again and again. Why, if they wanted a peaceful protest, did they lie?The President of the United States told an angry crowd that just a few blocks away, their democracy was being stolen. The accusation is serious. If true, the riot would be justified. Freedom and democracy, when legitimately threatened, are worth fighting, dying, and possibly killing for. That's a foundational American principle. Trump, the most powerful person in the world, with access to the best intelligence gathering services in the world, told them their government, their rights, their freedom, their system of laws was under attack just a short walk away.But despite all that, you think one 'peacefully' was proof he wanted civility? That one word just wipes all the rest away? *REALLY?* When he said Mexicans were rapists bringing drugs and crime, it magically wasn't racist because he threw in 'and some, I assume, are good people'? Is that how that works?I guess you're the kind of person who voted to acquit mob bosses before RICO laws because they weren't technically the ones committing the murders or shaking down businesses, right? I guess you think Henry II was actually surprised when the Archbishop of Canterbury turned up dead after saying '[Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_no_one_rid_me_of_this_turbulent_priest%3F)'Nah. I hope for your sake you're just hoping I'm dumb, because if you really think that, he's got an even tighter grip on you than I thought.","title":"Trump is a threat to democracy.

Vote splitting may give you the superficial satisfaction of voting for different candidates across races, but in reality, it often leads to incoherent governance and undermines the very policies you claim to care about. A straight ticket, or a split ticket, under the current system ignores the fact that you're just shifting your influence from one individual to another, with little regard for how their platforms align, how theyll legislate, or how that impacts broader governance.In a Single Vote system, youre not losing your 'right to choose' - youre gaining a more focused and coherent influence on policy. Rather than diluting your vote across a series of disconnected individual candidates who may not even align with your overall preferences, you'd be choosing a party that reflects your values and agenda across all levels of governance. This strengthens your agency rather than dispersing it thin.The system doesnt take away your ability to care about representation - it redirects that energy into something more meaningful. If you genuinely care about the inner workings of governance and policy, you should want a party that represents you collectively and has the accountability to fulfill its platform, not a disjointed array of candidates who may or may not have the expertise or fidelity for the positions they hold.As for your involvement in campaigns, great - then you understand how fragmented the current system is. Volunteering, phone banking, etc., would be far more effective in a system where party platforms, not personalities, drive policy. You wouldn't be 'limited' - you'd be investing your time in shaping broader, unified party strategies, not playing whack-a-mole with individual candidates who often fall prey to personalism and demagoguery.","title":"An argument for the Single Vote"},{"text":"Also there's only so much ground game can actually move the needle.

Local and state party branches possess the expertise and focus needed for governance appropriate to their jurisdictions, such as education, infrastructure, and basic services. Meanwhile, federal branches are primarily concerned with interstate and international platforms. In a multiparty system, the relationship between local, state, and federal parties could function more like shifting coalitions rather than the top-down hierarchy many Americans associate with national parties.  In multiparty systems, parties emerge, evolve and die off in response to environmental dynamics.  Such would likely be just as true across levels of government.Under the Single Vote system, a more multiparty environment would encourage voters to focus on state-level politics as the nexus of their electoral decisions. This could have the downstream effect of somewhat depoliticizing federal and local governance, reorienting partisanship around state _and_ federal issues rather than relying purely on national narratives. Furthermore, federal parties would emerge as a reflection of the combined will of the state parties, rather than dictating policies from above. This approach would allow voters to support parties that align with their priorities at the appropriate level of governance, while encouraging cooperation and compromise across different layers of government.\\" This all emphasizes the flexibility and adaptability of political parties in a proportional, multiparty system, where local knowledge and collaboration would reduce the risks of voters feeling 'forced' to support a party with conflicting interests across various levels of government.","title":"An argument for the Single Vote"},{"text":"I'm always sceptical when anyone says landslide victory, but reading their prediction, holy crap, that's one helluva landslide.

The lawyers maintain that the Jan. 6 case should be promptly thrown out as a consequence of the Supreme Court immunity decision in Trump v. United States and the special counsels stubborn reliance on details about Trumps communications with then Vice President Mike Pence in the superseding indictment.Trump is throwing everything that the wall. The SolarWinds hack, FISA abuses, it's a laundry list of every buzzword he can remember from his time in office. I don't see it getting thrown out right away, but not all communication between Trump and Pence would be official acts, if they're talking about Campaign or Re-election stuff, that's them talking as failed candidates in a private capacity. I think Trump is scared that the Judge will decide that communications between Trump and Pence count as unofficial/private acts, where if he gets them recognized as official acts they can not be used as evidence.Trump lawyers and prosecutors recently wrangled in U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkans courtroom on how best to proceed with the case that Smith tailored to emphasize the defendants alleged private conduct as a candidate to overturn his 2020 election loss. While the judge was clear that she was not at all concerned about scheduling deadlines in the lead-up to the not relevant 2024 election, Trump attorney John Lauro immediately asserted that protecting the integrity of the upcoming election was one of several reasons the case should be thrown out.Maybe Trump should have thought of that before siccing his mob on the Capitol?Among the others? That the false and exaggerated allegations relating to Pence render the revised indictment void ab initio, a fancy way of saying doomed from the get-go.This case should be dismissed. Promptly. That is the only just course of action consistent with (1) the Supreme Courts decision in Trump v. United States; (2) the critically important institutional interests that support the Presidential immunity doctrine; and (3) the stubborn reliance by the Special Counsels Office on allegations relating to Vice President Pence that are, at least, presumptively immune, Lauro said. Dismissal is required to protect the integrity of the Presidency and the upcoming election, as well as the Constitutional rights of President Trump and the American people. There are also ongoing discovery violations in this case that implicate Presidential immunity and other strong defenses, including the Offices failure to produce exculpatory evidence concerning the flaws with this prosecution and the Offices false allegations.\\"Presumptively immune\\" sounds pretty fragile, if a cursory glance at their conversation would reveal if it was official or not. I would throw out his entire argument about the integrity of the election being at risk, it's more at risk without the facts presented for the public. hen the Supreme Court ruled in Trump v. United States and walled off his conversations with DOJ officials, the justices did note that it would be up to prosecutors to file documents rebutting the presumption of immunity and up to Chutkan to rule whether allowing Trumps conversations ahead of Jan. 6 with Pence into evidence will pose any dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.It shouldn't pose a lot of trouble of the Executive, since if Trump was discussing private Candidate matters with Pence those are unofficial acts. If they're interspersed with official acts though, that makes it a bit harder to navigate. Like if Pence asked Trump to send in the National Guard, that's official, but if Trump talks past him about \\"stopping the steal\\" is that an official act cause it's in reply to the VP asking for military back up, or unofficial since it's Candidate Trump talking not President Trump?The defense said that Smith clearly cannot meet its burden of rebutting the presumption of immunity, but before the special counsel even attempts to make that case, the judge must put immunity briefing on the back-burner and rule first on their myriad discovery requests. At least one of those requests relates to Pence, but not for the reason you might expect.Trumps clearly cooked on this, but he doesn't pay Lawyers to tell the truth. But before she smacks him down on that (I hope) she has to wade through the flood of ketchup he's flung at the wall.Trumps team argued that they are entitled to documents about the classified-information mishandling investigation into Pence for witness impeachment purposes.If Vice President Pence committed crimes that DOJ elected not to prosecute for discretionary reasons, that benefit must be disclosed, the reply said. This is one of the certain situations where external facts support a specific bias, or motive to testify in a particular way that is admissible to impeach a witness.'If Pence flipped on Trump to avoid his own trial, Trumps team is claiming that evidence is inadmissible, so they have to hand over the documents about Pence to show the evidence is allowable or not. I don't think anything will come of this, but IDK.Another stated area of interest for the defense is getting an answer from prosecutors on whether there were government agents present at the U.S. Capitol on January 6[.]One straightforward reply to President Trumps demand for disclosures relating to government agents present at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 would be to explain, if true, that there are no responsive materials. The Special Counsels Office did not do so, the filing said, claiming that if there were operatives that would mitigate the charged offense(s) and cast doubt on the credibility [and] accuracy of Jack Smiths evidence.I think this is for the Qanon crowd, who claim the whole thing was a false flag lead by antifa and the FBI (who do not like each other). But I don't think it mitigates anything, Federal Agents regularly infiltrate right wing groups, that doesn't invalidate the entire investigation or trial. he defense further claimed that discovery on the SolarWinds hack was relevant and necessary to buttress Trumps good-faith doubts about election security.Yeah the CISA director told the public that the election was safe, but Trumps case hinges on him being allowed to not believe that. He needs it to be at least ambiguous to claim plausible deniability that he knew he lost fair and square.","title":"Trump demands Jan. 6 judge promptly throw out Jack Smiths revised indictment for stubborn reliance on Mike Pence, seeks discovery on government operatives"},{"text":"\\"Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.\\" \\\\~ Frank Wilhoit","title":"Good progress Texans, it's okay to be Austin-Weird, but not useless-Rafael-weird.

He also suspended Trumps remain in Mexico policy, which required asylum seekers to wait for U.S. hearings in Mexico. That is why somewhere around 9 million illegals have entered the US. The most in American history.      THERE WOULDT HAVE BEEN THE NEED FOR THAT SENATE BILL IF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION DIDNT MESS WITH THE BORDER POLICY TRUMP HAD IN PLACE TO BEGIN WITH. The reason that Senate bill was voted down by Republicans is because it gave the executive branch emergency authority to bar most migrants from seeking asylum if unauthorized immigration at the border reaches an average of 5,000 encounters a day during seven consecutive days.

Meanwhile Harris and Walz have run a really disciplined campaign. They have a plan and stuck to it, but have also shown a willingness to adapt as they move forward.The Harris/Walz on the ground efforts are strong, with numerous volunteers who can focus on getting voters to the polls. This has allowed the candidates to decrease the margins in areas that they probably will not win outright. It is also consistent with Harris's message about being a President for all people. I have also been impressed with their online and social media efforts. Their social media posts are witty and while sometimes cutting, they rarely seem petty. Their online 'Town Hall' events, such as the one with Oprah last night, are smart because they increase enthusiasm, which has translated into more volunteers and money. All that said, this is still way closer than it should be. We cannot be complacent. This election will be won in the margins.

Most people skip from topic to topic. What I find interesting is that if he received a settlement that is easy to prove and this video corroborates the stories Cassie gave in her lawsuit. Diddy settled with her to the tune of millions. While not an admission of guilt as attorneys love to point out, who the fuck shells out millions to some grifter with a bullshit story full of lies. I'll tell you who. No one. So the haters may claim this is bullshit but some of it is verifiably true. It is also curious to contemplate this part: the card game. Steve Jackson launched that card game, I believe, in 1983 or somewhere around that time. That means he had to have at least completed the prototype of the game before that date. So sometime in the very early eighties Trump is added to a weird illuminati card game. The first mention of Trump in the press is 1973 [https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2015/07/30/1973-meet-donald-trump/](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2015/07/30/1973-meet-donald-trump/) so he was in the media. But this is the perfect sub to point this out. That means whatever goes on is planned DECADES in advance and that is certainly conspiratorial. That is not a new concept for most of us here but it is a very curious clue. But consider this.Jackson's company and home was raided by the Secret Service in 1990. At that time the SS was under the Dept of Treasury and was tasked with conducting investigations into currency and financial-payment crime, and protecting U.S. political leaders. Ummm. Okay. Because the raid gets classified under Operation Sundevil but it wasn't. And what they claimed as justification for the raid didn't fall under SS. So Jackson sued and won two of three cases. So this guy who creates a weird card game has his home raided by the SS and then later proves in court they were negligent.Lots to unpack in this video and I encourage people to do so. ref here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve\\\\_Jackson\\\\_Games,\\\\_Inc.\\\\_v.\\\\_United\\\\_States\\\\_Secret\\\\_Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jackson_Games,_Inc._v._United_States_Secret_Service)","title":"Diddy \\"sex slave\\" arrested in Miami at Trumps Golf Course after firing shots, 2018."},{"text":"She's unlikeable **within** liberal circles as well.

Actual governments in the real world have elements of various forms that may or may not align with what they officially say their government is. Of all of the terms, almost none is more widely applicable (and widely abused) as \\"constitutional\\", with \\"republic\\" perhaps being a close second.North Korea is also a \\"constitutional republic\\" in the sense that they have a constition and hold elections. Britain is \\"constitutional monarchy\\" in the sense that they have a monarch, but neither designation tells us much about how they operate.

No bounce happened because its an antiquated concept in this election, and maybe going forward. So any good numbers Harris got were pushed down.Two: PA had a bunch of pro-Trump polls. Nate's model is probability based which creates a bit of a funny outcome. During that time Harris' odds of winning Nevada and Georgia increased. Yet PA decreased. A probability model says that the odds of winning one state is much easier than the odds of winning two states. RCP, which does an averages forecast, said that Kamala had a winning board at the time (because with Nevada and Georgia she didnt need PA.)

It can also not get out about the march because I will be in trouble with the national park service and all the agencies but **POTUS is going to just call for it unexpectedly**Trump said at the debate he had nothing to do with the riot, when we have irrefutable evidence that he not only *planned* on sending the mob to the Capitol, but planners *kept that fact hidden* from officials.

I say, What would happen if the boat sank from its weight? And youre in the boat and you have this tremendously powerful battery, and the battery is now underwater, and theres a shark thats approximately 10 yards over there.By the way, a lot of shark attacks lately. You notice that? A lot of shark. I watch some guys justifying it today. Well, they werent really that angry. They bit off the young ladys leg because of the fact that they werethey were not hungry, but they misunderstood what-who she was. These people are crazy.Theres no problem with sharks. They just didnt really understand a young woman swimming. No really got decimated and other people too, a lot of shark attacks, Trump recalled, his voice pitching. So I said, So theres a shark 10 yards away from the boat, 10 yards or here. Do I get electrocuted? If the boat is sinking, water goes over the battery, the boat is sinking. Do I stay on top of the boat and get electrocuted? Or do I jump over by the shark and not get electrocuted?Because I will tell you, he didnt know the answer. He said, You know, nobodys ever asked me that question. I said, I think its a good question. I think theres a lot of electric current coming through that water. But you know what Id do if there was a shark or you get electrocuted? Ill take electrocution every single time. Im not getting near the shark!

Hell yes, but Im not exactly getting my hopes up of setting those expectations as a Texas voter..yet\\nWhat are my hopes and expectations are for this election cycle are in Texas are for those margins to shrink significantly.- Cruz via Beto in 2018 was the closest State Wide election weve had in a long time.  With Beto losing by only 2.5 points.  A whopping drop from the 15.8 points he won by in 2012.  If Allred can drop that to  within less of percentage point Id be happy for what that indicates for this state going forward.- Thatll also be in line with other races.  Trump only won Texas by 5.5 points in 2020, down from the 9 points he won by in 2016, and way down from the 16 point margin Romney won by in 2012. If Harris can get this within 2 points, thatll be very encouraging for the state going into future elections. - Hopefully thatll also impact other state wide Texas elections in 2026 and beyond.  Abbot still won the Governors race by 9 points in 2022, but that was down from 13 points in 2018, and 21 points in 2014.   John Cornyns senate seat is up in 2026.  He won by just under 10 points in 2020, but that was also way down from the 25 point margin he won by in 2014.   Even if the Texas Governor and the Senate seat thats not Ted Cruz is safe for at least another decade they are also trending in the wrong direction for the GOP.  Also indicators that Texas is becoming more and more purple.","title":"Can Democrats flip Texas Senate seat? Rep. Allred challenging Ted Cruz"},{"text":"Trump uniquely drives Republican turnout.

A number of governors  including Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker  have said theyve seen orders for masks and other needed equipment canceled because the federal government outbid them. This has led to some finding creative ways to disguise their orders to mask them from the Trump administration. Its like being on eBay with 50 other states, bidding on a ventilator, Illinois legislators rushed to deliver a $3.4 million check to a middleman at a McDonalds parking lot so that the supplier he represented wouldnt cancel the deal in favor of other, potentially more lucrative offers. They successfully handed off the check, and secured a shipment of 1.5 million N95 respirators from China.https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/19/nation/mass-hospital-executive-says-he-was-questioned-by-fbi-while-buying-equipment/  \\n Finally, a lead from an acquaintance of a friend of a team member came through: It looked as though Baystate would be able to buy a large shipment of respirators and face masks. They would cost more than five times what the organization would normally pay, he said, but it was a decent deal compared with what other sellers are now charging.\\n \\n The supply team received samples to be sure they would fit properly, but Artenstein said he wanted to inspect the final shipment before buying it D just to be sure. Four of his team members flew to the mid-Atlantic April 8 to receive the masks, and Artenstein followed by car to make the final call on whether to buy it.\\n \\n Two semi-trailer trucks, cleverly marked as food-service vehicles, met us at the warehouse, Artenstein wrote. When fully loaded, the trucks would take two distinct routes back to Massachusetts to minimize the chances that their contents would be detained or redirected.\\n \\n In retrospect, he told the Globe, the cloak-and-dagger move with the trucks may have been overkill, but he believes it was worth doing. He noted that the equipment remains under 24-hour guard, which is normal for drugs, but not for protective gear.\\n \\n The concern was that somewhere, at some point some ... authority or a regulatory body might have looked to try to seize the equipment, he said. It might have been overstated, but thats the way we felt.\\n \\n Just before the team arrived, Baystate learned that the shipment would include just a quarter of what they had ordered. But they decided to go anyway. After inspecting a few boxes, Artenstein wrote, he was ready to pull the trigger.\\n \\n Thats when two FBI agents showed up","title":"Trump Tries to Close Off a Chief Line of Attack: That Hes a Danger to Democracy"},{"text":"For me it is not about black white male female or personality who is the better choice for the country - #trump2024","title":"As someone who doesnt normally follow politics or the news, Ive done my research and Ill be supporting Donald Trump in 2024."},{"text":"Seems that after the 2020 polling error that favored Republicans, pollsters overcorrected for the 2022 cycle showing a likely \\"red wave\\" that never came to be.

A few reasons why:1. Non polling indicators are actually aligning with polls this year, unlike 2016 and 2020. The Washington Primary and special elections are both pointing to environment slightly to the left of 2020. 2. The political environment is different. Dobbs very much changed the landscape of voter turnout. Thats why Dems did well in 2022 when all fundamentals said they wouldnt. 3. Trump actually underperformed most primary polls this year. This not only busts the myth that Trump always overperforms, but also makes the case that the magic of Trump may be gone. This is the first election cycle we have seen Trump consistently underperform since he entered politics. (Including primaries) I also havent seen nearly as many Trump signs or bumper stickers in rural Pennsylvania. 4. Voter registration data. Newly registered voters this cycle are disproportionately young, female, and POC. Newly registered voters are both much more likely to vote and often dont show up in polls (at least initially) because of the lag in states updating their rolls that are used for polling data. Im not saying a polling error underestimating Trump again is impossible.

I will say my default is feeling that in any Trump election, things will go at least 2-4 points in the Republican direction from polls. It leads me to be uncomfortable with anything less than a 3 point lead. But logically, with adjustments, it's always possible that this election it goes the other way right? Things seemed to go towards Democrats in the 22 midterms. But Trump specifically always just seems to pull voters from out of the boonies that never vote and don't get counted in polls.

Listen, if you're +1 nationally, and polling even or negative in PA/WI/MI, you are behind as a Democrat and on the way to loss.The real question in my mind is now that Harris is constantly pulling +4, +5, +6 nationally, as well as strong state polls, how it is 50/50?And it's because the model thinks that the economy is bad enough that the incumbent will do poorly, so that's baked in. As we get closer to the election and those fundamentals drop off and it goes to only polls, that will change.But Nate's numbers include the current state of national and states, and we all know that you need +2.5% nationally to make it 50/50.

Gas prices spiked after he canceled the Keystone XL pipeline, and his war on domestic energy production has made the U.S. more reliant on foreign oil. The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan not only damaged Americas reputation globally but also left American citizens and allies behind. It was a disaster that showed a complete lack of leadership and planning.And Kamala, well, where has she been? She was supposed to take charge of the border crisis, but illegal crossings have surged to historic levels, straining communities and overwhelming border patrol. Biden and Kamala have focused more on social justice messaging and less on the real crises affecting everyday Americans.The sad reality is, the country feels less secure, less prosperous, and more divided than it has in years.

Nothing is being added by the sophisticated models.I have found this especially annoying because the model maker themselves keep disclaiming any actual value they might be able to bring to the table. Like, for example, folks like Silver, and Morris and whoever, and whoever are constantly making a point about how the numbers are not overly specific, and you should not narrow in on numbers to the exact decimal point or whatever. Or people saying that the variance in the results is very wide because of the possibility of polling errors or massive swings between now and the election. And yes, thats all true, but if thats all true of what value is hour projection? It just undermines the entire purpose of why you are building a model in the first place. Its all kind of useless, and self congratulatory and masturbatory. The older I get, the more I think the value of these models is literally entirely contained in their graphic design.
