Um, ah, not that, ah, not that Im aware of, Miller told Woodward.I have not heard that theyre talking, so Id push back on that, Miller added.Woodward writes that Bidens Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines carefully hedged when asked about whether there were any post-presidency Trump-Putin calls.I would not purport to be aware of all contacts with Putin.

I can't find the particular article and I'll post a link if I do but I recall reading about the working conditions of this one Nevada brothel that was on HBO for a few years. It sounded kinda miserable: hard pushing quotas, putting customer satisfaction over employee comfort and safety (sometimes without proper compensation) and finally blackballing women who stand up for themselves.All in all, it's not so different from the kind of exploitation that anyone who's worked in food service or retail has suffered. The fact that it's sexual exploitation makes it especially heinous, however. The only way to avoid this sort of thing imo is to empower and protect self employed people in general, but that would arguably be an even harder sell to the government than prostitution.","title":"CMV: I think prostitution in the US should be legal and that democrats don't support it makes me realize they don't care about women freedom at all"},{"text":"And it didn't take an act of Congress.

For all intents and purposes, he's now a side character who has lived experiences the main characters aren't aware of. That is something that happens with every side character.And this illustrates a lot of problems with your view: in cases where some time is skipped, you would either have to assume that nothing of note happened during that time (which might be unrealistic and/or cause \\"rushed\\" development at the start of the movie) or tell the story of what happened during the timeskip, which is essentially just a different story than the one you're trying to tell. Alternatively, you could write their personality as unchangable, which greatly narrows down your creative freedom.Could it have been done better? Definitely. Is the concept itself bad? Not necessarily. There's ways to do it well and ways to do it badly, like with everything else related to media.

The second condition is the emergence of a hegemonic leader with the power to guide the establishment of a new?order. The third condition is that there has to be a big idea animating the need for?change.Since the beginning?of the 20th?century, there have been four critical junctures that met the first condition of redistributing state power: the First World War, the Second World?War,?the period of the oil and debt crises in the 1970s-80s, and finally the period?today.At the beginning of the 20th?century, the dominant big idea governing the international order was classical liberalism, shaped by Britain, the worlds leading economic?power.?This was when the world was on the Gold Standard. The First World War severely weakened Britain, and the United States at that point could have stepped into a global leadership role. It chose, however, not to do so when the Senate defied President Wilson and failed to ratify membership in the League of Nations.Without a global hegemon, the world fell into a chaotic?nationalism. The gold standard proved unable to deal with the global banking crisis in 1932-33, leading the new Roosevelt administration to pull out of the?system.?Economic nationalism gave way to political nationalism, and the Second World War was the?result. As a result, the Bretton Woods conference took place towards the end of that war, when it was increasingly clear that the Axis countries would be?defeated.? This led to the creation of modern institutions such as the International Monetary Fund to manage monetary policy and an International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the World Bank) to promote economic growth.While American hegemony eroded in the 70s and 80s with the rise of decolonization, non-aligned countries, and the OPEC Oil Embargo and spiral a of inflation in the United States, America nonetheless proved itself to be self-resilient, even more so after the fall of the Soviet Union.This newly resurgent America was animated by another big?idea.?It rejected embedded liberalism in favor of what has been labeled neoliberalism, which pushed the pendulum back in the direction of classical liberalism by seeking to remove the state from economic intervention to the extent?possible.?Washington exercised its newfound hegemonic power through the Bretton Woods institutions to push developing countries suffering from hyperinflation and currency crisis into structural?adjustment.**The rise of neoliberalism and the Washington Consensus had both good and bad?effects.**?Globalization and trade liberalization permitted developing countries like China, Vietnam, and India to enter the international trading system and achieve unprecedented rates of?growth.?On the other hand, the displacement of jobs from North America and Europe to East Asia laid the groundwork for a powerful political backlash in the?2010s. As a result, **this period of renewed U.S. hegemony lasted for approximately two decades, from the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 until roughly the subprime financial crisis in?2008.**Unfortunately, it was marred by two major mistakes in U.S. policy, which were underpinned in turn by two mistaken ideas that were derivative of the then-dominant?neoliberalism. The first was the 2003 invasion of Iraq, built on the belief that hard military power could be used to reshape the politics of a distant and culturally different part of the?world. The second big mistake was the promotion by the Bretton Woods institutions of capital mobility  that?is,?the ability of banks and other financial institutions to move large amounts of short-term money across international borders  as a key part of the Washington?Consensus.U.S. power has been in relative decline since its peak in?2008.?The American share of global output has been declining as a result of the rise of China and other East Asian?countries.?The United States has become a huge debtor country, with enormous pools of capital residing beyond its borders and outside its?control.?The American military, while still the worlds most powerful, is increasingly challenged by rising great powers Russia and China, as well as by new middle powers like the Gulf states, Turkey, and?others.?The American political model is no longer broadly imitated or even?admired.?Americas greatest global weakness is its internal polarization, which makes it difficult for Americans to agree on issues like aid to?Ukraine.?This then makes the U.S. model less attractive?internationally.?While the number of democracies around the world grew steadily from the mid-1970s to the first decade of the 21st?century, they have been in decline for nearly the past 20?years.(Cont)!ping HISTORY&amp;DEMOCRACY","title":"The Neoliberal World Order is Collapsing.

The announcement highlights an issue  safe drinking water  that Kamala Harris has prioritized as vice president and during her presidential campaign. The new rule supplants a looser standard set by former President Donald Trumps administration that did not include a universal requirement to replace lead pipes.Biden and Harris believe its a moral imperative to ensure that everyone has access to clean drinking water, EPA Administrator Michael Regan told reporters Monday. We know that over 9 million legacy lead pipes continue to deliver water to homes across our country. But the science has been clear for decades: There is no safe level of lead in our drinking water.''The rule is the strongest overhaul of lead-in-water standards in roughly three decades. Lead, a heavy metal used in pipes, paints, ammunition and many other products, is a neurotoxin that can cause a range of disorders from behavioral problems to brain damage. Lead lowers IQ scores in children, stunts their development and increases blood pressure in adults.The EPA estimates the stricter standard will prevent up to 900,000 infants from having low birthweight and avoid up to 1,500 premature deaths a year from heart disease.The new regulation is stricter than one proposed last fall and requires water systems to ensure that lead concentrations do not exceed an action level of 10 parts per billion, down from 15 parts per billion under the current standard. If high lead levels are found, water systems must inform the public about ways to protect their health, including the use of water filters, and take action to reduce lead exposure while concurrently working to replace all lead pipes.Lead pipes often impact low-income urban areas the most. They are most commonly found in older, industrial parts of the country, including major cities such as Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Detroit and Milwaukee, where Biden will announce the standards on Tuesday.The new rule also revises the way lead amounts are measured, which could significantly expand the number of cities and water systems that are found to have excessive levels of lead, the EPA said.To help communities comply, the agency is making available an additional $2.6 billion for drinking water infrastructure through the bipartisan infrastructure law. The agency also is awarding $35 million in competitive grants for programs to reduce lead in drinking water.The 10-year timeframe won't start for three years, giving water utilities time to prepare. A limited number of cities with large volumes of lead pipes may be given a longer timeframe to meet the new standard.Biden will make the announcement in Milwaukee, a city with the fifth-highest number of lead pipes in the nation, according to the EPA. Officials there are using money from the federal infrastructure law to accelerate lead-pipe replacement work and meet a goal to remove all lead pipes within 10 years, down from an initial 60-year timeframe.","title":"Biden sets a 10-year deadline for US cities to replace lead pipes and make drinking water safer"},{"text":"It's a long ass article, but really worth it. A snippet:C Citing a Trump aide, Woodward reports that there have been maybe as many as seven calls between Trump and Putin since Trump left the White House in 2021. What Trump secretly sent to Putin The book also contains new details about Trumps relationship with the Russian president. In 2020, Woodward writes, Trump had secretly sent Putin a bunch of Abbott Point of Care Covid test machines for his personal use. During the height of the pandemic, Russia and the United States did exchange medical equipment such as ventilators. But Putin  who infamously isolated himself over fears of Covid  told Trump on a phone call to keep the delivery of the Abbott machines quiet, Woodward reports. Please dont tell anybody you sent these to me, Putin said to Trump, according to Woodward. I dont care, Trump replied. Fine. No, no, Putin said. I dont want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me. They dont care about me. Woodward writes that Trump has stayed in touch with Putin after leaving office. In one scene, Woodward recounts a moment at Mar-a-Lago where Trump tells a senior aide to leave the room so he could have what he said was a private phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to Trumps aide, there have been multiple phone calls between Trump and Putin, maybe as many as seven in the period since Trump left the White House in 2021, Woodward writes. Woodward asked Trump?aide Jason Miller whether Trump and Putin had spoken since he left the White House. Um, ah, not that, ah, not that Im aware of, Miller told Woodward. I have not heard that theyre talking, so Id push back on that, Miller added. Woodward writes that Bidens Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines carefully hedged when asked about whether there were any post-presidency Trump-Putin calls. I would not purport to be aware of all contacts with Putin. I wouldnt purport to speak to what President Trump may or may not have done, Haines said, according to Woodward. Trump is becoming more erratic Woodward also writes about Trumps decision to run for president again, including a series of conversations with his ally and golfing buddy, Sen. Lindsey Graham. Going to Mar-a-Lago is a little bit like going to North Korea, Graham said. Everybody stands up and claps every time Trump comes in. The South Carolina Republican is quoted as saying Biden won fair and square but that Trump doesnt like to hear that. Woodward goes on to describe Grahams attempts to give Trump campaign advice for 2024. Youve got a problem with moderate women, Graham told Trump after the midterms. The people that think that the earth is flat and we didnt go to the moon, youve got them. Let that go. Graham repeatedly urged Trump to move on from the 2020 election, telling him if he is reelected, then January 6 wont be your obituary. I gave a speech today and I only mentioned the 2020 election twice! Trump said to Graham a few days later, as if it?had shown maximum restraint, Woodward writes. As Trump framed his presidential campaign around fear, Woodward writes that Graham said of the former president: Trump is becoming more erratic. These court cases. I think they would rattle anybody.","title":"That son of a bitch: New Woodward book reveals candid behind-the-scenes conversations of Biden, Trump, Harris and Putin"},{"text":"Turn down the rhetoric.","title":"Trump Warns Its Very Dangerous For Kamala Harris Voters to Identify Themselves, Because Theyll Get Hurt"},{"text":"Its high time we review Musks status in this country.","title":"Elon Musk makes it clear hes got no regrets over Kamala Harris assassination post in Tucker Carlson interview"},{"text":"that's actually so they can redirect the blame.. they need to bleed extra to blame someone on the bleeding.","title":"\\"We didnt answer\\": DeSantis refuses to take calls from Kamala Harris as another hurricane looms"},{"text":"Hating trump doesn't make him less of a terrible person.

The time between when Bill Clinton banned semiautomatic weapons and George W Bush let that legislation lapse was a less violent period than now.It sounds like youre confusing the federal assault weapons ban with a semi-auto ban.??Those are not the same thing.??You could buy semi-autos under Clintons ban.??Banned rifles could not have 2 or more of the following features: An adjustable stock, a pistol grip, a flash hider, a bayonet mount, and accept attachment of a grenade launcher.Banned pistols could not have 2 or more of the following features:??Magazine that attaches outside the pistol grip, threaded barrels, barrel shroud, a manufactured weight of 50 ounces or more, or be a semi-automatic version of a fully automatic firearm.That last one is especially silly.??Think about it, if a semi-auto Uzi isnt anymore dangerous than a Glock, why ban itBecause the aesthetics are scaryIf youre going to ban something, at least ban it on features that make it tangibly more dangerous.??Not aesthetics or ergonomics like pistol grips and adjustable stocks.??God forbid a family have a rifle with an adjustable stock so that family members with different arm lengths can share itAlso, banning bayonet mountsHow many domestic robberies and murders involved bayonetsIm guessing close to nil.??So why ban it?It was poorly designed legislation to make people feel safer without actually making them safer.??All Im saying is we need better gun laws to protect our citizens []Sure, but what you described doesnt sound like that.","title":"Kamala Harris on 60 Minutes: Of course Ive fired my Glock"},{"text":"*wink wink, nudge nudge","title":"Elon Musk And Tucker Carlson Laugh Over Idea Of Kamala Harris Assassination"},{"text":"I'll actually add, any party out of power relies on a bad economic report to regain power.

I believe that the real issue here is that low skill, high wage jobs have been exported and offshore. Now those same people are stuck in a position of low wage low skill work. To add, we were sold a false narrative that college would lead to better careers and pay, yet those jobs are shrinking and dwindling; meanwhile, trade work remains stable and lucrative while being looked down on by Americans of every stratta.The real issue is that we have shipped all of our jobs over seas, over relied on service industries, which tend to fail when an economy is in decline, and over educated a massive portion of the population. The number of jobs for that level of education were artificially inflated by investor Capitol and government subsidies that have dried up causing a massive shrinkage of job availability in those sectors. What we are now seeing is the blowback from bullshitting our way through the last 40 years of our economy instead of ensuring the health of the nation over the health of corporate entities.I tend to lean rather right, but when it comes to the damage that the corporate class has wrought on the US economy, it is hard to defend a right wing stance without becoming relatively isolationist in ones argumentation.

Tim Walz 60 Minutes interview highlights"},{"text":"No worries, I think you make fair points and yeah I have kinda been arguing in a couple directions which might have been a bit unclear. Sounds like we do pretty much agree, I definitely think nationalism is still an immensely powerful force in the world that we basically have to all accept and utilise for now. I guess the reason I argue like this is, based on the original article, it seems to basically argue liberals should embrace nationalism by talking about waving flags or being positive about your country. This seems odd to me, because that definition of nationalism is so expansive it probably includes pretty much everyone except a very small minority of people who genuinely feel negative towards their own national identity. I think almost everyone has some pride in their national identity, even people like me who definitely don't identify as nationalist. On the other hand, 'nationalism' in common parlance seems to imply a lot more than that. So overall I'm just a little confused what the original argument really is. If it's that liberal politicians shouldn't shy away from flag-waving and presenting their own proud, positive liberal vision of the nation, I don't think in most countries they generally very much do, at least try to, which made me think well maybe everyone's talking about the more explicit, narrow ideology of nationalism.

Some people arent willing to give up things like that, as they may feel life isnt worth it if they cant go out and have fun. That really isnt a great indicator that the economy is strong. There are metrics such as credit card debt, which is insanely high right now, which can be an indicator of how well people are doing. Ive noticed some friends putting things on their credit cards like a meal at a restaurant or buying concert tickets with their credit cards. While I do think people exaggerate on how bad the economy is, it certainly isnt great. People will still go out and do things whether the economy is good or bad. Theyll live paycheck to paycheck or put it on their credit cards. Whether people are saving is a better indicator, and I really dont think people have much saved.

Still, I apologise.I'll just add as a final note that while I don't want to defend nationalism as an end in of itself, the reason why I felt the need to push back on your comments is because I feel like the ideas I mention don't fully reckon with either how powerful nationalism is or how much effort it took to develop and promote it. As you are no doubt aware, nationalism (at least, according to most authors) is a fairly recent 'invention'. It took literally multiple millennia to elevate people's imagination and loyalty from their kith and kin or their tribes to a higher 'community' like a nation. And it was a powerful idea that has literally reshaped the world, often in the most violent of ways.The reason I raise this is because I think that for us cosmopolitans, there is a sobering lesson there. Not just on the difficulty of 'dislodging' nationalism from the political imagination, but for developing a political community to replace it. Developing an 'imagined community' is hard - really friggin' hard. It is something that every political philosophy struggles with - not just nationalism, but even leftist ideologies like communism with their conception of 'class' and 'the people' or religions like Christianity and Islam with Christendom and the Ummah respectively. The fact that nations have proven so durable, outlasting other ideologies, with a lot of modern citizens seemingly willing to sacrifice democracy itself for vague ideas of 'national sovereignty' should give us pause - it gives me pause, at least.That's not to  argue against cosmopolitanism or for nationalism - again, I am the former and not the latter. But to argue for some caution. Cosmopolitanism argues for an 'imagined community' larger than any other ideology - humanity itself. A laudable goal, but extremely ambitious. I don't expect it to be easier to forge this community than any other imagined community was, and I don't expect it to come with any less turmoil or disruption.Anyway, yeah, that's my TedTalk, lol. Sorry for the essay. Just that your response/clarification triggered some longstanding concerns and anxieties I've been having. In either case, again, sorry for the earlier condescension.","title":"The Power of Liberal Nationalism C \\"If they are to successfully defend democracy in multiethnic societies, liberals must stop conflating nationalism with nativism and ethnonationalism, seize the flag, and arm themselves with emotionally compelling national-democratic narratives.\\""},{"text":"https://youtu.be/SiBFtwbyv44\\nYou need to watch this if youre interested in this avenue.","title":"Kamala's Harris's mother was part of the MK-ULTRA program"},{"text":"I'm a member of the John Brown Gun Club, and I voted for Kamala.

Then they started tallying mail-in ballots, and the mail-in ballots skewed very, very heavily towards Biden.Trump knew in advance that this would happen.  He similarly knew that in places like Ohio, where early votes were counted first, that the results would look good for Biden for a bit, and then shift to Trump.Analysists/pundits talked about that this would happen well before the election.  Trump had discouraged absentee voting, despite voting by absentee ballot himself.States that counted early votes and absentee votes starting before polls closed saw democrats have a lead that then shrank and reverse (e.g. Ohio).  States that counted early votes last saw the opposite effect.There is a recording of Roger Stone talking about how conservatives could exploit the difference between early counted votes and late counted votes to raise doubts about the election if they lost.  This wasn't a case of genuine confusion.many people were genuinely convinced by Trump's campaign and conservative media to genuinely believe the election was rigged.   But, the Trump campaign and the conservative media knew what they were peddling.

Simply the idea that the state should be based on a self-defined characteristic, and that laws and such should be exclusive to that 'nation' that you identify with, it's just fundamentally morally wrong to me. In a perfect moral world, there would be no such thing as nation-states, because the rights of all people would be protected under an overarching legal and political system. I don't think it's something that I, as a liberal, can ever support or integrate into my ideological worldview.Of course, as I said elsewhere, I'm not naive and think it's feasible to just tell everyone to stop being nationalists. In real life politics, of course people should use nationalism if it's useful to their goals.

The closest they have is a few 7-Elevens, and even those arent plentiful down there.When I lived in a small town, literally the only store even pretending to be a grocery store within 40 miles was a single Walmart. All of the other stores had been run out of business.Its really hard to boycott the one store within reasonable distance of your house even though they keep raising prices on virtually everything. And given the consolidation of grocery store brands in the United States in the past 20 years, thats getting worse.Old man yells at cloud portion of message begins here:When I was younger, there were 15 or so different grocery store chains in the area. Now there are four, not counting bougie/boutique stores like Trader Joes, sprouts, and Whole Foods (since those are only in the rich neighborhoods anyway), and one of them just took over another as Safeway/Tom Thumb is merging with Albertsons. I miss having the choice of where I wanted to shop. It kept prices lower because they knew customers could go a mile away to a different store and save $20-$30.","title":"Warren and Dean demand Coke, Pepsi and General Mills stop shrinkflation | Inflation"},{"text":"and she goes to jail in US for that crime, doesnt matter if she has a foreign prescription.","title":"Remember when Biden-Harris freed the Merchant of Death (Viktor Bout) for the WNBA player, Griner?

There was a lot of contentious stuff going on. If you watched the election results roll in, the night of the election it looked like Trump had things locked in. Then they started tallying mail-in ballots, and the mail-in ballots skewed very, very heavily towards Biden. There were allegations that state election officials were adding in as many fake mail-in ballots as they needed to lock in a Biden win. There were allegations that \\"ballot harvesters\\" took mail-in ballots from people and only turned in the ones filled out for Biden.Now personally, I don't think these things happened - at least not on a large enough scale to have tipped the election outcome. But I do think Trump genuinely believed that they happened. Try to put yourself in Trump's shoes for a second. If the election actually had been rigged, was what he did unreasonable? If you think it would be okay if the election had actually been rigged, then could you forgive someone who genuinely believed it but got it wrong for acting the way Trump did?Try to think about it absent all the baggage you already have about Trump. Presumably you don't like his politics anyway. If some candidate you liked pretty well genuinely seemed to believe that an already pretty weird looking election had been stolen from them and responded as Trump did, would you consider voting for them again in a subsequent election?","title":"CMV: I am a legal Immigrant to the US, can't fathom voting for Trump for undermining democracy and hence the American dream.

But they still support the person who implements those policies.   They admit to \\"lowering taxes\\".  They even say they want to lower taxes on the middle and lower class.  Yet that never happens.  Its always breaks to the upper elite ie billionaires and megacorporations.  How do I know?  Because thats all Trump did during his presidency.  He didnt lower taxes on the middle and lower classes.  He only lowered taxes and gave tax breaks to the super wealthy.  If you need even more proof read [this](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/the-2017-trump-tax-law-was-skewed-to-the-rich-expensive-and-failed-to-deliver) website.  Its trickle down economics at its very basics.  The ultra wealthy get tax breaks that never \\"trickle down\\" to the bottom half. One of my favorite quotes from the page. \\"*New research shows that workers who earned less than about $114,000 on average in 2016 saw no change in earnings from the corporate tax rate cut, while top executive salaries increased sharply.*  That salary is of 114k is still very high even where we live where the median salary is 100k.  That was also in 2016 til now money.  Its probably even worse at this point.  Just because Republicans wont admit to supporting it they implement it with impish glee because it benefits them.  Republicans almost always say something to the public then do the exact opposite to whatever benefits them.Its like when they tried and failed to repeal Obamacare.  In Kentucky they never called Obamacare what it was.  It was called something else. This was all in an effort to get people to agree with repealing it without realizing they would be losing their healthcare. Over 70% of its constituents were using Obamacare.  Their representative, Mitch McConnell, was on the forefront of trying to strip it away.  He was willing to let 70% of his state on Obamacare go WITHOUT health insurance just to stick it to the Democrats without a single plan to replace it. And I guess it was just coincidence that all of his rich real estate friends got the bids on those contracts and built high rises there?   I wasnt born yesterday.  Trump touted as him \\"saving\\" these Democratic cities by building opportunity zones there for low income housing only they werent low income housing AT ALL.  Its all in a concerted effort to gentrify these low income areas.  They are pricing people out of their homes and into the streets.  I guess people are good enough to work in these areas but they would have to trave an hour or more from where they live just to work because they could only dream of living in a place like that.  WHY else would you build luxury high rises in low income areas where you KNOW the people living there cant afford them?  They were just a way to give Trump's real estate friends a discount on the government's dime to build more luxury high rises.","title":"CMV: Elon Musk speaking at a Trump Rally in PA is the greatest gift you could possibly give to the Democratic Party."},{"text":"Try any Econ 101 textbook.Immigrants are more than just demand.

As district attorney in San Francisco, she took a tough stance on big issues like human trafficking and violent crime, which earned her a lot of support. Sure, some people criticized the number of marijuana convictions under her watch. Still, she was working within the laws of the time, and its important to note that she also implemented programs like Back on Track to give first-time offenders a second chance. So, she wasnt just about locking people up; she was trying to help low-level offenders turn their lives around.When she became Attorney General, her focus on protecting consumers resonated with many people, especially during the foreclosure crisis. She went after big corporations and secured settlements to help homeowners, a big win for many Californians. She also defended the Affordable Care Act, which showed she was thinking about the bigger picture regarding peoples health and well-being. Yes, some progressives wanted her to push harder on criminal justice reform. Still, she was generally seen as working for the people and trying to balance many competing priorities.So, overall, I think Kamala did well in her law enforcement roles. She enforced the laws as needed but also tried to offer alternatives like diversion programs. She wasnt afraid to take on significant issues or big companies, and her ability to adapt to the challenges of the time shows why she maintained a lot of support throughout her career in California.","title":"Kamala Harris 60 Minutes interview: she was disarmingly human"},{"text":"[Biden sets a 10-year deadline for US cities to replace lead pipes and make drinking water safer](https://apnews.com/article/lead-pipes-epa-flint-biden-wisconsin-4aae63134894762cbe904ee460e62708)[Kamala Harris during a Tuesday appearance on The View is expected to announce a new policy aimed at helping families care for aging seniors.

Something extremely destructive, difficult to go out of, which isn't completely your fault because it's a disease, but is completely your responsibility because you hurt the people around you and it's your job, and your job alone, to stop. Tons of people have extremely boring lives and are unsatisfied, for lots of reasons. Not all of them are poor, by far, poverty isn't the only source of unsatisfaction. But most of them have only few interesting things to do. Men in particular, who have never been taught how to manage their emotions and insecurities. Boomers who feel lost in a technological world, who have a hard time connecting with their kids, and with a more open, less hierarchical, society. They were the shit when they worked, people asked them to help, they were someone. These days they can't open a pdf and no one is asking them anything, if anything young pepople are laughing at them. And thye're bored, they're bored to hell, because they bought everything  they could need and don't feel excitement from it anymore. So the only excitement they get in their day is when they get angry at whatever new conspiracy Fox/Newsmax/the GOP is pushing. They need their daily fix of infuriating TV, it's their drug of choice. Anger is the last feeling they have left. Not love, not empathy, anger. Anger is a very powerful motivator, it's easy to choose, and when anger is the only thing carrying you, you can't stop, or you deflate completely.

The grocery store will absolutely pass any increase on their cost for product to the customer immediately, but they also up the price independently to deal with their own other costs (though sometimes they do have contracts to sell at specific price ranges, depends on the item and manufacturer).Trying to pass a law to stop it just removes it as an option leaving the only alternative being a price increase at the manufacturer level.

I think given that, mass shootings is all you reasonably can avoid. Even if we could agree that we should ban all guns, which isn't politically viable at this point, if someone is sufficiently motivated and willing to suffer the consequences, they're probably going to take down their target and maybe someone else. You don't even need a gun for that, a knife is typically enough if you can catch the person off-guard and we can't ban the sale of all knives. I think it comes down to the destructive potential and not having people arming themselves to a point where even law enforcement might struggle to intervene. I'm not a firearms expert but there are a number of factors that go into that, the size and velocity of the bullet, how many rounds can be fired per second, whether there is a semi-auto or burst fire, how quickly the gun can be reloaded, etc. and you have to look at all those factors and weigh them against our right to have some level of protection.   \\n  \\nThe problem is the people that want to keep these more powerful weapon in circulation aren't thinking about protecting their homes and families but their fantasies about fending off the government and if you pretend that's a viable option then you're going to need machine guns and RPGs.

With weed the only victims are on the consumer side. There is no shortcomings of legal supply. Legal supply can scale and keep up with demand without issues. The drug addict would be the equivalent to a sex addict that spends all their money on legal prostitutes. Which isn't really an argument that holds up.I can agree that the status quo isn't the best solution. And facing reality is important. But legalization basically is saying that we are fine with exploiting people as long as they would have it worse elsewhere. Which could then also be extended to slavery. I am sure if slavery is regulated well enough, a slave in the US will have a better life than in many other places on earth. But I hope we can all agree that that isn't something we should encourage.I think I failed to provide the alternative to legaliziation in my first post. Which is decriminalization. Decriminalization might not provide the same benefits to sex workers but also doesn't cause as many drawbacks.Prostitution is legal in Nevada and while some sex workers say this was the right decision and it worked out for them. There are many more who heavily critize the system and would have prefered decriminalization. And the same happens in any country with legal prostitution.The brothel house system is terrible. If sex workers are only allowed to offer their services in licensed brothels you create a system that's ripe for financial exploitation. Brothel owners might not use physical violence but that's all that seperates them from pimps. They charge ridiculous high fees, enforce terrible working conditions, and the sex workers themselves have no option but to go along with it because if the brothel doesn't let them work there anymore, they can only resort again to unlicensed sex work.Legal registered sex work creates a permanet record which can lead to discrimination down the line. We already see how people lose their job and have difficulties finding a job if their OF profile is discovered. With straight up porn it's even more difficult. Now imagine the amount of discrimination women with prostitution on their background check have to face.While the mandatory health check ups of legal prostitution help preventing the spread of stds to customers, it doesn't help prevent the sex workers from catching it. So we protecting the people who take advantage of people in need, while the people in need themselves don't really see the benefit.With decriminalization sex workers keep full autonomy on how, when, and where they offer their service. They have an easier time to get out of the system without leaving a record. And there is no middle man that cuts into their profit. There is no need for organized crime protecting from the police, so pimps will also decline.","title":"CMV: I think prostitution in the US should be legal and that democrats don't support it makes me realize they don't care about women freedom at all"},{"text":"That's because Haryana is a multi-party battle with bjp,inc,inld,JJP,bsp, indipendents etc etc so many It becomes bi-polar in lok sabha elections tho.Edit: bjp overtakes congress in vote share","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Causally drop Trevor Lawrence in there ??","title":"Remember when Biden-Harris freed the Merchant of Death (Viktor Bout) for the WNBA player, Griner?

For the U.S. semiconductor industry to flourish in the long-term, it must be able to develop innovative and commercially competitive technologies to sustainably produce materials and manufacture chips in a way that protects the environment and local communities.To accomplish this, CHIPS for America anticipates up to $100 million in funding to award recipients that develop university-led, industry-informed, collaborations about artificial intelligence-powered autonomous experimentation (AI/AE) relevant to sustainable semiconductor manufacturing.  \\n...  \\nAI/AE has emerged as a potentially game-changing approach to accelerating materials research and development. AI/AE combines automated synthesis and characterization tools with an AI planner to determine the next round of an experimental campaign, vastly accelerating the design of new materials and the acquisition of materials data. In enabling federated research across multiple locations, AI/AE can create opportunities for collaborations across established research universities, emerging research institutions, industry, and national laboratories.CHIPS for America C with its programs spanning manufacturing incentives and multiple areas of research and development C is uniquely positioned to work with stakeholders across federal, state, and local government, industry, academia and research institutions, labor unions, and environmental groups to investigate, commercialize, and advance solutions in this space. Addressing sustainability challenges also presents an opportunity to better engage universities, including emerging research institutions, to conduct high-impact semiconductor R&amp;D and to grow semiconductor research talent.  \\n...  \\nThrough this anticipated funding opportunity, CHIPS for America will support the sustainability of the U.S. semiconductor industry while recognizing the ongoing demand for improving microelectronics power, performance, area, and cost metrics. The competition will also aim to expand the participation of universities, including emerging research institutions, and their graduates in the semiconductor research and development (R&amp;D) ecosystem. The notice of funding opportunity is expected to be released later this year.Statement from U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo:Right now, new semiconductor materials often take years to be production-ready and are incredibly resource-intensive. If were going to quickly build up Americas semiconductor manufacturing base, in a way thats sustainable over the long term in the face of increasing threats from the climate crisis, we need to leverage AI to help develop sustainable material processes quickly. With this new program, the Biden-Harris Administration will harness the vast capabilities of AI to unleash the full potential of our workers and innovators, while building a more secure and enduring domestic semiconductor industry, said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration to Invest up to $100 Million to Accelerate R&amp;D and AI Technologies for Sustainable Semiconductor Materials"},{"text":"Indeed friend!","title":"Hurricane Milton, Trump, &amp; Devils Advocate"},{"text":"Harris is trying to go get that Hurricane Sandy boost.","title":"Ron DeSantis Isnt Taking Calls from Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Someone gets me :)","title":"Hurricane Milton, Trump, &amp; Devils Advocate"},{"text":"The main difference is, the stuff they \\"have\\" on Harris is only made up bullshit.

In full context, he was referring to the economic repercussions of outsourcing car manufacturing jobs to Mexico. Basically, Americans would lose jobs and the U.S. wouldn't be able to compete due to undercutting. They would go out of business. Here is the full quote:\\"Those big monster car manufacturing plants that youre building in Mexico right now, and you think youre going to get that, youre going to not hire Americans, and youre going to sell the cars to us? No. Were going to put a 100% tariff on every single car that comes across the line, and youre not going to be able to sell those cars. If I get elected. Now, if I dont get elected, its going to be a bloodbath, for the whole  thats going to be the least of it. Its going to be a bloodbath for the country. Thatll be the least of it. But theyre not going to sell those cars.\\"Media outlets are saying that he is calling for a violent bloodbath if he loses the election. For example, NBC - \\"Trump says there will be a bloodbath if he loses the election.\\" However if you read the quote, you can see that this has absolutely zero to do with what he said. I would actually consider this article to be a threat to democracy via intentional manipulation of the public to make an informed vote. It's important to note that both sides do this. But in my opinion, the left is worse in this regard because they tend to link what he says to violence. For example, calling him a stalin/hitler when this is not true. If you call a man hitler in a country of 330 mil Americans, there will be a few knuckleheads out there who will actually believe this and think to themselves, \\"well, i guess i better be a hero and kill hitler!\\"With regards to the dictator stuff, think about it like this. Imagine someone says \\"Well, if being a killer means protecting my family from a home invader, then I guess I'm a killer.\\" I think most people would think this is justified. Now imagine the next day, the legacy media header is something like \\"deranged man says he would kill.\\" At this point, the media is framing him as being a threat by way of omitting important context. Most Americans don't have the time to do proper research on this so I don't blame them, and legacy media knows this, so they take advantage of this. That's where it's on us to think more critically.

Proximity to an illegal act still puts one in a highly stigmatized position, like being unable to name your current job on job/loan applications for reasonable fear of likely discrimination. \\n  \\nIt just seems criminalization in whatever form wouldnt prevent that inherent coercion, but can add to the vulnerability/danger of sex work. Choosing to make something even worse in practice because you think its inherently bad doesnt really make sense to me.","title":"CMV: I think prostitution in the US should be legal and that democrats don't support it makes me realize they don't care about women freedom at all"},{"text":"Please, tell me about the outsized influence of social media in the 2012 elections.

Sex is an intimate act between two people. For both men and women. Having sex with someone should not be a job. It should be done because you care about the person or love the person or want to date the person. Independence is important and people should be allowed to make their own choices. But if prostitution is legalized as a job, then what about say child labor. They are 'independently' making the choice to work. Does that mean it should be acceptable? What if I tell someone consensually that I want them to hurt/kill me and I will pay them for doing that. Should that be acceptable legally? Also sometimes people make choices because they don't have any better option. For a lot of prostitutes or sex workers they are doing it because they need the money. If they got even a job that payed less but they did not have to have sex with people then they would take it. Because they don't really want to do it.

Most who do want that kind of work already resort to escorting instead, which is legal in the US. Legalization doesn't increase the supply of \\"domestic\\" prostitutes. In Germany for example, only 16% of registered prostitutes have German citizenship. in Austria 3% are Austrian citizens, in the Netherland the number of foreign prostitutes is estimated to be somewhere between 60-85%.So mostly what legalization does is legalize a market to exploit foreign women from poor countries. They are not becoming a prostitute because they want to but out of financial needs. That isn't a good thing to promote. I do not think anyone should be forced into prostitution because it's their only method of earning money. That's also why the number of domestic prostitutes in these European countries is so low, because there is a decent social securty system in place that catches most. So your argument of \\"legalization is liberating\\" idoesn't really hold up.Unfortunately many women from poor countries will find themselves in the same situation whether prostitution is legal or not.  Now we are left with trying to find the solution of which helps those unfortunate people the most. And that's where data becomes insufficient.Some studies suggest that legalization of prostitution actually increases sex trafficing victims. That's because demand for sex workers increases while the supply stays the same. So more women are brought in from abroad, maybe not in the sense of being kidnapped and forced into sex work but in the form of coming to the country under false promises and then finding them in a situation where getting out would be very costly to them. They technically can leave and not engage in prostitution so everything is \\"legal\\" but they would find themselves or their family members in financial ruin.Many people who resort to prostitution to make ends meet also don't have the resources to actually become legal anyhow. They don't have cash to register their business, pay for licenses, or whatnot. And since their only reason for doing that kind of work is to make enough money to survive, paying taxes hurts extra. That's why plenty of sex workers themselves prefer decriminialization over legalization. It allows them the freedom to operate how they want to. And even in a legalized country, they will often find themselves outside the system anyhow.Yes, heath generally improves for legal prostitutes. Mandatory checkups certainly helps but more importanlty access to health care plays a role in that. So the answer to increasing health might not be to legalize prostitution but rather to just give people access to free health care. Any legal prostitute who finds herself with an STD won't just stop being a prostitute, she would just become unlicensed anyhow. Because again, almost certainly she isn't a prostitute because she wants to but because it's the only way to make enough money.Why actual data is difficult to come by can be explained because there is very little standardized tracking going on. Even in many countries with legal prostitution the laws vary a lot by muncipiality. In Australia for example, in one state only escorts are legal, in another every form except escorting is legal, and in another all kinds are legal. So any data from Australia is pointless since it has a mixed form of prostitution and you would need to look at individual state levels. And in some countries it even depends from city to city. Where both, the laws may differ but also the enfrocement.I can't say for sure that legalization is the wrong step. But it certainly isn't a case of \\"the us is just backwards\\". There are points towards keeping it illegal or maybe to just decriminalize it rather than legalizing it. As legalization can come with drawbacks that might outweigh the positives.","title":"CMV: I think prostitution in the US should be legal and that democrats don't support it makes me realize they don't care about women freedom at all"},{"text":"The vote shares are very close.

Mostly there are addicted to porn and not capable to approach a woman. This create loners, gooners and incels. They praised sex as the main goal in life but it isnt.I actually believe that prostitution should be legal but this is utterly baseless. Having incel beliefs and behaviors isn't a symptom of not having sex, it's a symptom of misogyny. Having sex with a woman may definitionally end a man's inceldom, but it won't end that man's misogyny any more than Thomas Jefferson having sex with his slaves cured his racism.By giving them the opportunity of experience it, they will understand and focus on get it by their own way.They will not.

I guarantee that incels would become a terror to those women.But there women that dont because there are more liberal or saw as a way to get easy money. Why impeding them to do that. We are in a more free world where women can decide upon herself.Do you think that the government restricts opiate use because they don't respect the freedom of chronic pain sufferers? Also, you seem to be under the impression that liberals are more prostitute adjacent and conservatives are less so, but it can be a lot more complex than that.

Losing two to five percentage points in a tight race because a candidate wanted to legalize something that 9/10ths of his constituents either don't care about or associate with human trafficking is a risk no rational politician would take.If prostitution is ever legalized in America, it will be like weed and gambling: a very moderate rollout in select cities/Indian territories that slowly expands as people see first hand that it didn't collapse society and is quite profitable until it becomes simply too big to deny.","title":"CMV: I think prostitution in the US should be legal and that democrats don't support it makes me realize they don't care about women freedom at all"},{"text":"but then you're _in Chicago_, so - probably not worth it","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"keep on bein awesome.

And, Arizona wants to fix the problem.  So, anyone who votes who isn't a citizen runs a significant risk of getting caught as Arizona fixes up their records and then charged with a felony.Arizona just doesn't have enough time to fix the database before the election without disenfranchising some US citizens who are eligible to vote.","title":"CMV: I am a legal Immigrant to the US, can't fathom voting for Trump for undermining democracy and hence the American dream.

Every election, both sides have an army of lawyers ready to challenge the results in the courts and capitals of close states, and delay certification while court cases are still ongoing. Gore did the same thing in 2000, and it took the Supreme Court to force an end to the legal process. What happened Jan. 6th was a political rally that got out of control. There was never any 'threat to democracy', as all proper proceedures were going to be followed to move to the next President. People breaking windows doesn't affect this. More toward your question:I don't know what the American Dream means to you. But if it is to enjoy being in a country where the government is truly 'by the people, for the people' then I believe the party that most respects the principals of our Founding Fathers is the best. The Constitution and The Bill of Rights are important in keeping our country centered on the freedom of its people. Democrats have often expressed disdain for the Bill of Rights, as it limits the power of government. Many Democrats have spoken out against Free Speech and Freedom of the Press. The Biden/Harris administration has funded many efforts to increase censorship. Democrats want to tear down the institution of the Supreme Court, threatening to pack it with Democrat Justices and place Justices under constant review through nebulous tax and ethics rules. This goes against the Founders bedrock principal of Seperation of Powers. And Democrats want to get rid of the Electoral College, which was a compromise between large and small states that was necessary to form this country. And, of course, the 2nd amendment has also been under attack by Democrats. Also they have been weaponizing the Justice system to bring politically targeted prosecutions against political opponents. It is clear to me which party is actually undermining our democracy.","title":"CMV: I am a legal Immigrant to the US, can't fathom voting for Trump for undermining democracy and hence the American dream.

If these jobs are legal that puts pressure on them to do it even if they'd really rather not. If prostitution is legal and just treated like any other job it would also mean that people could have unemployment benefit removed if they do not become prostitutes, literally forcing people into it. Unemployment benefit relies on the job seeker looking for work. It differs by state but it's not unusual for turning down jobs that you are qualified for to be grounds for having your benefits removed.As soon as you make it legal without also instituting something like UBI, there are people who are going to be going into prostitution who dislike it a lot but need to pay the bills.

Trump also did not order the deployment of the National Guard, and he did not attempt to work with the Justice Department to deploy law enforcement personnel.

America has a history of recounts and contested elections. In my life alone I can remember several. We had the whole hanging chad business with the Bush/Gore race. And the fact that Trump can stand up and say hang on this should be looked at is important to maintaining that freedom. If he did not stand up and call it into question then no investigation would ever be done to eliminate the question of if it was rigged. If he was actually going to undermine democracy it would be a coup. For all his complaining he still handed over the presidency and we moved forward. Having said that. Voter fraud happens in every election. How much is questionable. But it comes out in almost every election that at least some place there was fraud. The real question is how much fraud and did it affect the election. I will also say we have some fairly insecure elections relative to many other places in the world. My wife for instance is from the Dominican Republic. She has been an American citizen now nearly 20 years, and she did it legally. In her home land they check ID agents a list. Can prevent you from voting if you don't look like the photo on your ID (not just a weight change, like photo is a black dude and your a white chick). And when you have cast your vote they dip your finger in dye that does not wash off for a couple days to prevent you from voting at another poll. Frankly I love that, and I think we should be doing it here to take away a lot of the questions about fraud. To her it is important because of the history of corruption and BS in her home land. They were not allowed to question it, and only violence changed things initially.","title":"CMV: I am a legal Immigrant to the US, can't fathom voting for Trump for undermining democracy and hence the American dream.

Since 2012, in contrast, she has reported almost no gifts. Some of the items she listed in her early years sound worthy of a modern art gallery. In 2011, she received a translucent composite print, apparently by the California photographer Robert Weingarten, worth $6,000. In 2010, she received an Einstein sculpture, by the artist Robert Berks, worth $1,500. And in 2009, she received a watercolor painting of three owls, worth $1,125.By far the largest gift that any justice has disclosed over the past two decades is a $1 million prize that Ginsburg won in 2019, a year before she died. The Berggruen Institute, a California think tank founded by billionaire investor Nicolas Berggruen,?awarded Ginsburg its annual prize for culture and philosophy. Ginsburg reported giving the money to unspecified charities.Ginsburg also reported other valuable gifts that did not go to charity. In 2018, she amended a disclosure form to reflect her receipt of an opera costume, valued at $4,500, from her?non-singing performance?in the Washington National Operas production of The Daughter of the Regiment. Ginsburg also once reported a gift bag worth $2,500 that she received in connection with being named one of Glamour magazines Women of the Year.Looks like Kagan is the one hero in supreme court history.

Chances are they'd never be down with it. And they're not the only ones from a religious perspective.In my opinion, it is something that should be left to the states but even then I doubt it'd make any headway. America has an odd way of stigmatizing sex in comparison to other countries. Personally, I don't have much problem with it as long as there's consent involved and they're of legal age. We're already pushing OnlyFans everywhere. But I do recognize that it can definitely be exploited for other more malicious purposes and I think that's also another factor as to its legality being pushed. Anyone who does do sex work though, regardless, has to be okay with the potential consequences which can be both brutal (physically and mentally) as well as extremely limiting their career paths permanently due to stigma.","title":"CMV: I think prostitution in the US should be legal and that democrats don't support it makes me realize they don't care about women freedom at all"},{"text":"Still, sometimes you don't need to shoot intruders.

It is an organization of gun runners who protect the rights and profitability of gun sellers. Theyve put many Americans at risk with their advocacy against common sense gun reform. Not everyone who wields a gun is a danger to society, but we have enough gun violence in the United States that shows our current legislation to be inadequate. The time between when Bill Clinton banned semiautomatic weapons and George W Bush let that legislation lapse was a less violent period than now. All Im saying is we need better gun laws to protect our citizens and I dont see the need for semiautomatic weapons at all other than people get pleasure owning and firing them which wasnt the intent of the second amendment in the first place.

I liked Gillibrand, Gabbard and Yang, personally.Here's a nice little peek at the candidate polling during that time, week by week until nomination:[https://www.politico.com/2020-election/democratic-presidential-candidates/polls/](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/democratic-presidential-candidates/polls/)So, what did everybody get as the end result?  A career politician getting his reward for his years of service and allegiance to an agenda, by a conglomerate of other powerful career politicians on that side of the two winged bird, regardless of declining cognizance, in a partnership with the MSM to conceal this decline.Mr. Biden said he would be picking a Vice-POTUS that would be \\"representative\\" rather than by merit, ability or capability.  He picked Ms. Harris (or, should I say, the left wing of the bird's pick).Ms. Harris was holding an office that doesn't have a lot of authority or responsibility unless all of a sudden it has all of the authority and responsibility.  Sure, that office is the \\"President\\" of the Senate, casting tiebreaking votes when necessary. And that does hold importance.But, when the secret of Mr. Biden's decline got a bit too difficult to conceal anymore, and rumors really started to look like truths, to hold power, the left wing of the bird went to work to position themselves to hold on to that power.Problem is, they picked wrong.  They had to pick soon enough to put on their Convention and publish the appearance of solidarity, and I'm pretty sure that the lady who told the story of the guy who fought segregation on the debate stage from when she was a kid, not really appearing to be a close personal friend at any point in time during the primary season, wasn't going to go down easy.  She had been part of the gatekeeping of the secrets for 3+ years!But, thrust onto the stage to chase the big chair, the same person who dropped out of the race early now has to be propped up by MSM.  And, when you got guys like Markie Mark and his social media platform saying they're not really willing to help as much this time around during a congressional hearing, and the RocketMan buying another major social media platform and saying he ain't playing either, all of a sudden, there becomes a decent chance that the right side of that two winged bird may take over.  The MSM is a business.  A conglomerate.  Their executives make really good money.  And, ever since Mr. Trump came on the scene, he's been chipping away at them with the ultimate two words that ring a bit too true:  \\"Fake News\\".If these execs want to keep their lucrative salaries and have enough audience to garner enough advertising to keep the money flowing, they can only pretend to be news journalists and not propaganda agents for so long.  If the momentum shifts as much as I believe it has, they're stuck now having to pretend NOT to be propaganda agents and get their asses back towards actual journalism.  And that move, in and of itself, is not conducive to propping up Ms. Harris and her shortcomings.","title":"Trump or Kamala, going to put on my tin foil hat for a se..."},{"text":"No I was just giving you more quotes since you want proof.

This however goes against the heart of the first amendment, but Hilary is not wrong that these platforms are causing a lot of harm. The question is who, or in this case what, is actually causing said harm and there seems to be a very clear answer to that conundrum, which is bots. For the most part the vast majority of harm caused by these platforms is of non-human origin, or at the very least is amplified by non-human affiliates. What Harari (and Ill say that while I dont agree with everything he says, I do think hes at least trying to be on the right side of things) suggests is that we do hold these platforms responsible, but only for content originated and amplified by bots. This way, no humans first amendment rights are being taken away.

Inflation is only a serious problem when it increases at a higher rate than wages, which is what happened as a result of Trump's insanely incompetent handling of the pandemic. It's insane that Biden gets any blame for inflation when it immediately went up right after Trump left but I guess I understand that many Americans don't understand economics at all. Inflation destroys price systems. If you can't effectively predict prices, you can't take informed market decisions. That's freaking basic. Imagine you have a construction company and want to take a 100+ stories building project, how are you going to effectively calculate the cost of the steel and concrete you'd need in 4 years when you're 2/3 into the project? Countries with high inflation, like Argentina, effectively address this by simply dollarizing capital spending and saving, and usually overstock during devaluations. What alternative do U.S. companies have? Bitcoin? Yen? Gold? Because no stock or bill will guarantee value-against-inflation with low risk in an inflationary economy. Even then, if we were to accept your oblivious take, how come Venezuela, Argentina and Lebanon don't become industrial powerhouses?

We have to look at countries that adopted reasonable policies and see how they did. IMO, the countries with the most reasonable policies for covid were Nordic countries. Switzerland, for example. Switzerland had an inflation rate of 0 to 3% from 2020 until today. And how did Switzerland handle covid? No lock downs. No child masking. They banned the Moderna vaccination when they saw increased myocarditis risks. They did not recommend the booster except for high-risk populations (65+ and immunocomprimised people). Their death rates were not worse. This is what I would call following the science. USA did not follow science. Almost every decision we made had no data or refuting data (lock downs, cloth masks, hand washing, boosters for young healthy people, Moderna on young men). So yes I absolutely blame leadership here.

For criticizing his writing yours is kind of egotistical and off putting. he has the balls to speak on the Palestine Israel conflict.And why should he avoid this topic? Why should anyone? Are you claiming the only people who get to have an opinion are Jews or Arabs? I would argue that any American has a right to put in their perspective because of how much money we send Israel.Coates seems to delude himself into thinking his experience as a black man and a brief tour organized by Palestinian activists gives him the right to lecture Israel on its right to exist or how it needs to reshape its society.You don't need a tour to see the blatant racism that permeates Israeli society. I would argue that he would have some measure of perspective on institutionalized systems of discrimination considering the long and storied history of bureaucratic racism in the US. Something he would surely never grant an outsider coming into his community.Do you want to tour black neighborhoods and offer your take on systemic racism? I don't think he is the arbiter of who is allowed to speak on the issue. Im afraid any insight you offer on the subject would be seen as racist though, and not for the reason you might think. He constantly makes the comparison to South Africa and Jim Crow and yet never once speaks to any of the Arab Jews in Israel whose sole reason for being their is their own expulsion from various Muslims nations in the Middle East about what they think of Israel.What does this have to do with the points he is making? Does the fact that Jews were driven from Arab regions change the fact that Israel not only expelled hundreds of thousands of Palestinians but also maintains an apartheid regime in the occupied West Bank? Is it not factual that there are roads that Palestinians can't use and places they are not allowed to go? Is it not factual that Israel maintains illegal settlements and walls off Palestinians in quisling bantustans? Which is funny because Im sure theyre plenty dark enough for Coates to trust them over a white, European looking Jew.I find this to be racist. Which is kind of ironic because you are complaining about him being one. He never asks why you can find Arabs parties in the Knesset but no Jewish parties anywhere else in the Muslim world.You fail to mention that they are not equal citizens in Israel, sure they can vote but they do in fact face many forms of institutionalized segregation and discrimination. More damningly, he never interrogates why the only Jewish nation in existence is a problem but the numerous explicitly Muslim (most of the Middle East) or Christian nations (the UK or Denmark).What the hell are you on about? Are explicitly Muslim nations maintaining an brutal occupation of Jews somewhere that we are unaware of? Are these \\"Christian\\" nations? The problems with Israel's existence are not invalidated because there are homogeneous cultural states elsewhere in the world. If I was him reviewing a white mans critique of North African or middle eastern nations that would be proof enough to call him a closer white nationalist or at the very least, deeply racist.I have no idea what this means. Here's my attempt at rephrasing:If you were him, reviewing a white man's critique of North African or Middle Eastern nations, that would be proof enough to call you(?) (him?) a closer(huh?) white nationalist or at the very least, deeply racist.

Article:Kamala Harris has rarely been seen answering questions since she became the Democrats presidential candidate  but on this evidence, there was no need to hide.The vice-president appears to have been using her time away from the TV microphones to find her feet in the race that she entered so unexpectedly in July after President Bidens collapse. In an interview with CBSs 60 Minutes on Monday night, she hit her stride.It was not just the self-assured way she gave mainly plausible answers, free of word salads, to the questions posed by the veteran interviewer Bill Whitaker, who brought her back to the actual question at hand several times after she talked herself away from it.Nor was it just Harriss relaxed demeanour, although this was light years ahead of the jittery mess she made of the rare big interviews she gave earlier in her vice-presidency.Harris scored highly by coming across as disarmingly human the several times that questions challenged her to give a politicians answer. One of these moments came on the campaign trail in Wisconsin with Liz Cheney, a lifelong Republican whose opposition to Donald Trump has led her to side with Harris.Whitaker asked Harris what she would have said four years ago if he had told her then that she would be campaigning with the ultra-conservative Cheney. Harris, standing alongside her new supporter, shrugged, smiled and replied: That would be great!Another small moment that showed how Harris had settled into her role came when Whitaker asked what type of gun she had (a Glock) and then whether she had ever fired it. Again, Harriss reaction did not come across as some kind of politicians calculation. Yes, of course I have! she exclaimed, laughing like a regular person might do to such a daft question, before clarifying that she did so on a shooting range.Harris still has some gaps in her repertoire that make her look less than the finished item, notably dodging a question on whether the US should welcome Ukraine as a member of Nato.She also remains vulnerable on border security, and at first attempted to gloss over several years of record arrivals of asylum seekers and illegal entrants.Pressed by Whitaker on why the Biden-Harris administration did not take the more decisive steps it took this year three years before, she talked about how Biden introduced an immigration bill on day one. (He did, but it was unacceptable to Republicans because of a proposed wholesale amnesty for those in the US illegally.)Then she said: Fast-forward to a moment when a bipartisan group of members of the United States Senate  came up with a border security bill. This was the one Trump told Republicans to kill, a good campaigning point for Democrats, but her fast-forward was doing a lot of work to gloss over three years of failure.Whitaker challenged her a couple of times, but Harris was not fazed and stuck to her guns  from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions. This may do little, however, to win over voters sceptical about her border credentials.The surest sign that she has found her feet as a White House candidate came when Whitaker attempted to revive her discomfort on weak answers from earlier interviews.In her rather friendly MSNBC appearance, the only other solo network question-and-answer she has done, Harris was at a loss when pressed on how she would pay for all her expensive policy promises if Congress refused to increase taxes on the rich. At the time, she simply insisted that taxes had to increase.On Monday night, she gave a more convincing answer that played up her own experience in Congress and her connections: You know, when you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what Im talking about, because their constituents know exactly what Im talking about. Their constituents are those firefighters and teachers and nurses [who want fairer taxation].The suggestion was that, once the election is out of the way, a sufficient number of members from across the aisle would be willing to work on deals to improve living standards.She had given another weak answer to CNN, in a joint interview with Tim Walz, her running-mate, when asked about her flip-flops on fracking and decriminalising crossing the border. Then, she said that my values have not changed as a catch-all way of explaining 180-degree policy shifts, which simply did not work.On 60 Minutes, she had a better explanation: In the last four years, I have been vice-president of the United States and I have been travelling our country, and I have been listening to folks. And seeking what is possible in terms of common ground. I believe in building consensus. We are a diverse people. Geographically, regionally, in terms of where we are in our backgrounds. And what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus.This communicated not only her experience but her contrast with Trump on a willingness to compromise to get reasonable deals done. It showed just how much Harris has learned as a candidate in her relatively short campaign and also proved the value of finally facing up to a big network interview in an election marked so far by the soft non-interview on both sides  and a no-show by Trump, who backed out of the chance to feature in his own 60 Minutes interview, claiming that he was treated unfairly four years ago.Harriss final answer exuded confidence: asked for her reaction to Trump pulling out of 60 Minutes, she urged viewers to watch one of his rallies instead. Youre going to hear conversations that are about himself and all of his personal grievances, she said. And what you will not hear is anything about you, the listener. You will not hear about how hes going to try to bring the country together, find common ground.She concluded: I believe in my soul and heart the American people are ready to turn the page.","title":"Kamala Harris 60 Minutes interview: she was disarmingly human"},{"text":"They have no substance so all they can do is move the goalposts.?","title":"Kamala Harris 60 Minutes interview: she was disarmingly human"},{"text":"Journalists have always struck me as something really stupid people who pretend to want to know \\"the truth\\" go into as a career.

I used to be much more liberal. Grew up in Massachusetts, lower/middle class, am also mixed race, black and white. I may get downvoted for this, but I'm actually voting for Trump for the first time this election cycle, and for a million reasons that would be too difficult to fit into this post. I will say that Trump is an imprecise speaker. During the town hall where he said he'd be a dictator on day one, what he said in full context was \\"no no no, only on day one. We're closing the border, and we're drilling drilling drilling. After that I'm not a dictator, ok.\\" He's basically saying that if those things make me a dictator, then I guess I'm a dictator, if that makes sense. It was a very \\"lighthearted\\" conversation and was tongue and cheek. It's an example of one of the core principles of humor (incongruity theory).   \\nI don't want to make this about me because it isn't about me, but my transition into becoming more conservative took 4 years or so! I'm also not religious at all. I just started to notice things, and how the media was taking advantage or certain narratives (both sides do this of course). I believe it started the night trump got elected. Everyone seemed to all of a sudden hate Trump. While he was running, he was featured on a host of media outlets, such as Jimmy Kimmel, Oprah, Jimmy Fallon, Saturday Night Live, and others. Weeks later, when elected, he was suddenly made out to be the devil incarnate. Meanwhile I would argue that Biden has said some truly racist things and the media rarely talks about it. In an interview with Charlamagne tha God, he said that \\"if you have problem figuring out if you're for me or Trump then you ain't black.\\" This implies that black people are too stupid and ignorant to think for themselves. He also said about Obama that we've \\"got the first sort of, mainstream African American who is articulate and bright, and clean and a nice looking guy, I mean that's a storybook man.\\" I could go on about this. Again, both sides say bad things, but right now I am just speaking on the left.  \\nBack in July I was out eating dinner with my parents and two brothers. Both of my parents knew at that point that I was somewhat conservative. Anyways, we got into a heated argument when talking about culture and crime within the black community, and I was called a Nazi and a racist (I'm on good terms with them btw). I was told that I haven't experienced racism, despite rooming with two roommates in college who would repeatedly make objectively racist jokes and use the \\"hard R.\\" I know this is an anecdote but still... All of this has opened my eyes to how easy it is to frame someone. It's a clever strategy. the strategy basically works like this: \\"hey I'm just going to call you a racist and a bigot to make you look like an extremist so that no one takes you seriously!\\" But yeah overall I'd say I'm socially liberal. I work as a software engineer but I also work as an actor. I'm interested in people from all walks of life.  \\nOk sorry for the rambling lol.

Because lets say the wind drops as its forecasted to, the storms size is also expected to grow. And bigger size hurricanes churn up more water/surge then a smaller size storm like right nowThis is why I still do remain somewhat concerned some of the hurricane guidance may be overdoing the amount of weakening. A smaller size storm like Milton can go up in intensity and drop pressure really fast (we absolutely saw that) but also weaken in intensity and raise pressure really fast (which were also seeing right now because latest recon pass was around 910mb, as its likely undergoing what is called an eyewall replacement cycle. But that eyewall replacement cycle/the storm growing larger as it approaches the FL coast means that it can maintain its intensity for longer, but also wont strengthen as fast. But the maintaining of strength for longer is the more important part here with the bigger size.I still think itll weaken significantly from where it is right now, but for surge impacts its not gonna matter because of that storm growth. In fact I argue the surge could be even worse (storm surge wise) with a large upper end Category 3-low end Category 4 landfall as is forecasted then if this were a small compact Category 5 storm at landfall like right now","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 7, 2024 - 29 days until election day!"},{"text":"It's god's will then - she is punishing them....","title":"Florida Gov.

There are a few hundred immigration judges in the United States, and they all process tens of thousands of cases. That's without even mentioning the infrastructure. Yes, the tent camps are despicable, but all the real immigration facilities where they detain illegals are pretty much packed and the beds, in my experience, are being reserved for people who are likely to succeed in their visa applications, ergo not the family that crossed the border on foot from Mexico. Add to this that a non-zero number of people being trialed for illegal immigration are ex-cons that cannot be housed with normal people otherwise they will kill them, and even more beds in the higher quality facilities end up reserved for people who frankly don't deserve better treatment than people who just want to be Americans and haven't done anything wrong.I don't think there's a lot of political will on either side to increase resources to immigration prosecution either. It's not just the law that needs an overhaul, the physical systems are not able to withstand the capacity that's required and expanding would be horribly expensive. We're talking about millions of dollars just to build one facility that will only provide a few thousand beds, when there are a million more a year to accommodate.","title":"The Democrats Hispanic Voter Problem Deepens"},{"text":"Not even close.","title":"Florida Gov.
