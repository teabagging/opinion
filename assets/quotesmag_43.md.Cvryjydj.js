In response, the U.S. said it will continue providing arms to Israel.**Scott Paul, director of peace and security at Oxfam America, which also helped compile the report, said that the Biden administrations decision to continue military support to Israel **has put a final, deadly exclamation point on its policy of disregard for US law and the lives of Palestinians**.**Now, as communities in North Gaza are erased and starved to death, Israel will receive a steady stream of US weapons with a newly furnished seal of approval, Paul said. We provided sound humanitarian evidence and it was ignored. This is an unsurprising but still disgraceful decision.*Dems already fucking lost the election, what other reason do you have for supporting this continued slaughter?They **never** cared for the Palestinians, it was all for fucking show.  You couldn't even do the bare minimum.And yes, before anyone chimes in and says, \\"oh but Trump will just reverse anything he does!\\"Yeah, no shit, but at least it's something.

The idea that people seeing the superdelegate numbers (which the DNC asked the media not to report) and mistook them as having actually already voted so that caused them to vote for Hillary makes no sense for a simple reason.  Hillary did vastly better with voters (registered Democrats and older voters) that would have more experience with voting in previous Democratic primaries thus would logically have a better understanding how superdelegates work (seeing how they had been around since 1984).  In contrast, Bernie did vastly better with voters (registered Independents and younger voters) that would have less experience with voting in previous Democratic primaries thus would logically have a worse understanding how superdelegates work.The second point about Clinton bailout of the DNC is true, but it ignores that agreement said \\"nothing in this agreement shall be construed to violate the DNC's obligation of impartiality and neutrality through the Nominating process\\" and that \\"all activities performed under this agreement will be focused exclusively on preparations for the General Election and not the Democratic Primary.\\"","title":"AP Race Call: Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz wins reelection to U.S. House in Florida's 25th Congressional District"},{"text":"is IT a boy or girl?

Its just a way to invalidate your experiences and make *themselves* feel better about not helping you worth a damn. Similar to what you said about denying that the problems exist and offering no solution or help. Its infuriating, honestly, especially when they say it from atop a pedestal of privilege and theyd have a very different perspective (one not so toxically positive) if they were in my shoes back then. Toxic negativity is just being negative all the time, constantly complaining, constantly making things into a bigger problem than they need to be, just overall being a downer. Gossip, criticism, blame, bullying, sabotage, complaining, and finger-pointing all come to mind. Its basically just a really negative person that no one wants to be around. Which is why I think toxic positivity is worse because its much more covert and has a bigger impact on your mental health over time whenever people around you are always toxically positive. Its akin to gaslighting and making you feel like youre crazy because you experienced something terrible and they wont acknowledge it. Its a dysfunctional form of emotional management that doesnt even acknowledge the negative emotions. Narcissists will be toxically positive towards other peoples issues, and toxically negative when it comes to their own.EDIT: Also, I wanted to add that at least toxically negative people are capable of empathy.

Nikema Williams to step down as chair of the Democratic Party of Georgia, though he has not issued a public call for her to resign, according to a half-dozen party officials.**The first-term Democrats aides would not say on the record whether he wants a leadership change, as other party figures have, after former President Donald Trump recaptured Georgia. But the party officials say he urged Williams to step down ahead of his 2026 reelection fight.**Williams sent messages to friends and allies about their phone conversation, and in texts obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution she claimed Ossoff told her: I dont want you leading the party with me at the top of the ticket.**I hope this doesnt have to become public, but this is something Im absolutely planning to pursue, Williams said Ossoff told her in the text exchange, which allies of both Williams and Ossoff say confirmed as generally accurate.**The rift compounds nasty internal Democratic finger-pointing that followed Trumps victory in Georgia, one of seven battleground states the Republican swept last week on his way to a second term.**The Democratic officials, several of whom requested anonymity to talk about private discussions, said the conversations took place shortly after Trump won Georgia by roughly 120,000 votes, flipping the state back into the GOP column four years after Joe Bidens narrow victory.**In the hours after the election, about a dozen donors, activists and officials*?[*spoke publicly to the AJC*?](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ajc.com%2Fpolitics%2Fas-georgia-democrats-struggle-with-trumps-comeback-some-point-fingers-inward%2FF3TC3YE3FZDKVI5CYNDRJXR2RQ%2F)*about their concerns with Williams leadership.

Others say Williams cant effectively raise money for the state party because of federal restrictions since shes a member of Congress.**Theres a lot of frustration in Democratic circles right now, said Parker Short, the head of the Young Democrats of Georgia. Now is the time to act. She should value the opinions of people inside the party who say that we cant afford for her to lead the party another two years.*","title":"U.S. Sen.

A lot of the talk was focused on two things: first, how the left can more effectively populate the new media ecosystem especially podcasts, YouTube and TikTok with shows that have a more progressive lean. The idea is to provide a counter to the right-wing oversaturation of those platforms. Then the primary method proposed was to create content thats not explicitly political but introduces progressive ideas in little normalizing moments, like TV shows have done for generations. So these arent inherently bad ideas. The problem is, I think theyre too late. If were only just now talking about how to take advantage of new media, were not going to catch up to the right wing and loosen its hold on it. If were trying to catch up weve already lost. We need to be looking at whats on the horizon  what comes *after* podcasts, and YouTube, and TikTok, and how do we plan to get on the ground floor of those arenas? Im also skeptical that we can accomplish that goal via entertainment-focused content that subtly nudges people towards not being total shitheads. The right-wing manosphere was partly created as a backlash to the so-called woke media. And its not new, people have been raging against hey maybe you should care about other people since Mister Rogerss first episode. (Hayes Code, Im looking at you.) Im not saying we shouldnt do that at all  it should be our baseline  but I dont think its the silver bullet a lot of people think it is. Thoughts?

The early data so far shows the States where we ran a campaign moved less to the right than the nation as a whole.  I don't think that automatically makes Harris a uniquely strong candidate.  It makes a billion dollar campaign with an enormous volunteer effort somewhat effective with her at the top.  We can probably safely assume the campaign was better with her on top than Biden post-debate.  But I don't think we should *assume* she outperformed any number of Democratic leaders that we couldn't turn to in the Summer of 24.Personally I think she ran a good 2024 campaign.  She wasn't perfect, but she was strong than most people thought she could be.

Their suggested  strategy was two fold: First, rapidly increasing the migrant population into the U.S. states so they could be counted in subsequent censuses and thereby add to the number of democratic representatives in congress as well as increase the number of electoral college votes granted in states considered democratic strongholds.\\nSecond: placement of millions of migrants into key swing states, and the fast tracking of citizenship for these new arrivals as well as guaranteeing benefits and opportunities to the new communities, thereby making them beholden to the DNC and inclined to vote accordingly.\\nTheir thesis was that if these goals could be accomplished, the Democrats would be in position to win every single election, whereby effectively ending the 2-party system. What they did not account for though was fact that most of those migrating in from Mexico and Latin America brought with them their deeply Catholic values and a traditional culture which aligns with the conservative side of the political aisle much more that they did with the authors or their partys politics.Note: I may have butchered the title that Im referencing here.

Identity politics is easy, in my opinion. We're currently watching people play identity politics with young men, usually young white men, and it's not exactly pretty. Overall, while targeted demographic outreach is needed, I think more inclusive and broad messaging is better for our society. As far as \\"wokeness\\" goes, from my experience with right wing colleagues, I think that a lot of it is just fear of the unknown and changes to the status quo. They're also afraid of indoctrinating children to think purely in terms of privilege hierarchies.   \\n  \\nThere is an aspect that I kind of agree with them on though, and that's the potential for a slippery slope into greater cancel culture (which frankly exists in all directions, not just left). Look at what's happening to Rep. Seth Moulton right now. I don't think that I agree with him, but he's not a crazed anti-trans bigot. Instead of turning on him and alienating potential voters in the coalition, it might help to focus on actual anti-trans right wingers, of which there are many. They're way more numerous and loud and are actively pushing harmful policies and trying to stir up violence. Communities suffering from racism can still have their own prejudices (a lot of anti-Black prejudice in non-white groups). They also tend to be culturally conservative and thus align more with the right (as we're quickly finding out). They might not think much about their demographics hampering them and view mention of it as divisive. As far as I can tell, a lot of Latinos view themselves as white or close to it. Men in these potentially disadvantaged communities might have the same grievances that white men have. Speaking personally as a non-white person, there's definitely a brand of \\"wokeness\\" that annoys me as well, and I wouldn't be surprised if it annoys a lot of people here as well. It's \\"corporate woke-ism.\\" This kind has been pretty hilariously and incisively parodied on South Park (Pander Stone) and The Boys (Brave Maeve's Inclusive Kingdom, I'm laughing just typing that out and proofreading what I wrote). It's essentially bare minimum signs of \\"support\\" while doing nothing to actually help disadvantage communities. Disney tends to do this a lot. I've heard complaints from LGBT that Disney will have one word of dialogue or background shot that's LGBT and then call it a day and pat themselves on the back (can confirm in both Onward and Star Wars IX).

That doesnt exactly pull in the  more moderate and independent voters needed to win.Dems should have been more focused on kitchen table voter concerns.   Its the economy stupid, as well as the border security/ illegal immigration, and addressing the escalating global wars.  Turns out that demonizing a working class voter,  who cant afford groceries,  for using the wrong gender pronoun is not a winning strategy.

Hes lived up to so many of the promises that hes made. There is one promise left that he can fulfill: being a transitional figure, he stated. He could resign the presidency in the next 30 days, make Kamala Harris the president of the United States. He could absolve her from having to oversee the Jan. 6 transition of her own defeat.Multiple senior White House officials said that they doubted Biden would consider leaving office early, with one senior official noting that the president wouldnt go out of his way to gift the vice president an honor she didnt actually earn.However, while one former senior White House official doesnt see President Biden going for it, a decision from Biden to elevate Harris in the final months of the administration might help unify the Democratic Party ahead of four years of Trump governance.Another current senior White House official, though, blatantly disputed the healing factor a two-month Harris presidency might have on the party.Theres a sense that we tried to jam Vice President Harris down voters throats instead of hold an open primary, that person assessed.

They came about in 1982 meaning before 2016 they had featured in six primaries that didn't have an incumbent presidency running for a second term. They also repeatedly made national news in the 2008 primary with media reporting whether or not they would break for Obama (they did). That is our brief history of superdelegates.Now back to the discussion regarding the demographic breakdown of the 2016 Democratic Primary. Bernie famously did best with Registered Independents (63.3%) and the youngest voting bloc of 17-29 year olds (71.6%). Conversely, Hillary did best with Registered Democrats (63.7%) older voters of 65+ (71.3%).Meaning Hillary did best with demographics that would have the most experience with the Democratic Primary Process (and thus conversely superdelegates) while Bernie did best with groups with that would least experience with the Democratic Primary Process (and thus conversely superdelegates) with less than half of his best age demographic being of voting age for the last competitive Democratic primary in 2008 and a number not even being out of middle school at that time.However, for the Bernie supporter argument the superdelegates made more people vote for Hillary because they didn't understand that they weren't regular delegates it would require the belief that it was voters with the vastly more experience with Democratic Primary process to be the ones that lacked the understanding of what superdelegates were while those with vastly less experience with Democratic Primary process to be the ones that were uniquely insightful in understanding what superdelegates really were.Which makes zero sense besides through extreme arrogance of thinking everyone else is just dumber than you.","title":"AP Race Call: Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz wins reelection to U.S. House in Florida's 25th Congressional District"},{"text":"It's giving Assistant to the ~~Regional Manager~~ OMB Director energy","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 12, 2024"},{"text":"It's an office that has no power.

A lot of people vote without identifying heavily with politics - in fact, the topic may not even come up for some couples or friend groups until voting time, if it comes up at all. If the 4B movement took off, it wouldn't neccesarily just be extremists that took part. It would affect whoever it reached - which, thanks to the internet, isn't going to  just be radically feminist women who are in loudly political social circles. Conservative men look like lots of different things. Look at Andrew Tate for crying out loud. *Plenty* of Trump voters engage very heavily in hookup culture whenever they get the chance, and don't particularly care about the political compass of the women they bring home. And that's what this is about - men, who aren't exactly immersed in traditional Conservative ethics, voting for Trump for petty or ignorant reasons. Completely glossing over the threats against women's access to abortion, financial aid for the vulnerable, safety for undocumented immigrants and equal rights for lgbt people - either not caring, or aligning with those values in some way. It's important to understand that Trump voters have an enourmous spectrum of personal politics. The 4B movement's abstinence goal would mostly affect men who aren't conservative enough to avoid hookup culture, but are conservative enough to vote in someone who openly intends to strip the human rights away from various groups. Since both Republican and non-political women exist, the 4B movement won't make it impossible for men to get laid. It will just make it more difficult. Might grow the incel community a bit. \\nBut refusing to have kids, regardless of whether it affects liberal men or conservative men, will obviously lower birth rates. If I remember correctly, conservatives fucking hate that. \\nSo yeah I think conservatives should hope the 4B movement doesn't reach the States. Not having babies is sounding much more appealing to women these days, and it's much more achievable than abstinence, don't you think?","title":"CMV: Sex Strikes and the General 4B movement is ineffective.

And this is in *North Carolina*.It also ignored the history of North Carolina splitting the ticket. Out of the past 32 years, a republican has only held the governor's office for 4 years, only one term. Yet in those same 32 years, NC has only voted for the Democratic Presidential candidate once, for Obama in 2008. North Carolinians almost always split the ticket. A Republican hasn't controlled the NC Attorney General's office since the *1800s*.It also ignored that all the polling predicted this would happen. All the polling right before the election had the democrats slightly ahead for AG, a big lead for Governor, and neck and neck for Lt Gov. It also had Trump somewhat comfortably ahead of Kamala. So these results are expected.Also, you're just completly wrong about the House and Senate? There was no senator race this year at all, NCGOP actually gained US Houses seats because of gerrymandering.

I voted for Harris-Walz becausea) I have learned to not fall for the regular disinformation it seems many Trump voters fall forb) more importantly, I fucking care about democracy independent of where I happen to bec) how actually absurd is our timeline that the people getting bombs dropped on them (i.e.,, people like me) and those like us (arab muslims,  lebanese americans,  some black people, some hispanic people) thought that the most racist spiteful childish selfish hateful grifting treasonous American in our generation is actually better for them? lol. I swear, it feels like I am losing my mind living here, nad the war doesn't, um, help. I no longer expect to be here when we reach that day though.Oh yeah, no way you and I are here when we as humans get there. But we will get there.I personally have to believe so in order to act so, and also one way to make sure we never get there is to never act. So, to me, again, it's simple. If I survive this war here in Lebanon, I'll keep fighting for democratic ideals (democratic change, here in Lebanon, that's a way's away)  here in Lebanon and definitely stateside.I\\\\m just so very disappointed in citizens of both my nations. For decades we had so much power, but we just let bad people take over and do bad things.I'm also so very sad for them too, because I also understand  politics is no where that simple and the republicans spend decades getting us to this point (and so did the billionaire class).It's just so crazy to be part of one nation where my vote literally never mattered for anything (I'm late age millennial, and I got to vote in Lebanon *twice* in my life lol. They just either don't hold elections, or postpone them unilaterally defying the constitution lol).If MAGA wants to do that to the U.S. of A. then let them have at it. Because I know many of us aren't going anywhere, and *we* won't stop our fight.The work has just begun, because right now it's states and the American people that are the last line of defense in protection of democracy.I am not being hyperbolic.I am from, also, a place where there is no democracy but only promises of one that quickly turned into essentially warlord-rule/oligarchy/feudalism or whatever the fuck term may be most applicable lol.Here's a toast to Americans who believe in our inalienable rights  that applies to all the peoples that just happen to be on American soil, but more importantly, for these ideals that extend way beyond our tiny little country in the grand scheme of our species' history. Like iI said, I  too hope one day we''lll value human life -  all human life, everywhere.","title":"Its Not Like There Werent Chances to Do This Differently Dearborn, Michigan, turned against Kamala Harris decisively.

To me this says the US will force China's hand to attack and we will have a defensive position to try to stop them and cause as many casualties as possible then attack the Chinese mainland. I have no clue what victory is in a war against China.\\nOne thing mentioned in the Wikipedia page was that the former Marine generals that criticized the plan for several reasons. One of the reasons being there is no plan or ability to resupply or evacuate Marine forces on the small island chains. They will be dropped off and there's a strong possibility that aircraft and naval ships will be hundreds of miles away on other missions.

This is what they do. Moral panics, fearmongering campaigns, complete distortions of reality, all for the sake of inciting hatred and vindicating a small faction of conservative's prejudices, phobias and paranoid delusions.Despite all the histrionics from conservatives on social media this election cycle about the radical left's plot to indoctrinate the masses with transgender and anti-white pedagogy, to perform sex change operations on students and immigrants against their will, to \\"groom\\" children and expose them to pornography in schools, to flood women's sports with men, to force children to attend drag shows, to expose young kids to graphic material in class, to use the education system to recruit children into the LGBTQ and cultural Marxist movement, to use companies to promote the transgender and gay agenda.Despite the hysteria from conservatives around critical race theory, \\"DEI\\" and affirmative action initiatives, \\"anti-racism,\\" imposed white guilt, a radical and secular agenda that's persecuting Christians, a \\"defund the police\\" movement that only a fringe minority of liberals actually took literally, while most were merely asking for accountability, the addressing of racial injustices, profiling, stereotyping, police brutality, and better de-escalation training for police officersdespite all this culture war driven panic and outrage, voters did not turn out en masse to protect their children from a long list of LGBTQ boogeymen, voters did not turn out to in solidarity against the \\"woke mind virus.\\"Because it's all a bunch of propaganda and scare tactics, the same old story told again and again about some liberal agenda to transform American culture into something depraved, abnormal, irreligious, and evil.The key drivers this election were the economy, foreign policy and immigration, while most Americans, and low propensity voters in particular, have entirely memory-holed Trump's disastrous economic and foreign policy record, and the fact that Republicans would rather run on immigration as a fearmongering wedge issue, than actually address it with policies that aren't extreme, non-viable, impractical and inhumane...But let's address the hysteria around \\"wokeness.\\" Conservatives claim that it's \\"the left\\" who are obsessed with race, gender identity, sexual orientation, etc... but what I see is often the opposite. Where figures on \\"the right\\" constantly condemn \\"woke culture\\" and criticize a liberal, racial, gender or DEI related agenda whenever the opportunity presents itself. I see conservatives instigating this culture war conflict disproportionately more than I see liberals living up to these criticismsLet's not forget that the modern Republican party was built off of a conservative movement that thrived by inciting racial tensions, scapegoating minorities, and appealing to the grievances of white southerners in particular who were dismayed by civil rights legislation, desegregation, and law and order dog whistling that inculcated white conservatives with fears of racial crime in their neighborhoods.Think about the modern panic around critical race theory and cultural Marxism, and how we are apparently teaching children to feel guilty for being white because history lessons are a little discomforting for parents, albeit accurate. Think about how some conservatives now claim that racism is over while spouting \\"colorblind\\" rhetoric, yet it's anti-white discrimination that's the *real* threat. Think about the record number of challenges to book titles in libraries, thousands more every year, most of which conservatives haven't even read. But because they feature a POC as the protagonist, or contain a queer character or title, they must either be rife with pornography or teaching children to hate whiteness.Think about all the fearmongering and misinformation surrounding immigrants, and how Republicans have emboldened an ultra nationalistic, nativist, white supremacist movement in this country. Think about the promotion of the \\"great replacement theory.\\" Are these things not centered largely around race and ethnicity?Think about how Republicans highlight isolated black crimes in particular in order to raise fears. Think about how every time there's a mass shooting, Republicans direct the conversation to gun violence and murder rates in places like Chicago, when the reality is, rates of gun violence and death rates are highest in Republican-led states like Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Wyoming, Alaska etc...Think about the outrage and panic centered around Bud Light after the company sent a single custom can to a transgender personality. Think about the moral outrage directed at target for selling rainbow sandals and t shirts. These are just a couple of examples where conservatives act like a coalition of liberals got together and forced these things to happenThink about all of the outrage around \\"DEI.\\"Think about all the race related criticisms that Letitia James received, or Jasmine Crockett, even Ketanji Brown Jackson. They were dubbed \\"DEI hires,\\" \\"ghetto trash,\\" despite being more than qualified for their positions. Hell, Jackson was far more qualified for her position than Clarence Thomas was back in the day during his judicial appointment, and Thomas has literally been labeled, \\"the greatest beneficiary of affirmative action in US history\\" by those closest to him.Think about how when gay or black actors appear in a movie, TV show, commercial, or any form of media, there's always someone crying \\"woke.\\"Think about how when some black MAGA personality speaks out on social media, conservatives rally around them and claim *their* appeal to black people.Thinking about the AI images that circulated over social media of Donald Trump posing with black people.Think about Trump's disingenuous showings at black events, where he sometimes rambles on incoherently about how he's done more for black people than Abraham Lincoln, or remarks that Kamala Harris is \\"all of a sudden\\" black.Think about the outrage over litter boxes in schools. Think about how race, gender identity and sexual orientation in particular are the target of countless Republican-led legislative efforts.Think about Republicans wanting to roll back civil rights based on sex or gender discrimination.And all the fearmongering propaganda centered around the LGBTQ movement.Or how conservatives are so obsessed with pronouns, that they can't help but constantly make the same \\"joke\\" over and over again, while crying \\"God have mercy!\\" if anyone uses non-heteronormative pronouns, sometimes literally passing bills to prevent itOh, and the very disturbing fixation on pedophilia and conspiracy theories centered around child sex abuse rings and child sacrifices, and their bizarre tendency to accuse their opponents of being pedophiles.The point being, who's really obsessed with race and gender identity?At any rate, this is the Republican M.O., and it's become much more effective lately at riling up a loud minority of seething culture warriors, because misinformation, propaganda, unsubstantiated rumors, clickbait, outrage and hate spreads farther, travels faster, circulates for longer and reaches wider audiences compared to anything resembling the truth. Studies have shown this consistently. Sadly, the truth receives far less engagement.","title":"Voters rejected a woke America  time for Democrats to listen and learn"},{"text":"No they didnt.

The article isnt calling for more pandering to moderate voters by moving right; its pointing out how that exact approach already failed.

Biden ran as a progressive (on paper, anyway) to get elected, and now were back to the same old move right for the suburbs playbook.The Democrats keep insisting the key to winning back voters is shifting right... but funny enough, voters in those moderate suburbs didnt exactly rally behind them. Schumers grand plan to win them over by distancing from the progressive base didnt work then, and its not working now. The last truly popular progressive, FDR, was so well-received they had to implement term limits. Yet here we are, convinced that the real path to success is to abandon the policies that actually resonate with working people.And if youre worried about political survival, maybe look to Bernies campaigns. He showed us theres a significant group of Americans who want to move left, even if theyve been conditioned to recoil at buzzwords like socialism. But instead of tapping into that energy, weve got the Harris 2024 campaign continuing the age-old tradition of assuming that moving right will solve everything.Ask yourself this: Do you want worse and more expensive healthcare than you currently have, or would you prefer a system where everyone gets healthcare, and no one has to make car payments just to go to the hospital?The lesson here is clearmove left. 100%.","title":"Union Leader: Its Time for the Democrats to Wake Up"},{"text":"I was unaware until recently but according to Norm Finkelstein, Mehdi played a key role in smearing and ousting Corbyn as an antisemiteSo through that Mehdi played a bigger role in undermining Palestinian advocacy than even many hardcore zionists","title":"Kamala Harris supporter Mehdi Hasan finds time to go after the Green Party for being \\"cynics\\" and shaming their results in the 2024 election"},{"text":"Leftist propaganda bs!

You use a lot of very harsh language describing sex work, most frequently referring to it as \\"degrading.\\" In line with my last comment, I think that in situations where undue force/influence is being used, that's an appropriate description. However, you don't seem to make a distinction between those situations and others where woman actively choose and are happy to participate in it (as much as they can, as per my first comment). You seem to view the very idea of introducing an economic element to the dynamic as inherently degrading, and I'd ultimately like to ask why?Yes, sex can be an intimate expression of love between partners and plenty of people view that as their preferred way to engage with it. In that context, I could understand the perversion of a seemingly sacred act by removing that romanticized element for economic practicality... but that isn't the only way to view sex. Stripped of symbolic meaning and the weight that we put on sex culturally, it is just physical contact for the sake of pleasure. Beyond that, everyone has their own unique perception of it and their preferred ways on interacting with their sexuality, but there aren't really wrong/right ways to do so (within reason so long as everyone involved is able and willing to consent). I am close friends with multiple sex workers who went into it specifically because it was gratifying for them on a personal level - some to explore their own self-image and understand who they are/want to be, some just because they straight up enjoy sex.Similarly, if one does consent to sex, but also considers the monetary gain that could come from it, they may need to consider why they connect sex with an act of labourThis question from the original post is relevant here, because the straightforward answer is that it's an act of labor because it requires your time, effort, and bodily involvement, just like any other form of labour. Even for someone who enjoys/wants to engage in sex work, it is still labour the same way that an artist creating their work to sell but enjoys the process nonetheless is performing labour. You specifically try to answer your own question by offering explanations that could reconcile the conflict between the presumed sacred nature of sex with the seemingly contradictory act of doing it for any reason other than explicit romantic/sexual attraction. That isn't inherently wrong, but it only really addresses your perception of/relationship to sex without leaving room for the idea that other people may view it differently.I point this out because that glorified view of sex as something beyond a physical act is also a byproduct of cultural influences, largely the same puritanical ideals I discussed before that label sex work as inherently inferior. There is just as much feminist discourse surrounding fighting those influences for women to reclaim control over their own sexualities instead of having patriarchal standards dictate how/when they should be able to express it. To be clear, I'm not saying you are wrong to view sex the way you do or anything like that. I'm just pointing out that it isn't the only valid way to interact with sexuality and a lot of the contradictions you are basing your point off of can be reconciled by acknowledging that. Different women will have different relationships to sex that will affect how they feel about/engage with sex work, but the way you discuss it seems to discredit those dynamics as exclusively a byproduct of patriarchal/capitalist influences instead of legitimate personal differences.","title":"cmv: The girl-bossification of sex work is not the feminist take people think it is."},{"text":"Yeah it was Covid.

But my father doesnt believe trans women should play womens sports, because he can see the trans womans biological advantages with his own eyes. He can see the muscle, he can see the shoulders, the height. He doesnt even have to read the numerous articles proving their biological advantage. He wont pretend like he doesnt see whats right in front of his eyes in order to fit the mold of political correctness which doesnt make sense to him. My father also believes that families should be involved in the gender affirmation surgeries for minors. California and Canadas laws to isolate parents, or keep them in the dark while the government and schools move forward with invasive surgery, he just cant get on board with that. Thats way too much governmental intervention in the life of a child. This particular issue resulted in my father becoming alienated from tr Democratic Party.

Democrats: you are doing this to your working class voters. Remember: you dont have to agree with everything. Rarely in politics do you meet anyone who agrees on the same two things or a candidate whose policies perfectly align with your desires. But that doesnt mean we push away those who are willing to listen by calling them something theyre not, something hurtful like a bigot. My father went through a lot in his life.

But maybe listen to the people who are telling you what his appeal is? Something needs to change and just trying to shame people into voting our way hasnt worked. So its time for a new strategy and that requires us, the voters, to be more aware of how our words have consequences too. We can be morally right in defending marginalized groups from bigotry but its not helpful to be scolding everyone/entire voting blocs with the assumption that theyre all bigoted.

This zero-sum thinking is driving authoritarian politics on the right because these elitist minded liberals do not care for he working class because they are all dumb or simply not worth any effort. So we have to boycott or ignore platforms like the Joe Rogan experience, Theo Von, Bill Maher, and other podcast hosts because they say a few things we dont like. So lets continue trying to silence people and growing their base while we whither and die politically. The left will soon be even smaller than it is today. Most people want progressive economic policies but they dont want trans women competing against women. They want people who care about the working class to speak to them. Republicans pretend to, but democrat elitists just assumed they could win by adopting a corporatist bureaucracy and the working poor and minorities will always vote for them in very high numbers.Biden really fucked up the southern border. They let way too many people in without using executive actions to slow the influx. I got in arguments with friends over it warning them that it would backfire. Democrats lost shit tons of margins all across the board. Trump didnt just win because of Biden dropping out late after the primaries.

We simplified the figure by lumping together lagged inflation, U.S. inflation expectations, and the unemployment gap under the label domestic Phillips curve drivers (light blue bars).?\\nSo it's a bit hard to pick out what impact domestic labor market tightness had specifically, but I know they were more concerned with focusing on international factors in that paper.\\nBrookings does call out labor market tightness and represent it separately in their model:\\n?The preferred measure for labor market tightness is the vacancy-to-unemployment ratioshown in Figure 5which rose sharply during the pandemic suggesting that the high number of vacancies relative to unemployed may have contributed to rising inflation.\\nIt's included in their overall model in Figures 7 and 8, but they just concluded it wasn't nearly as significant as other supply-side factors:\\n ...margins are by far the most important supply chain variable and crowd out any role for the vacancies-to-unemployment measure. The share of Q4 2021 inflation accounted for by delivery times goes from 58% in our simple model to 24% when we include margins. Labor market tightnessand thus excessive policy stimuluslook to have played a minor role.?\\nIt might just come down to how each built their models. It seems they both struggled with whether the Phillips curve should be linear or not.\\nBrookings:\\n?Lastly, it is possible that tight labor markets have a disproportionate effect on inflation, an argument in favor of a nonlinear Phillips curve as proposed by Gagnon and Collins. Bernanke and Blanchard do not find evidence of such nonlinearity during COVID-19, butagainthis raises the possibility that the role of demand could be understated.\\nSF Fed:\\n?Finally, although we build numerous components into our model, the special nature of the pandemic is reflected through the sizable share of inflation that cannot be explained by any of the drivers included in our analysis. The contribution of the unexplained component (gray bars) is particularly relevant during the early stages of the pandemic, suggesting that the conventional Phillips curve model does not fully account for inflation dynamics during this period, as argued by Benigno and Eggertson (2023).","title":"Democrats' $1.9 trillion bet that blew up"},{"text":"If youre worried about minorities and illegal immigrants taking your job, maybe youre just not that good at your job \\\\\\\\\\\\_()\\\\_/","title":"US Senate Democrats rush to confirm judges before Trump takes office"},{"text":"He probably just watched the lady bump her head on the camera behind her.

You have said in multiple places that, assuming we were talking about a world without those undue influences, you would concede your point because then the people participating in it would be doing so with full autonomy. I absolutely agree that there are horrific practices that happen all too frequently especially in shady and unregulated spaces. In situations where the women involved are being trafficked, pimped out, or otherwise manipulated into providing services, I agree that you are 100% correct. However, I would argue that the \\"Girl-bossification\\" of sex work does more to correct those issues and protect the women being exploited than cause more issues.The reason sex-work is such a problematic industry is specifically because it has been shunned and relegated to the shadows. Society has applied a moral judgement to the act of sex work and deemed it undesirable, which has forced it to exist in a space where most people simply ignore its existence altogether if not actively demonize it to the point where it is impossible to discuss in a straightforward and healthy way. That created an environment where there is no room for oversight, regulation, or protection of the people involved because to do so means engaging positively with something deemed evil.The only way to fix those issues and create a system where sex workers can freely and autonomously interact with it while being protected from abuse is to drag it out into the light. Places like Amsterdam, Las Vegas, and Germany that actively do that have far fewer instances of those problems happening and when they do, have actual systems in place to help rectify them. As it stands in America as a whole, the culturally puritanical view of sex and (by proxy) sex work stops any of those conversations/changes from happening, so the first step in creating a new, healthier system is specifically changing that mindset. Is \\"girl-bossification\\" a perfect/ideal method for getting there? I don't know, but it's definitely a step in the right direction. And even if sex-work has a lot of issues right now, efforts to glorify it aren't necessarily celebrating those issues so much as trying to manifest a world where they aren't as prevalent.","title":"cmv: The girl-bossification of sex work is not the feminist take people think it is."},{"text":"the left has a relatively fair shake in 2026 and 2028.Okay but what about 2025","title":"Nate Silver sees hidden good news for Democrats in 2024 results"},{"text":"Ol' Bulgy Eyes is back","title":"AP Race Call: Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz wins reelection to U.S. House in Florida's 25th Congressional District"},{"text":"This is what I said about her after she endorsed Bernie and the years thereafter and I was met with pretty rough backlash even though now it's plain to see for everyone:I liked her coming out for Bernie and all, but I wouldn't want her as the nominee. If you look at her history she isn't consistently progressive and she has a *whole* lot of dirt..Before being elected to Congress, she [led the opposition to gay marriage equality](http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/Feb/20/ln/ln09a.html) in the state legislature to the point of actually holding signs and protesting.Progressive Punch has a progressive score based on Crucial Votes, basically a \\"where were you when we needed you\\" vote, for instance all roll call votes where the margin between yes votes and no votes was narrow and could have been changed by a small group of Democrats voting differently. *Tulsi Gabbard scores an F.* Now if you're thinking \\"Hey wait a minute, back in school an F was pretty bad...\\" You're right. An F is very bad. In fact, she ranks at at 143 out of 188 Democrats. What's more, out of all the Democrats with F scores only one has a bluer district. Her opponent Angela Aulani Kaaihue took only 18.9% of the vote and didn't report raising or spending any money at all. In comparison Tulsi spent $1,068,459 of the $2,060,649 she raised. So it's not like she has to vote with right-wingers because her constituents are so right-wing. She has one of the most liberal districts in the country. She has no electoral excuse for voting with the GOP so much - and she does.She clashed with Debbie Wasserman Schultz at the DNC, quit in a big public row and endorsed Bernie, even though their records are not remotely similar. Democrats in Hawaii laughed when Berniebots, grateful for her support but ignorant of her politics, started promoting her as a progressive.She was actually one of Fox's go-to Congresswomen guests for bashing President Obama using GOP talking points. I can't really think of any other so-called progressive doing something like that. She's really friendly with a Republican billionaire named Sheldon Adelson too. But that barely scratches the surface of her sketchy friends. Remember when she was on the news awhile back supposedly for a job interview in the Trump administration? Her pal Steve Bannon arranged for her to meet with Trump. He reached out to her, not vice versa. He loves Tulsi Gabbard and wants to work with her on everything. Bannon was drawn to her when she began publicly excoriating the Obama administration over its plan to defeat ISIL.Tulsi was raised in a politically powerful household. Her father, Mike Gabbard, is a well-known firebrand in Hawaiian politics - his most beloved issue is a virulent rejection of homosexuality and gay rights. Like I mentioned earlier, the younger Gabbard protested against a bill advocating civil unions during her tenure in the Hawaii Congress, holding up signs decrying the proposition. The bill eventually stalled.Gabbard replied to a request for comment on her fathers connections with cult leader Chris Butler (more below) in 2004 with an oddly worded email accusing Honolulu Magazine of a homosexual conspiratorial attempt to discredit her father: I smell a skunk, [Gabbard] wrote. Its clear to me that youre acting as a conduit for the Honolulu Weekly and other homosexual extremist supporters of Ed Case.This political position held until 2012, when she made an about face and declared she supported gay rights-- just in time for the election for Hawaiis 2nd District. And that wasnt the first time she had shed a piece of her past in order to make herself more palatable to voters.Gabbards first marriage, to a man named Eduardo Tamayo, lasted from 2002 to 2006. Tamayo and Gabbard were both involved with a man named Chris Butler, the leader of a Hare Krishna spinoff called the Science of Identity Foundation that is located in Honolulu County.The Hawaii Free Press notes that a number of Butler-connected Hawaiians have contributed to Gabbard and that her involvement with the cult is still an open question.Gabbard has scrubbed all mention of her past with Butlers cult, and with Tamayo, from the internet. The only evidence that is publicly available that Tamayo and Gabbard even know each other-- excepting her Wikipedia page-- is from anti-cult site Flashlight on Roaches. Its grainy, but it does show the two together. Its also the only known photo of Tamayo that is publicly available.Today, Gabbard would prefer not to be known for her Butler-cult related past. The only way to find it is to dig deep into Hawaiian-centric newsletters and publications. But for those in Hawaii, its an omnipresent part of her political and social history. As the Honolulu Civil Beat reported on March 16, 2015: The Gabbard familys ties to Butler still hound her-- in the hallways of the Hawaii State Capitol, on blogs of political observers, on pages of online discussion forums, and in commentary sections of various news sites, including Civil Beats. Now, the mysterious world thats been swirling around Gabbard all her life is coming under closer scrutiny as the 33-year-old congresswomans stature on the national stage steadily rises, and her views on national and international issues-- whether shes standing up for veterans or challenging President Barack Obama over his stance on the Islamic State-- continue to draw the media spotlight.By now, Gabbard has left any ambiguity about her religious beliefs behind. She identifies as a member of the Gaudiya Vaishnavism Sect of the Hindu faith.Its a faith she shares with Indias leader, Narendra Modi. But they share more than that-- they share a hard-right political philosophy that is at odds with Gabbards perceived role as a liberal touchstone in the Democratic Party.Modi, a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, is well known in India for his hardline right wing politics. He was the governor of the state of Gujarat during riots in 2002 that killed over 2,000 Muslims. Modi has always skirted around his level of responsibility for the violence; on the one hand he can appeal to moderates by claiming ignorance, on the other his claims of ignorance are delivered with winks to the countrys more extremist right-wing elements.Modi relies on Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or RSS, for political backing. The BJP and RSSs actions have been repressive and violent and involve a complete distortion of historical and material reality in order to maintain their control of the state.The RSS-BJP alliance also uses the fears and prejudices of the majority Hindu Indian population against Muslims to ensure its hold on power. And those views are views that Gabbard shares with them-- despite her framing of herself as a peaceful warrior....Gabbards relationship with Modi is well documented in Indian publications. Her admiration of the authoritarian leader is the subject of multiple interviews, where she consistently affirms her support of the Prime Minister and his hardline party. In a three-week visit to India on the invitation of Modi himself, she was treated as a state guest and held private meetings with the Prime Minister and members of his party.And Gabbard has protected Modis interests in the US. She fought against a November, 2015, Congressional bill mentioning his role in the Gujarat massacres, decried the USs refusal to issue a visa for the controversial leader before 2014, and supported efforts to rewrite Indian history from a Hindu-supremacist viewpoint in US textbooks.She has worked to relax restrictions on Indian immigration to the US even as she joins with Trumps rhetoric in attempts to refuse allowing Syrian refugees into the country. And her views on Islam mirror those of Modis-- both insist that identifying the faith of Islamists is of paramount importance in fighting extremism (not of Hindu extremism, of course).","title":"Im old enough to remember when Tulsi pretended to be a Democrat"},{"text":"insert Peter Griffin skin tone chart meme here","title":"Its Not Like There Werent Chances to Do This Differently Dearborn, Michigan, turned against Kamala Harris decisively.

That said, I still need to explain what I mean properly.I believe all ideology is social - that is, an ideology isn't just a description of someone's beliefs, but something that only has meaning when placed into the context of some movement or group that represent that ideology. As a result, I don't think the most important thing in determining facts about an ideology is what the ideology professes to believe, but what the group representing it demonstrate they believe and value in practice. That puts the group that represents the ideology as central, and for leftists, it's people who call themselves leftists. If you don't call yourself a leftist, it means you're not a leftist, but there's a very large (by online standards) subculture of people who do call themselves leftists, and care about being leftists, and debates about how is and isn't a leftist, and they make it very clear that they are not liberals and hate liberals and are opposed to liberalism. Modern leftists generally believe very different things from past leftists unless they're Maoist/Leninist dead-enders or other kinds of people who unironically care about Trotskyists, and half of them wouldn't end up claiming Ho Chi Minh, but they would try to claim Mandela.Leftists are not necessarily socialists, communists, or anarchists, but can be any or all of them as long as they call themselves leftists. What they are universally is radical anti capitalists who also have beliefs that are generally radically socially progressive. The graphic in that tweet was made by a group called Grouchy Socialists, who after looking it up, have a page that's popular by 2014 Facebook Leftism standards at 8.6k likes (which is apparently they're third one), and a 4k subscriber subreddit. Not bad I guess? So I think it's fair to infer it goes beyond one person's opinion.Of course, it would only be natural for other leftists to find things to disagree with in the image as well, because large leftist spaces are pretty much defined by leftist infighting about how other leftists aren't leftisting hard enough or doing the bad leftism instead of the good leftism. I assume you're familiar with that. That's why I maintain the best way to determine who is and isn't actually a leftist is really just who says they're a leftist, and they get to be leftists. That's the whole origin of The Discourse as a meme and why Discourse has still survived today to mean \\"Probably pointless political arguments\\" even beyond leftist spaces.I also maintain that online leftists are pretty much the only leftists that matter for like any regular conversation. Rank and file normie members of an ideology are the representative of it, and not higher level activists or politicians or other people whose power is basically founded on approval by the political subculture - because they can only exist *because* of the culture first. Rank and file leftists are all online, and there is close to no meaningful Real Life Leftist Recruitment in comparison to online. The same applies to neolibs, and the far right. There is a real neoliberal organization that does real neoliberalism in real life, and the thing most people know it for is that it has a Twitter account. It would be fair to say \\"Neolibs basically do nothing in real life\\". The difference is that neolibs don't have an extensive culture of telling everyone to Organize and Do Mutual Aid and 'let's aspire to violent revolution and guillotines' and then literally just sit online and tell other pokemon fanartists to kill themselves.I am not using a random Rose Twitter poster. I was a leftist for nearly a decade and deeply involved in leftist scenes so I'm not talking about One Person I Saw On Twitter, but like, the literally everything and everyone I saw and knew for years. That post legitimately represents the beliefs of modern leftists I think pretty well. I can't suddenly deluge you with years worth of poorly socially organized leftist posting and demonstrate how the exact contours of those groups work on the spot if you're skeptical that they exist the way that I say they do, because just having lived through it gets you to the point of the evidence being so clear that you forget the source of the evidence, since it's all about little things that add up over a period of years anyway. I can easily think of tons of random posts that I believe add up to show the culture exists the way I say they do, but if I just link five things, anyone can easily dismiss and say \\"That's just one popular online guy, one poster, one x, and that's just one x too\\" if you just won't accept the logic that I think follows from their existence. I'm frankly baffled by how unexposed you seem to be to online leftist spaces and I'm assuming I have to be misreading that, but when you act like things like that graphic are *not* representative of real leftists, or that online leftists shouldn't be considered actually representative of leftists, I'm kind of left with no other conclusion. The overwhelming decisive influence of online Discourse has been visible in things like progressive activist groups that end up hiring leftists or DSA drama or whatever else for years.I do *not* view leftists as \\"exploiting\\" race, that *is* a word you just put in my mouth. Leftists *sincerely* care about racial justice issues and *sincerely* believe they're doing the right thing by them. I talked about \\"exploiting the race part\\" in terms of a technique *liberals* could do, but I emphasized in the post you're responding to, Leftists *sincerely care about racial justice and want to do the right thing and are motivated by an actual desire for justice*. The key part is not just that they're learning from another race, but specifically from *leftists* of another race, who provably hold positions that are not representative of their group, but *claim* it's representative. *That's* the origin of things like Latinx, cultural appropriation discourse (I'm actually more sympathetic to the 'cultural appropriation is a thing' side in some cases but it's provable that even among second gen immigrants and other groups that this has not been nearly as universal as they appear when in leftist groups - e.g. the Land O' Lakes Ojibwe woman, which I assumed would be something kind of obviously good to remove, had quite a few young, non conservative native people in native spaces saying they were disappointed to see her go, and it seemed like the ones who'd campaigned to see her go were the ones trying to get people on board, but that's an issue where I'm genuinely unsure what's truly representative, and that's not even getting into the native-specific divides and issues as well).It's been seen over and over again that Latinos hate Latinx, many working class voters around the world are increasingly turning to voting for cultural issues over economic ones, unions are abandoning parties they've been traditionally associated with (almost certainly for those reasons), normal people in general have a very low view of socialism and communism (which are their only proxies for leftism other than \\"wokeism\\", because nobody in real life knows what a leftist is), and many normies hate [cancel culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjMPJVmXxV8&amp;vl=en) which absolutely comes from and has been ridiculously strong among leftists. You've interacted with people in real life who don't hate you for being a socialist and representing them, but normie opinions on politics don't come from real life experience, they come from vaguely remembering shit they saw online, and that matters more culturally than one small group in the real world. (Now *many* small groups who *also* effectively steer online content, on the other hand...)I'm also not mystified about why most trans women are leftists. It's actually totally obvious and doesn't require any deep history to explain it. It's because leftist spaces online were the most inclusive to trans women. And it's not that this naturally attracted trans women, but rather, this made many trans women realize they were trans by *being* in those leftist spaces in the first place (Evidence: the number of people who've realized they have gender dysphoria has clearly gone up a lot since 2014, the only change is awareness, the people closest to that awareness would logically be the ones most likely to become aware they have gender dysphoria because dysphoria is very hard to understand externally).How would a \\"leftist\\" approach a corporate owned apartment building?The modal answer is \\"do nothing\\". The second answer is \\"Do discourse forever and never come to a consensus\\", which is equivalent to \\"do nothing\\". There are leftists who *might* do something, and the something that they do might thematically derive from leftist discourse, but there's no actual official or recognized prescription for what to do or how leftists would approach it. The handful of minor organized leftist groups out there would each have their own completely separate process for approaching anything, which will most of the time, default to \\"do nothing\\" from what I've seen of how actual attempts at doing actual organizing among leftists go.And you're dismissing irl \\"leftists\\" for not mattering despite you literally arguing for building community irl?There's absolutely no contradiction here.","title":"Social Systems win Culture Wars - here's how liberals and you (you personally!) can win the next one."},{"text":"You are correct on that speaking of the Republican party they took that from Russia Hungary where this is common.

I see a couple of notable trends in your post and the comments you've made under it that I think could use some examination, but none of them are simple to break down so I may have to make multiple comments. First, I'd like to ask if you're familiar with the concepts of Choice Feminism and Adaptive Preferences? If not, I'd recommend looking into discourse surrounding them because they are directly related to this conversation. In case you haven't (or for anyone who isn't aware), here's a quick summary of the relevant parts of the discourse:\\\\- Choice Feminism poses the idea that any choice being made by a woman is inherently feminist because it is a woman making a choice for herself, be it going into sex work, being a stay at home mom/wife, staying a virgin until marriage, etc. It's mostly applied when looking at women who make choices in line with traditional non-feminist societal/cultural pressures. However, it is also often both misapplied either incompetently - through a post-feminist lens that discusses behaviors as though the patriarchy has already been dismantled - or maliciously - as an excuse to perpetuate the continued oppression of women by reframing the oppressive standards as a choice.\\\\- In response, people reasonably criticize this idea for the same reasons you're describing here. It's not a real autonomous choice if it's being influenced by societal pressures and is just an example of those women participating in their own oppression. They describe those choices as Adaptive Preferences - things that a person \\"wants\\" to do only because they have not been given the options to seek out alternatives. Just as you describe here, if a woman \\"chooses\\" to go into sex work because she has been told it's easy money. If she lived in a world without patriarchal influences, she would not make that choice, therefor it is not a valid feminist choice.\\\\- However, that ends up swinging too hard in the opposite direction. It infantilizes women, patronizing to them by stripping them of autonomy and painting them as people incapable of critical thought and the ability to understand what is best for her. It insists that another person completely removed from her life and circumstances knows what is best for her and that she should just shut up and listen to them instead, which ends up becoming a type of oppression in and of itself. When, in reality, most women making those choices are doing so with a level of awareness of what consequences it will have on their life and are capable of making that cost/benefit analysis of how it will affect them.That's an incredibly brief summary of something that a lot of people have put far more time and effort into exploring than I'll be able to put here, but if anyone wants a more in depth explanation, I'd recommend oliSUNvia's video \\"stop denying women their autonomy.\\" on YouTube as a starting point.Ultimately, it all comes down to a middle ground of acknowledging that nobody is truly free from societal/situational influences, but that doesn't mean everything we choose to do is therefor invalid. Your average worker in any field exists in a capitalist system that forces them into labor. Technically the choice to pursue or engage in any job, even if it's one they enjoy and want to do, is so heavily influenced by the need to earn money to live that it's impossible to say it isn't an adaptive preference. But, when given the choice between two jobs, the choice to do one over the other based on their individual preferences and circumstances is still a valid expression of autonomy, even if it isn't perfectly independent.That also includes sex work, assuming there's not something more specifically harmful at play like trafficking (this is related to one of the other points I wanted to discuss, but I want to wrap up this thought first so I'll explore it more in another comment). Are there softer societal pressures that can still influence women to go into sex work? Absolutely, but an average woman being presented with multiple viable opportunities, critically weighing them against each other, and choosing to go into sex work for whatever particular reasons she deems appropriate is still an autonomous act. Your entire argument is founded on the idea that no woman would ever reasonably make that decision, therefor if one does, she is not in her right mind. Even if she expresses clear reasons why it fits her lifestyle and preferences, it's just because she hasn't critically examined the patriarchy enough to realize that she's wrong and that you know what's best for her. Do you see the Catch-22 there?","title":"cmv: The girl-bossification of sex work is not the feminist take people think it is."},{"text":"Please show your proof that they will get rid of the bill.Trump was president from 2017-2021 and the bill was never removed.

But there are lots of people even in developed countries who need money and will do just about anything to get itAnd onlyfans is probably the single best way of doing that, in reality, for many womenIm not saying it should be and i think the fact prostitution is still the get-money-fast option for women is a failure of humanity. But the truth is, for many girls its the fastest way out of a bad spot. Onlyfans give the ability to turn to sex work as a last resort under your own control, not have to have sex with unvetted strangers, set your own price and schedule, and perhaps even get rich not just pay the billsSo if the last problem is that it is glamourising sex work and encouraging women into it, whilst i agree, id say that lots of the glamorisation comes from the fact it is a safe way to get into sex work and has been highly profitable for a lot of women. There isnt more money in sex work than before; its just that its going directly to the sex worker instead of to the pimp/brothel/strip club owner, so more women are getting rich out of it","title":"cmv: The girl-bossification of sex work is not the feminist take people think it is."},{"text":"VP Harris will be just fine.

Mr Biden has been known on some occasions to snap at reporters.The issue of the hostage deal has come into focus with the appointment of?[Donald Trumps transition team](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/12/team-trump-whos-in-and-whos-out/).Mr Trump announced on Tuesday that Mike Huckabee, the Arkansas Governor, will be appointed as the new Israeli ambassador under his administration.Mr Huckabee is a staunch defender of Israel who has previously denied the legitimacy of the West Bank and said there is no such thing as an occupation of the territory by Israeli settlers.His nomination comes amid a series of appointments that suggest Mr Trump will?[align his foreign policy](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/12/what-trump-hawkish-administration-means-israel-iran-china/)?more closely with the Israeli governments interests than Mr Biden.Marco Rubio, who has been appointed Secretary of State, previously said the Jewish state had no choice but to seek the complete eradication of Hamas in Gaza.Addressing Mr Huckabees appointment, the president-elect said: He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him. Mike will work tirelessly to bring about peace in the Middle East.Mr Bidens outburst is the latest in a series of incidents in which he appears to have lost his patience with journalists.Before dropping out of the presidential race in July, the president was asked if he intended to serve a full second term and responded by saying: Did you fall on your head or something?**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/11/12/can-you-be-hit-head-by-camera-joe-biden-asks-reporter/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/11/12/can-you-be-hit-head-by-camera-joe-biden-asks-reporter/)","title":"Can you be hit on the head by a camera?

Trump's authoritarian designs for ruling the government by consolidating power through the first and third branches of government is a very real threat.This is going to sound like a conspiracy theory, but bear with me please. Curtis Yarvin is a philosopher behind a lot of these allies of Trump. Peter Thiel who funded Vance's entire venture capital fund and much of his SuperPAC senate bid had this guy over multiple times at his home. Thiel believes Social Security and Medicare are wastes of money and should be eliminated. Yarvin and Steve Bannon, the convicted man very close with Trump, are both friends and held frequent contact with Bannon's office while he was working at the White House. Elon Musk and Yarvin are known through Peter Thiel. A lot of the Silicon Valley techbro political movement all subscribe to Yarvin's ideas.What does Yarvin believe? He believes in a monarchy as what America should become. Corporations should take over functions of much of the government and make their own rules and laws. He writes endlessly that liberal democracy is a failure and that only authoritarianism can guide America in the 21st century. He is extremely popular with the billionaire and multi-millionaire tech class of people from these last 20 years. This is all real and seems too crazy to be true, yet it is. Why would Thiel associate with someone so out of his mind? Yarvin has spoken that the elite are better than everyone else, and that the working class are meant to be ruled by their betters. He has also written about there being a \\"natural slave\\" class of people and that slavery had a purpose throughout history. I recommend reading about this. There are multiple news stories throughout the decade and tons of podcasts and literature online written by him or with his appearances. He is probably the most important philosopher of today that nobody has heard of. He's all over the evangelical movement trying to create theocratic state governments.","title":"Union Leader: Its Time for the Democrats to Wake Up"},{"text":"Well, elections have consequences, and I hope they work out for them.This Mike Huckabee business might suggest otherwise, though.","title":"Its Not Like There Werent Chances to Do This Differently Dearborn, Michigan, turned against Kamala Harris decisively.

There are strippers and full service workers who feel that way as well. All types of sex work happen on a spectrum and exist in their own unique context including external environmental factors and personal factors shaping the experience of that individual.  \\n  \\nWhen people emphasize those types of experiences, they are trying to combat the blanket statements and universal claims often made about sex work. Sex work is a huge, huge umbrella term. It is very difficult to generalize about. It requires a lot of nuance. \\n  \\nEmpowerment and harm are personal feelings/experiences. It doesnt really seem to fair to deny someone accurately characterizing *their* experience due to the experiences of others, does it? It also wouldnt be fair to apply ones personal experience to the entire concept of sex work, either, because it would ignore the people who have very negative experiences. So calling it any one thing is always wrong. \\n  \\nOne of the reasons people keep comparing it to other work is because there are always different situations that could make something uniquely good or uniquely bad. But most of the time the idea of someone doing a job is neutral. \\n  \\nYou seem to be latched onto the negative experiences and unable to accept that there are others and come to a neutral general view.

Everyone but Warren and Biden dropped out right before Super Tuesday. Pete was outperforming Biden at the time and he dropped (then later gets a cabinet position, seems very legitimate). They knew Bernie could win if they didn't all coalesce around Biden so everyone but Warren - the candidate closest to Bernie - dropped out. It was so obviously manipulated.

Like is it intimate, yea. However, the arguments against sex work bridge on puritan ideals - for example, plenty of people have hookups and one night stands without developing that emotional connection. People have friends with benefits and booty calls that aren't sex workers without the romantic connection or emotional connection. Hell, there's married couples where one or the other feels sex is just a chore that gets done sometimes. Like I don't care about sex all that much, I'm asexual but I've observed people and even tried both long and short term relationships. It was fun, sure, but there is a difference between sex with a long term romantic partner, sex with a friend who you have sex with sometimes, and a one night stand. All of them are fun and I can see why people enjoy sex! But the one night stand didn't cheapen the experience of the long term relationships. The FWB didn't mean the ONS was more intimate or the romantic relationship was less so. Your beliefs around sex are your beliefs, but unless you're against all sex outside of romantic relationships, you're judging more than just sex workers. You're judging the entire hookup scene.","title":"cmv: The girl-bossification of sex work is not the feminist take people think it is."},{"text":"Ram them through!!

Miriam-Webster defines a coward as \\"one who shows disgraceful fear or timidity.\\" According to the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, a coward is?a person who lacks the courage or bravery to do things that others consider to be ordinary.? In colloquial usage, \\"coward\\" is used in a disapproving way. \\"Fear\\" is an ordinary human response. In every action or inaction, we make strive to accomplish a positive outcome or avoid a negative consequence for ourselves or others. All of us make choices out of fear everyday. A \\"coward\\" is used to describe a person who makes a shameful choice in response to their fear. \\"Shame\\" is a mutable emotion that depends and exists entirely in social contexts. You can feel like a coward, and you can call yourself a coward, but whether you are a coward depends entirely on how your choices compare to the choices that society expects of a similar person in similar circumstances. Just because you pity those who are abused does not make them exempt from reality. Victims of abuse don't need pity. They often need empathy and support. That doesn't mean they are beyond reproach or accountability. I've met many victims who feel the way this dude does - unwilling to manage their humiliation and resentment, expecting others to accommodate their self-loathing. The rest of your comment is an interesting take. The assumption that this topic makes me \\"uncomfortable\\", \\"squeamish\\", or that I haven't \\"actually endured something in reality\\" is entertaining to say the least.

Positivity implies something good, but the qualifier toxic is meant to point to the potential dangerous at worst or useless, even delusional at best forms of positivity that people would otherwise not question because of our prior assumptions about what positivity means.The issue for me is that, we see negativity and typically know it when we see it and have more tools to deal with it. Toxic positivity, ironically, is sometimes a response to this negativity, but it can be insidious because we don't have as many tools to deal with it or even spot the dangers of it. The framework of which is better or worse isn't one I personally find useful. I would argue instead that it's helpful to be able to recognize and name things for the reasons I stated above.

For all the finger-pointing at 'wokeness' for losing the '24 election, there's [reason to believe](https://www.niskanencenter.org/how-does-the-public-move-right-when-policy-moves-left/) voters are just contrary about social policy. Come '28, they even transgender rights could be mainstream. Anyone who says they won't vote for a Democrat because he's gay probably wouldn't vote for a Democrat anyway.","title":"CMV: Pete Buttigieg should not run in the 2028 primary"},{"text":"Dementia and crack dont mix.","title":"TDS-Riddled Pelosi Absurdly Claims 'Fewer' Illegal Aliens Entered the US Under Biden Than Trump"},{"text":"Thats only a dealbreaker for a small percentage of people that will never vote for a Dem anyway.

Biden was not the communicator-in-chief that Democrats needed across the country to spread their message of successes. Successes that need to be seized upon and continued to fight on behalf of all working Americans.Saying the IRA and other major pieces of passed legislation helped create jobs and raise incomes with slogans or broad statements doesn't instill in working-class people a personally identifiable narrative that drives voters and nonvoters to want to get involved at a grassroots level. There is a reason why Bill Clinton and Obama were both so incredibly effective at spreading their message to workers. They took lessons learned from FDR on how to speak to common people about common issues in ways that help people conceptualize the impacts of their policy agendas. They aren't afraid to speak off-the-cuff. The use of stories, history, and experience to guide a listener into the mind and thoughts of a citizen makes them feel tethered to the earth in a way that is more powerful than the current corporatist DNC status quo. Relying on paid celebrity endorsements, social media influencer campaigns, and so many other mistakes taken to try and rewrite the rules failed to spread the messages of success.Most Americans don't care about insulin prices. Most Americans care about groceries, so have a story ready next time for how you are going to break up monopolies or oligopolies that price competition out of markets.

You still put up with daily abuse from men. Daily time wasters, stalkers, etc. Its sex work in general. I have an 11 year old niece. If she ever made the notion that she would get into sex work, I would absolutely tell her NOT WORTH IT. What I didn't mention is the fact that my working partner was murdered in 2006. Her body was found on the river bank. Her killer was never caught. She had children and a husband. She was a great friend. She worked as an escort, on the streets with me. Back in 2018, I was caught up iin a sting by the cops but not to bust us workers but to gather information. In my current province of Alberta in Canada, we have an active serial killer who targets sex workers. We believe its a guy named Pat Carson who lives on a rural property near Edmonton. When I was talking to the officers, they mentioned that there's a serial killler and that they were desperately trying to get him. They took my information like pics of my scars and tattoo. My profile and full body pics. My dentists name for my dental records. Just in case I am murdered and may have to ID my body. THAT is the reality of sex work. This is the shit no one wants to talk about because its too awful. This is what the johns don't want to accept because they don't want to admit to being part of the problem. They are part of the problem though. Most people do this out of need, not want. These guys absolutely do create major issues for workers. Honestly, most guys that I dealt with were straight up trash. Even some of the regulars. At the end of the day, they don't see as a human, they see us as a release. Yes, there were some good guys but 98% were just trash. I'm not going to sugarcoat this. Now I absolutely do not hate men. I've met a lot of amazing guys over the years, though almost none in relation to sex work. I am afraid of all men though.

Again, latin countries have been voting female presidents into office for years now, so maybe there is more to it than that if you're willing to broaden your thinking.a couple key messaging misses I can see with this last election:On immigration:  Too many people automatically assume that latino VOTERS are happy with the status quo at the border because all latinos have the same backgrounds right?  For those who immigrated and attained citizenship legally, there is a mindset of \\"I worked my ass of for this why should they get a pass\\".  Also, most people who are ok with the status quo of the border live nowhere near it, whereas hispanic neighborhoods along the border are living in it.  Look at the voting patterns of heavily hispanic border towns.  Many of them flipped from red from 2020-2024Latino voters are a living breathing part of the american working class.  They feel their incomes lagging behind inflation and the quality of life diminishing while grinding away.  And the lower your income is, the more damaging the effects of inflation has been.  It's unfair to fully place inflationary trends on the Biden administration, but as is usually the case, an administration is judged by the economy they oversee.  Kamala did not do a good enough job separating herself from Biden, nor did she do an adequate enough of a job emphasizing the policies that would enrich the working class that has been battered by inflation.   You need a better answer than \\"check my website for my economic policy \\" because if it is a core tenant of your campaign, you would lead with it.

Like Senators were still somewhat influential, they held some power over administration and judicial procedure. In practice this was sort of power over what the Emperor didn't notice though, if the Emperor took pretty much any position publically and formally, it became impossible to oppose him. If the senator endorsed a bill, dissenting senators would in almost all cases at most absent themselves from the vote.This was of course natural, because under the principate senators were basically appointed at the will of the Emperor. Obviously it is difficult to vote against a guy who can just remove you from office if you do. This was actually a slow devolution in procedure over time, really. The original plan had essentially been that the Censor of the Republic was tasked with estimating the wealth of all the citizens. This was necessary for the function of the Centuriate assembly (which divided the population unequally into 100 units based on wealth, and have citizens vote in a weird sort of weighted direct democracy - it's kind of absurdly complicated), as well as the senate, which was simply composed of the richest ~600 men. The censors job here was theoretically *administrative* - he was supposed to estimate citizens wealth in good faith.Obviously, by the late republic, this was not really the case. The censors became corrupt and regularly would rig the process to favor one party or another politically. Falsely claiming an allied politician to be wealthy enough to get in, or whatever. Caesar, in his reforms, consolidated the position with himself as sole censor, and was entirely arbitrary in his role such that the senate became a body essentially appointed by one man. And Augustus inherited that power, and after that the power simply became an inherited (or fought for) thing. I'm sure after a while the Emperor ceased even bothering to fabricate justification for his appointments and removals.","title":"47 demands Senate let him appoint cabinet nominees without a vote, bypassing confirmation process"},{"text":"Does going to a spa discount the intimacy of having a partner give you a massage?Does going to a restaurant discount the emotions or intimacy of a home cooked dinner?","title":"cmv: The girl-bossification of sex work is not the feminist take people think it is."},{"text":"It literally happened in 2008 and 2012.

I will even go a step a further its when networks/pundits plucked Trump from the Wack Pack on Howard Stern's show(this is a fact look it up) to call in to their shows and blather on about his 'birther' movement. They would have him on as comic relief and to be poked fun at - no one took this guy seriously.(with good reason)in 2011, Lally Weymouth(Katherine Graham's daughter Publisher of WashingtonPost) a journalist who hosted the WhiteHouse Correspondence Dinner invited Trump to the dinner to yet again be a target for jokes. Obama's team saw he was on the attendees list and wrote some bangers that really got under Trump's skin - and it was blasted on every news outlet since that ran stories on his birth certificate conspiracy years earlier. It was at that point we jumped the Trump shark.Trump fueled by seething embarrassment decides to run for president and was OVERCOVERED because he was already known by the networks of saying wild outlandish lies that when they pushed those out on their channels would get more eyeballs. For most of his 2015 campaign again it was covered as 'can you believe this guy would even run, WHO WOULD VOTE FOR HIM?' meanwhile he got 4x the media coverage as all other candidates which catapulted him ahead of everyone else.So in the end the news media becomes a huge profit center when Trump is around because people tune in to watch his antics. This paves the way to the white house and regardless if its Fox, OAN, MSNBC or CNN they all LOVE TRUMP because it gets us to watch their news. He is like a 9/11 that happens every day for them... they thrive on fear mongering to keep us watching. Fox actually loses its position when Trump is in office with more mainstream news channels find themselves with a larger audience to see what the crazy man did today.  \\n  \\nThis is all 100% fact and it reads like an origin story of a comic book villain.","title":"Demonstrators wave Nazi flags outside local theater performance of The Diary of Anne Frank in Michigan"},{"text":"Someone should tell Joe.\\nhttps://www.axios.com/2021/01/21/biden-fire-staffers-disrespecting-others\\n\\"Im not joking when I say this: If youre ever working with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect, talk down to someone, I promise you I will fire you on the spot.?

I include the stuff about inclusivity because, one on one, the actual way to get consrevatives to listen to you and like you is throw everyone furhter left of you under the bus, concede a few points, and then argue aggressively without backing down - which at first leads them to eventually insult you, and then later they compliment you to everyone they know (which is ?? to me but has been so weirdly consistent).I would argue that a key part of the Young Right Wing Men phenomenon is not \\"Us low statuses need to stick together\\", but the promise that being a Young Right Wing Man will *lead to* the high status you've been denied. Low Status Solidarity is something you see in left wing circles, and while right wingers will definitely have a major grievance with being Looked Down Upon, the things that trigger their sense of being Looked Down On are much more minor because many of them already think of themselves as being at higher status.The other point is, the way the right has been labelled low status has been on a moral basis. And they've used that to argue, seemingly successfully, to many young men a kind of Nietzschean \\"Okay, but we're not low status in the way that matters, because we work out and get cars and laid and respect men\\". That's why I specifically argue to attack *that* form of status and *not* focus on the moral side.The prescriptive for how you should interact one on one with people of a certain side, and the prescriptive for what kind of narratives would be good to push into the etherk, are, I think, different things.(This is part of the cost of this post originally having been written for another subreddit).","title":"Social Systems win Culture Wars - here's how liberals and you (you personally!) can win the next one."},{"text":"Fewer illegal aliens per the traditional definition, but the current administration exponentially increased foreigners claiming to be refugees and asylum seekers allowed into our country waiting to be processed.","title":"TDS-Riddled Pelosi Absurdly Claims 'Fewer' Illegal Aliens Entered the US Under Biden Than Trump"},{"text":"Help us understand what those are now that the election has been stolen by oligarchs, state governors, the Supreme Court, senate and congress.","title":"Cheney: Guardrails of democracy must keep Trump in check"},{"text":"Donald Trump won because 25% of the American public either isnt aware of how corrupt he was during his first term and the damage he did, *or* theyre fully aware, but voting for him hurt the libs, so it was worth it.","title":"Not even Taylor Swift could help Kamala Harris secure the presidency.

How to do it - is actually a lot easier than you think, considering how the republic operates.  \\n  \\nAs you know, the US conducts a census every 10 years. The next one is in 2030. When the census is conducted, the US counts ALL residents regardless of citizenship, aka everyone who lives in a particular dwelling. What does it do? In a nutshell:  \\n1. Determines congressional representation  \\n2. Affects federal funding distribution  \\n3. Provides demographic data  \\n4.

Because the number of US Representatives in the House is fixed at 435, the state with an increased population gains Representatives and the state that has lost population decreases the number of Representatives. So, the House has now changed.  \\n\\\\- The Electoral College votes are calculated as follows: The number of US House of Representatives + the number of State Senators (always 2)= the Number of Electoral College votes. So, the electoral votes have also changed.  \\n  \\nPolitical strategy theory suggests this creates a potential political shift:  \\n\\\\- New residents may favor policies similar to those in place when they arrived  \\n\\\\- They might support continued immigration policies that allow family reunification.  \\n\\\\- This could influence both LOCAL and NATIONAL election outcomes  \\n\\\\- Over time, this might shift the electoral balance in certain states","title":"Why did Biden open the floodgates down south?"},{"text":"What I got from this is that we need to adopt a more populist messaging but we can keep our same policies.

I know there are a lot of intellectuals in this camp, and no one wants to make anyone feel dumb, but the general education of the broader electorate, especially rural is not a college level.1. Concepts need to be broken down and presented in easy to understand explanations. Not in a degrading studip way, but knowing that your target education level is likely 6-8th grade. Tariffs are a very clear indicator where this would have made an impact if they had just sound byted Tarriffs get paid by the American importer, not the Chinese exporter!2. That and they need to do better about drawing out basic moral dilemmas of right and wrong in distilled examples that easily highlight a moral hypocrisy. Kamala did better at this in what little time she had, but they have to do better here.3. They need to be direct with the electorate and not talk around or above topics. Being clear, concise, and direct. Tim Waltz did a good job here with what time he had.4. They need to be bold to embrace ideas that will make material impact to the pocket of the blue collar (non-union) worker. 5. They need to stop working with bad faith actors on bills, and stand their ground more united. This may be a death knell at this point with how much has been lost, but we are being gamed by constantly taking the high road and conceding too much instead of pressing true compromise.6.

Neither would their children have citizenship, and so on, and so on.It is truly disgusting to think these people believe they have a right to issue an implementation of the constitution, which implements it in a way, not only simply being interpreted differently than it's purpose, but interpreted in such a way as to render its purpose completely impossible. It would essentially make the law similar to the way it was under Dredd Scott, where certain categories of irredeemable bloodline cursed inherent aliens were assumed to exist.

The occupational hazards of one profession don't justify the hazards of another. My point was that the *existence of occupational hazards is not a disqualifier for the validity of that occupation.*If anything, I'd argue you're falling into fallacious thinking. That prostitution has historically been considered a vulgar profession and is even outlawed in most modern nations is not in itself proof that it actually *is* vulgar. This is an appeal to normality - that social norms dictate the ethicality of a thing. I'd also point out that many professions, though not illegal, are also not held in high social regard, and depending on where one lives, may carry serious social consequences. Plenty of parents want their kids to be lawyers and doctors; not so many want their kids to be sewage workers and burger flippers. The dalit caste in India was and is gatekept from higher-paying, socially-respectable jobs precisely because there are jobs considered too unclean or disreputable for higher-caste people to be caught dead doing, even when those jobs are (A) necessary, and (B) not illegal.And to your last point, that dangerous work shouldn't be seen as empowering, I hope you don't work for the US military's marketing team, because they're gonna fire your ass for talking like that. The career of \\"soldier\\" is not only *wildly* unethical (given that its central, even defining characteristic is that of being a state-sanctioned murderer), it's extremely dangerous to the health of the people who do the job. *And yet* it's pushed as a noble, even honorable profession: to serve and protect the state is its own reward. People don't laugh at those ads pushed by the USAF, USMC, USA, USN, or Coast Guard - if they think they're problematic at all, they're probably too horrified to laugh.There are certainly problems with prostitution as a profession, but most of them could be at least regulated by pulling it out of the criminal underworld. Ignoring how it has helped bring more people into the profession, the advent of OnlyFans changed the course of many professionals' careers simply because it enabled them to take their work into their own hands. Some pornstars still make porn, but don't engage with major studios like Brazzers or Bangbros at all because the occupational hazards they faced were not the result of being a pornstar, but instead the result of working for *them*. And truthfully, I don't see it as especially problematic for women or men to view it as empowering when sex is a source of shame and trauma for so many. Holding a sexual partner at the door, putting out a hand and saying, \\"This much, or nothing at all for you,\\" *is* exerting a form of power over someone - the power of a seller.","title":"cmv: The girl-bossification of sex work is not the feminist take people think it is."},{"text":"Seems there are a few of us.

The prevalence of PTSD, BPD, substance abuse, childhood sexual abuse and violence, etc., is substantially higher for those who choose to go into sex work.Sex work itself can significantly exacerbate these issues through an increased exposure to violence, abuse, and psychological traumas, while also inherently promoting maladaptive coping mechanisms affecting self-esteem, personal relationships, emotional dependency, self-medication, and avoidance behaviors. Rates of PTSD, depression, anxiety, addiction, dissociative disorders, self-harm, etc., for those in sex work are all pretty drastically increased in comparison to other professions.I'd also say there is a pretty significant difference in the emotional labor required in sex work compared to the service industry. The emotional interactions in sex work are not subject to the same restrictive norms in place in the service industry, and the emotional and physical intimacy required in comparison seems like reason enough to warrant a distinction. I don't think the bodily autonomy arguments carry much weight.There's also the difficulty in transitioning out of sex work that distinguishes it from other professions. There are financial and emotional difficulties involved that frequently lead people back into it.","title":"cmv: The girl-bossification of sex work is not the feminist take people think it is."},{"text":"major moobs!","title":"Melania Trump Is Expected to Snub White House Visit With Jill Biden"},{"text":"Eggs too!

Meanwhile actual studies show that married people of all types around the world are happier: https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w20794/w20794.pdfRunning a regression on the happiness data shows that women are actually the greater beneficiary over men.The inclusion of lagged life satisfaction as an independent variable lowers the coefficient on 8 being married slightly from 0.480 to 0.427 and the inclusion of the previous life satisfaction lowers the coefficient to 0.347. In both cases, the effect still remains significant at the 0.1% level and the difference between singles and those who are living as couple but unmarried is approximately three quarters of the difference between singles and married individuals. The inclusion of within-sample changes in life satisfaction lowers the estimated effects of marriage, and perhaps excessively so, as noted above. Hence the estimates including only the initial life satisfaction as a personality control are probably more appropriate. Model 4 is equivalent to Model 2 with the inclusion of the interaction term to cover the difference between men and women in the well-being effect of marriage. This model shows that the life satisfaction impact of marriage is 0.161 higher for females than males. This effect is significant at the 5% level.   The estimates of the average well-being effects of marriage may include some unhappy years that precede separation and divorce. Thus, the long-term well-being difference between the never married and those who stay married may be greater than the above would suggest.","title":"CMV: Sex Strikes and the General 4B movement is ineffective.

Harris' loss was probably not primarily due to her identity, so I don't think it necessarily says that \\"the country is not ready for X type of President\\". What voters actually said was their top concerns were the economy and immigration, issues she was particularly weak on due to her association with the current unpopular administration. Are there some sizeable chunk of voters that don't want a woman or LGBT person to be President? Sure, but those are people who are never going to be in the Democratic coalition.Some people will think this is naive, but most voters are good people who just want prosperity for their friends, families and country.

You dont need to leave your own home, you work on your own schedule, you set your own prices, you are your own boss. You just whack a dildo in there and mess about, or whatever they do on OF, and go get lunch. There is no problem with having any income from non-contact OF because it doesnt involve any touching of another human being at all. So non-contact sex work is just another job imoContact sex work is different. What makes it different? The risk involvedThe thing that makes sex work risky is its lack of legal protections, lack of support by police, and lack of workers rights. The only reason there are pimps for sex work and not for an equally in-demand service like IT technicians is that a man can snatch you off the street or groom you or whatever and pimp you out as a prostitute but not as an IT technicianThere are always nutjob customers but the only thing that makes prostitution less safe than shopkeeping is its lack of regulation and protection in law. A fully regulated sex industry would have all the checks youd expect from any other profession and all the protection too. You could have an equal risk profile for a prostitute or a bartender if prostitution wasnt treated differently So the danger with contact sex work is the lack of legal protection, which is only like that because of europes puritanical/religious past still haunting western civilisation 500 years later. Other than our outdated shaming of sex and sexual activities there is no reason why we dont treat prostitution like a job, and that is entirely the reason why its dangerousWho is the safest contact sex worker? The self employed prostitute. What helps prostitutes become self employed? Onlyfans. If you are controlling the talent you film with, accepting the jobs you want and denying the jobs you dont want, then you are maximally in control of your career as a contact sex worker. Meaning the online platforms are massively helpful for allowing modern prostitutes to protect themselves betterThere are people who argue onlyfans doesnt empower women because they pay a percentage like 20% to the platform. This is only the same as being on ebay or amazon or etsy. You can either be a shop in a busy mall and pay 20% fees to the mall in return for generating your footfall, or you can be a shop in the middle of nowhere and have to generate all of your own customers. So the onlyfans fee is a great deal and not dis-empowering to women at all. It is just a marketing costSo onlyfans makes non-contact careers way more viable, reducing the amount of people who need to become contact sex workers in the industry; it empowers the sex worker and gives them far more control than they would have in an offline equivalent; and it gives much more safety and choice to those contact sex workers who use it, than if they were offline prostitutes. It is massively helpful to womenThe only aspect that isnt empowering is that it is sex work which is viewed by society as dehumanising and less than other work. The part that makes it dangerous, though, is not sex work itself but the lack of legal protections","title":"cmv: The girl-bossification of sex work is not the feminist take people think it is."},{"text":"I dont think theres a person out there who does NOT have a take on what went wrong.I dont think its as deep as a lot of the analyst are saying.

People do go into sex work as when they have other options available. My girlfriend and i started doing only fans and cam streams because we wanted to travel and it seemed worth it. We had a blast and the whole thing was a lot of fun. You can acctually have a lot of control. In cam streaming you set your prices before hand, we looked through other peoples menus to get an idea. You can block people that annoy you, you dont have to steo outside your comfort zone, and it can really boost your self esteem. Neither of us thought we were attractive but we figured wed give it a go because it seemed easy. Were also swingers, that is to say, we dont place a whole lot of value on sex anyways and we were getting paid to have sex with eachother so the whole thing was pretty cool. We have a dom and sub dynamic but she is the dom and shot caller, i just like trying to make her happy. We only stopped because it was inconsistent, much in thhe same way waiting tables is inconsistent. Shes brought it up a couple of times but as things stand now we simply dont have time. I agree sex work shouldnt be glorified, but it can be posotive. I dont think prostitution can be a posotive experience but if and cam work certainly can. I also had a friend who since middle school said they wanted to be a pornstar and they are now. Tbh i think thats more sad than anything, it seems like a crappy dream. I can however say that she seems happy. Whether she really is i do not know. Shes the reason i dont think sex work should be glorified.  However, sex work was also her first choice. Her grades werent bad for some reason she just decided its what she wanted to do. Thats two examples of people choosing some form of sex work when they do have other options.

The landscape is going to be different in 2028, it's hard to predict who emerges and what the issues seem to be. Buttigieg is a good communicator and has a good resume, and he's a white man, so he's got that going for him. Trump can't run again, so it's probably going to Vance hating cat ladies as his platform, he's got no charisma.
