Was hoping some folks here could steer me the right direction with this question.The Affordable Care Act, to my understanding, means healthy people pay in via individual mandate (no longer mandatory federally, but mandatory in CA, RI, NJ, MA, DC, and still a popular option from what I see) and that lessens the burden when people (often old or chronically ill) need treatment more regularly than healthy people.What I'm wondering is, is there a way to do this on a statewide level? If certain states wanted to set up a statewide healthcare coverage system for their own state (perhaps alongside the federal ACA or to safeguard against its sabotage by the GOP) is it legal? Or is it something that'd be struck down by federal courts (interstate commerce?), or would be lobbied too hard against by insurance companies, or is there just a fear that it'd be too electorally unpopular or drive people away from the state due to cost of living?I remember that in 2012 Romney had to dodge critics that said the ACA was based on something done during his time in Massachusetts. While a statewide ACA would be a hard measure in a swing state, you'd think that a state like CA (solidly Dem) would give it a try. Or maybe a smaller state like DE and MD which (1) is solid Dem, (2) is not going to see people move away to other states due to COL increases, (3) probably pays more $ in per capita than they receive back from the federal govt- as opposed to states facing poverty like MS or WV.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 23, 2024"},{"text":"Dems need to fight tooth and nail against Trumps plans.

Death sentence saving tax payer dollars) and potentially misleading information around whether or not Biden can commute sentences in appeal status. The law vs what is actually done seems to be different. I don't have the time to do indepth research, but I encourage everyone to do their own research. Do not take my comment as gospel and do not quote me. Do your own research and come to your conclusion as reddit comments can be wrong!I can't speak for the other 37 cases that were commuted by Biden, but for those frustrated he didn't do all 40...heres a small summary for the 3 excluded:1. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev - Boston marathon bomber. He is still in the middle of an appeal process for whether the jury/prosecution fumbled the case due to the amount of public press it received. So, his sentence over the death sentence is still under appeal and therefore Biden likely couldn't commute a death sentence still under review. 2. Dylann Roof - church shooter in 2015 that killed 9 people. The Supreme Court denied the appeal. So, either Roof's lawyers are trying again and they're still in appeal review or there is no more room left for them but I could be wrong. If Biden commuted his sentence, it would be against the Supreme courts decision to deny his appeal. Therefore, likely Biden sees the death penalty is warranted due to the Supreme courts decisions or they are still in the middle of another appeal. 3.  Robert Bowers - killed 11 and injured 7 after a synagogue shooting in 2018. His last appeal in 2023 for a new trial was denied. He likely is appealing to a higher court and still waiting.I don't obviously understand all of the ins and outs for commuting the death sentence, but it appears as though, in these 3 cases, the president either feels these 3 deserve the death penalty or they are still waiting for a final appeal review and he can't commute their sentence yet","title":"Joe Biden commutes sentences of 37 out of 40 federal death row inmates"},{"text":"What's more weird is she apparently didn't have any staff answering constituents' emails and calls, doing the other tasks of a elected representative, and *nobody noticed*.Texas, is anybody home?","title":"Texas Rep.

Immediate ?hangmans fracture, and their neck snaps. However, that still isnt an instant death, either. All it does is break the nervous connection between the head and rest of the body. It doesnt immediately cause unconsciousness. Typically, this kind of method causes asphyxiation, with death resulting from a lack of oxygenated blood in the brain, but that can *still* take up to 3 minutes. There have been numerous accounts of executed (whether legally, or extrajudicially) individuals continuing to make deliberate facial expressions, grimacing in pain, etc.Rope too long: yeah. Their head can come the entire way tf off. Its functionally a guillotining by rope. Also has the same issue as the previous, although at least this way the blood loss is quicker. Much ?oopsiesAnd finally, the last one- rope not properly fitted around the persons neck: the rope slips from around their head, and they fall unimpeded to the ground, potentially breaking a leg.

Trump won because he is a rich guy who is masterful at speaking to working class people despite actively disliking them and thinking theyre rubes. The modal r/neoliberal user (and democrat if Im honest) is either incapable or unwilling to hide that contempt and appeal to that electorate compared to Trump. Another reason is that (and idk if this is downstream of this subs gender composition), but the modal user is completely unwilling to engage with the inherent emotionality of voting. When you treat electioneering as an optimization exercise, you forget how much of it comes down to vibes and sentiment. Trump has very little active policy but he evokes strong feelings in both his supporters and detractors. Ultimately, though, these two problems synthesize into a unique third problem: language. Because this sub is oriented toward policy that most immediately advantages upper-middle class people, and because its users are unwilling or unable to appeal to the emotions of voters, these preferences crystallize into shibboleths that not only fail to land with the median voter, they actually turn them off.

As someone who is very well-versed about the death penalty (and as someone who personally doesnt support it), one of the roadblocks in discussing its use is that a lot of people dont understand what commute means/what a commutation is. Ive run so often into people where, when I mention the prospect of commuting a death sentence, their response is something like, Would you want them to move in next door to you and your family, then?! Because theyre operating under the assumption that lessening a death sentence means that person will be released from prison. That is not what it means; it means the person WILL die in prison just the same, but not by means of execution.And a lot of people worry that a death sentence commutation will eventually lead to a release, but that was far more common in the past than it has been in the modern, post-1972-moratorium era of the death penalty. Nowadays, when it comes to murder cases, life without parole always means life without parole. (In fact, some LWOP sentences are conditional on the inmate never pursuing appeals or pardons again - like, assuredly, they are NEVER getting out.) No ones getting out to continue being a menace to society if their sentence is commuted.

The best ally for the Dem Party going forward is Trump himself. If he actually does the things he says he wants to do, then it should lead to real, tangible negative economic consequences. His cabinet nominees are mostly unqualified loyalists. A failed Trump admin in years 1 and 2 will open the door for Dems to retake the house and senate. Dems could then argue that Trump inherited a strengthened economy and promptly tanked it with his P2025 policies. Icing on the cake? Several issues: RFK, Jr mis-management of the health dept and promotion of his anti-vax conspiracies that lead to measles outbreaks among children. Any smack-down by SCOTUS because of how outrageous Trumps claims are. Frankly, if SCOTUS is truly just another MAGA/Trump lapdog, then the country is toast anyway. And finally, anything coming from Putin if he finally decides he wants to cause chaos by exposing Trump in some way. Butits the economy, stupid. Nothing else mattered in 2024.

Situated on land adjacent to the Berryburn substation and existing transmission infrastructure, the proposed Corshellach Energy Storage System secured consent for its development from the Moray Council Planning and Regulatory Services Committee. RES applied for planning permission in mid-July. The BESS will provide grid reliability services by storing energy when generation exceeds demand and then releasing it back onto the network when demand exceeds generation. The duration of the BESS has not been revealed. The projects location also means that little additional infrastructure is required to connect it to the grid network, limiting any potential environmental impacts. The construction phase of the project will take approximately 12 months, and RES will employ local contractors and employees. Commenting on the approval, Mile Amsbury-Savage, development project manager for RES, highlighted the urgency of energy storage deployment to help stabilise the grid and support the aims of the UK governments newly released Clean Power 2030 Action Plan. BESS will be crucial in supporting Scotlands net-zero emissions target. Just days after the UK government unveiled its Clean Power 2030 Action Plan, we are pleased to welcome Moray Councils positive decision, which allows Corshellach Battery Energy Storage System to play its part in managing the increasingly complex supply and demand needs, Amsbury-Savage said. RES has developed over 830MW of energy storage projects across the UK and Ireland and is currently managing over 600MW of operational storage projects. As reported by Solar Power Portal yesterday (17 December), the organisation secured an asset management contract for a 70MW solar-plus-storage project near Bristol. RES already provides operation and maintenance services to the solar PV power plant and has been its asset manager for around a year. It will now also manage the BESS to oversee its operational performance. In contrast to Moray Councils acceptance of the BESS development, earlier this year, RES saw Torridge District Council reject a planning application for the proposed 49.9MW Stoneworthy Energy Storage project in Devon. RES was not the only renewable energy developer facing planning headaches. Low Carbon was previously denied planning permission for a 30MW solar PV plant by Wiltshire Council, with objectors citing concerns surrounding potential harm to local waterways and the location of 50% of the project on the best and most versatile agricultural land.!ping ECO&amp;UK","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Espically since Sweden hasnt had a deaths penalty for centuries.

If you have a family heirloom thats been passed down for generations and is valued at $1 million, but the family is not a wealthy family, that heirloom is only worth a million to them if they sell it. The tax system is based on the wherewithal to pay, meaning the tax follows the money. For example, a company makes $100, it would owe $20 in tax on that income. But if they have an employee and they paid them $50 with that $100, then the company would pay tax on their $50 and the employee would pay tax on their $50. Similarly, if you hold a stock, you paid tax on the income you used to buy it, but you wont pay tax on the amount its appreciated until you sell it, because thats when youd have the cash to pay it. Many inheritances arent liquid, so there isnt cash to pay the tax and often keeping the asset itself is more important to the person receiving it, imposing a tax on it would force them to sell it. If you limit the tax to just cash, the people who have that kind of cash would find a way to transfer it as something else to avoid the tax and they could afford to hire a good tax advisor.","title":"CMV: Inheritance tax is morally consistent with conservative values"},{"text":"I think it's okay to kiss on public transport so long as one of you maintains constant vigilance against people who want to pour gasoline over you and set you on fire","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I think it should be controlled by a country that scores at least a 9 in The Economist Democracy Index. ??","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/yqr1752e7l8e1.jpeg?width=839&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=958e00d3c01499fa84d9d4a1d9ff0ea2388386ad","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"They're going to adx Florence","title":"Joe Biden commutes sentences of 37 out of 40 federal death row inmates"},{"text":"Struggling to see how Luigi Mangione is a terrorist in any way.","title":"Joe Biden commutes sentences of 37 out of 40 federal death row inmates"},{"text":"nwo plans keep failing.","title":"Is there a chance of another pandemic in 2025?"},{"text":"In Lithuania it was diametrally opposite:The first is a Social Democratic outright majority in the governmentConservative majority done that in 1998.The second is the collapse of a right wing dictatorship.After collapse of left wing Soviet dictatorship.","title":"Biden gives life in prison to 37 of 40 federal death row inmates so Trump cant have them executed"},{"text":"We arent talking about what-ifs and hypotheticals.Im talking about this one specific thing where a person gunned down a ceo on the streets of NY.The CEO was one or two degrees of influence away from contributing from the deaths of countless people and plunging countless more into life changing debt.The person who murdered them in the streets did a lesser crime compared to the CEO even if they are both murderers.

Trump also had high deportations but he was not cost-effective because he hired far more border agents while squeezing just a few more deportations.?But Trump does have some wild plans that will severely back fire. First, he will wrestle with Congress, and ultimately the Supreme Court, for deploying the military. Second, once people actually see the National Guard and the Army on roads and highways, they will become resistant and infuriated with the over-complicated system.

I've been trying to crack the liber primus lately. Shit's insane!!It's interesting that you posted this because I was just debating shelving this project for a bit.See here's the thing. I'm a computer scientist and I'm absolutely fascinated by stuff like this. I stumbled across this puzzle again a few months ago and decided to take a crack at it.Just last night I hit a massive wall and am honestly wondering if it's a massive hoax. Let me tell you why.I specialize in AI and work with large data sets all the time. So I applied my skills to cracking the liber primus. I literally wrote a 600 line program in C++ that brute forces the first line of every section with every possible decryption technique I could find. It applies over 200 decryption options to a single line to try and break it. It uses every permutation of cryptographic techniques I could find and is working with a set of 75 possible keywords that have been pulled from the translated pages of the text.I fed every first page of the liber primus sections through this program and manually checked the literally thousands of possible options that it output.With this powerful software I wasn't able to crack a single word of this text. Like..... There are literally no other decryption techniques that I know of. I just brute forced this thing with every permutation of Caesar, atbash, and viginere cypher decryption techniques I could think of.Not a single fucking word was cracked. Not a single one.This isn't ego. This isn't me saying \\"if I can't crack it no one else can.\\" What I'm saying is that as far as I can tell mathematically there are literally no other options to try. Like we can calculate how many possible options there are using a Cartesian product that way we don't miss a single option and can try all of them. To the best of my cryptographic knowledge I've done that here.The only thing I can think of is that it uses keywords for decryption that are not associated with the text at all. If the keywords were in the translated pages I would have found it and tried it by now since I pulled all relevant words and phrases for decryption mostly from there. And if the keys are just random words not associated with the text or any other hint then there's pretty much no way to crack it. There are too many words in the English language to Brute force it that way.So.... If anyone from Cicada is reading this.... Help a dude out. It's been ten years and nobody's cracked it.

One thing I like about American faculty is that they really try to build a relationship with their students. Anyway, I got quite close to this professor, and he really wanted me to apply for an MBA at Wharton. I have no doubt that he would have written me a recommendation letter. But I didn't have the $100 000 for tuition at Wharton. Being from a middle class immigrant background in the EU with a sibling in college, I felt I couldn't ask my parents for help. And the eye-watering price tag just scared me. That was just the tuition, not including living expenses in the US. I know you Americans are used to those big numbers, but when my father went to grad school in the US he went to a state University and it was extremely cheap in those days (early 1980s).\\nAnyway, that's my story of why I didn't even bother to apply to one of the top business schools in the US even though I would have had the support of someone in the system.

He was given the name Godongwana at birth, but was banished from his clan for allegedly plotting to assassinate his aging father. He renamed himself Dingiswayo which is translated as \\"the exile\\", or \\"the wanderer\\", living as a fugitive.Dingiswayo travelled around the region and was taken in and protected by various Nguni tribes. This hospitality would later inspired his lifelong dream of uniting all the Nguni speaking peoples in a federation - each maintaining distinct customs and local power but paying central tribute to him and providing common defence. Dingiswayo lived amongst various groups as he had to continually flee to avoid those who were hunting him.He also had contact with the Portuguese. In the show he is presented as a modernizer, eagerly trading ivory and cattle for Portuguese goods. The show goes as far as to suggest he travelled to Delagoa Bay and served a local king as an adviser in strategizing how to play the Portuguese and Arabs against each other, although that might be just creative license.Dingiswayo eventually returned to his tribe after his father died, and challenged his brother for the throne. He returned on horseback and with political ideals of federation with a standing military rather than ad hoc warrior groups. He initiated the regimental system under which Shaka trained, modernising the military and making it more competent.He and Shaka disagreed in their world views. Shaka was eager to crush his opponents and engage in punitive total war. Dingiswayo was forgiving and diplomatic. He wanted to unite the tribes to stop their squabbling and provide for common defense under his rule. Shaka wanted to conquer and probably felt that unity comes through submission.Dingiswayo's acceptance of Shaka also hints at a forgiving and meritocratic spirit. Shaka and his mother were disgraced outcasts from their community, because Shaka was born out of wedlock. Dingiswayo took them in. When Shaka began to excel militarily, Dingiswayo praised him and gave him more power. The show depicts him doing this even at the expense of his son, who is imagined to have been jealous of Shaka. Eventually Dingiswayo gave Shaka a unit to support him in going back to Shaka's clan (amaZulu) to take over and become King. He wanted Shaka to become King as a member of a broader Nguni federation. Without Dingiswayo's mentorship and support, there would probably never have been a King Shaka.So Dingiswayo was cosmopolitan, open minded, federalist, diplomatic and love international trade. But he was also a serious military strategist and conqueror who modernised his army and projected force to stabilise his region. Basically a perfect fit for this sub, at least by the standards of his time and place.https://www.sahistory.org.za/people/chief-dingiswayo","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"And would killing them help anyone?","title":"Biden gives life in prison to 37 of 40 federal death row inmates so Trump can't have them executed"},{"text":"if i could commute that CEO's sentence to life in prison i'd do so in a heartbeat.\\nsimilarly, if either of these murderers were on the street killing people left and right and police/law would say ''nothing we can do, they're following the law'', i would definitely understand why someone would take matters in their own hands and take them off the streets in the only way possible.","title":"Biden gives life in prison to 37 of 40 federal death row inmates so Trump can't have them executed"},{"text":"Tax the rich, Joe.","title":"Biden Commutes 37 Death Sentences Ahead of Trumps Plan to Resume Federal Executions"},{"text":"Did you expect anything else?","title":"Biden pulled off a $370 billion miracle for the climate.

I understand your point, let me just clarify my point a bit further, too. For example, if someone says, \\"These scorch marks prove a dragon exists,\\" and the skeptic responds, \\"I dont think so; these scorch marks could be from a flamethrower,\\"So when this scenario happens, the first burden of proof is, of course, going to be on the guy claiming that the scorch marks was the dragon right? However, when the skeptic says, \\"No, I think these scorch marks could be from a flamethrower,\\" this is where we disagree. When I read this, I read this as a counter claim or, as you say, the alternate hypothesis. However, this alternate hypothesis still needs to be not disproved/disproved because it's the _second_ alternate hypothesis. Remember, the null hypothesis of the first claim of the dragon is \\"it's not a dragon.\\" When that null hypothesis is proven true, then you need another set of null and alternate hypotheses which is trying to prove a relationship via the flamethrower (is not a flamethrower/is a flame thrower). An alternate hypothesis semantically may mean an alternate explanation, but statistically, the Null and Alternate hypotheses are related only by negation, i.e., null means no relation. Alternate means some relation. Going back to the scorch marks, subconsciously, I think both of us can agree that it's just the most logical and cogent explanation. But imagine we were cave men who have not discovered fire. To offer another cause/relationship, you would need to get a new set of hypotheses and prove one true. Otherwise the skeptic in this case is saying, \\"nah, you are just wrong,\\" without engaging the evidence presented. They _could_ say that, but for their assertion or, more precisely, negation to have any merit and logic, they need to provide _something_.However, skeptics are not obligated to replace theistic claims with alternative explanations to reject them. The rejection of insufficient evidence doesnt necessitate counter-claimsit is simply a refusal to accept unsupported assertions.I wholeheartedly agree with this. But this scenario happens when someone says, \\"I believe there is a God because I know it.\\" Here, there is literally no evidence, so the burden of proof will not go to the person saying, \\"nah, I don't think so.\\" But if the person is saying \\"I believe there is a God, here is evidence X Y Z\\" then when the skeptic says \\"I don't think so,\\" there is atleast some burden on the skeptic to the degree that they must provide an explanation or reasoning that either says \\"evidence X Y Z is completely unrelated, or caused by another thing, etc.\\"Put more simply: The rejection of insufficient evidenceHas to first prove that the evidence IS insufficient and what WOULD count as sufficient evidence. Again, just like the flamethrower, we have underlying, subconscious assumptions because some facts are just so common. However, in a dialouge we have to disregard assumptions and look at everything from point 0.","title":"CMV: The Burden of Proof Does Not Fall Upon Atheists"},{"text":" Ok ill bite.

Have you honestly never been told examples of misandry in the Democratic party, and how sure are you you aren't doing the same behavior?Let's cover just three examples.1. There is no section to appeal to men on the Democratic website for a campaign level.2. The Democratic party has opposed shared custody bills on a state level numerous times3. The Violence Against Women Act for a federal level. (Both in name and structure. While the act was later amended to allow funding to male shelters, shelters which had already begun to be funded were grandfathered in, and the money was already allocated).These are, by far, not the only examples.

At that point, I would assert that I don't believe that misdeed is as significant as Trump's detractors are making it out to be.For me, though, the bigger reason I don't take these prosecutions seriously is that the proceedings all just happened to take place during 2024 election season, despite the supposed crimes having taken place at various times over the previous seven years. The Stormy Daniels checks from Trump to Michael Cohen were written in 2017 and were reported on in January 2018, but the indictment was not brought until March 2023, five years later, with the trial starting in April 2024, right at the beginning of campaign season.With the election interference prosecution, the events took place on January 6, 2021, but the indictment wasn't returned until August of 2023, two and a half years later.Regarding the classified documents, Trump's term ended January 2021, the raid took place August 8, 2022, and the indictment was returned June 2023, with the trial initially set to take place May 2024.Lastly, the Georgia election interference indictment was returned in August 2023, almost three years after the 2020 election.

With liberals it more about creating the space in which a group of people's identity can thrive (big tent party). The key difference being that conservatives would absolutely restrict individual identity given the opportunity. I think that the constraint though is a defining characteristic of any identity. Meaning by that constraint people can better relate to that and bring meaning from it. I think when it comes to culture it seems like at least with Trump it's very hierarchical and whatever he says goes. That strong delineation of one idea or another is important because whatever the idea is it will be loud ... albeit often stupid ideas. He also plays into the primal part of our nature which is tribal warfare. Having an enemy, villainizing, and ruthlessly attacking is paramount to progress because it's a way of filtering those that adhere to the culture and those that don't. We need someone that can do something of the same.","title":"The Economy Has Been Great Under Biden.

I read the text of the IRA when it came out and was dismayed to find that it was indeed almost all tax refunds and partial loans that required enormous investments from private interests. That means only large corporations could even apply for the money but meanwhile there were many strings attached meaning that much of the funding just sat there because nobody who had the tens of millions of dollars to invest was willing to take the chance even with the loan guarantees because it was never free money. To get that money you had to put up your own cash, that's what is known as \\"matching funds\\" and it means very few interest can even begin to consider applying and those that have such cash are not inclined to invest in renewable energy because it's quite likely they have investments in incumbent industries already. But the Democrats insisted on just repeating over and over that this was the greatest climate bill in history and imagined that by repeating this mantra over and over it would eventually stick. Now that Biden's inner circle has realized he's too far gone to continue and the second term has been wasted  handing it back to Trump those funds are never going to get spent. Meanwhile, oil and gas interests were being funded by that exact same spending bill that was sold as \\"climate legislation\\" leading to record oil production in the US. Now ask yourself: who had the money to get those matching funds? Maybe the oil and gas companies were the intended recipients all along, right? This is what I mean by \\"baking in\\" the results. This is an abject failure of centrist Democratic political games. The medium is the message in other words. A document does not exist in isolation, its persuasiveness includes the premises of the media that is used to present it. This document, the IRA, was presented as if it would cause a rennaissance of US solar but clearly the committee that drafted it, including Biden and Manchin, were well aware that by making the funds contingent upon matching commitments from investors with millions to play with that they were loading the dice. Are we really supposed to be so naive that we would accept this was a coincidence or that they were unaware of where the money is? How can supposedly serious media outlets to be taken as responsible purveyors of the truth when they are engaged in such deception as trying to sell this as sincere?   It's good news for China, that's for sure. They've been made to look like the good guys and the US looks like a declining empire. The Biden Administration was a tragic failure from all sides. When he was running in 2020, he was sold to us  as \\"The New Bernie\\" and we were assured that he was the one who was going to push forward the agenda we hoped we would have gotten from Sanders in 2016 but here we are. . . it's Christmas 2024.

This includes selling off a percentage of shares in the case of a family business or land if the family has been farming for generations. Plenty of farmers are land rich and cash poor. Much the same for quite a few businesses. The business may have land and equipment and materials... also insurance, payroll, money owed and money owed to them, materials that need to be reordered... the owner may have almost everything sunk into the business and be drawing only a small amount out as 'salary' to pay their mortgage and grocery bills, etc. \\nIf there is a downturn, they may not take out anything or may even lose money for a time. A high percentage of  new businesses actually lose money for the first year or more. ...Yet if they die, their family may pay taxes on a million dollars worth of stuff which has value,  but is not money in the bank.\\nSomeone with cash can make an offer. X$ for 10 acres, or a % of your father's company.

The democratic leadership want young progressive people to vote for \\"do nothing\\" democrats. So they're going to run Harris again with the same messaging as last time. Except this time when they ask her what she'd do different from Biden, she'll have a sound bite prepared.\\n  \\nDemocrat and Republican leadership want the same thing: to retain power and continue to line their pockets from donations and lobbyists. The republicans accomplish this by appealing to racists, low-informationals, xenophobes, religious nutjobs, and the 1%. The democrats accomplish this by making everyone else think that the democrats are actually a progressive party willing to make progressive change that benefits people who value education and equality.  \\n  \\nThe democrats might win next election depending on how bad trump rat-fucks the country. If the democrats win, it will be based on 'leopards at my face' backlash against trump, president musk, and the Dipshit Circus (bannon, johnson, MTG, etc). it all depends on how many white christian women die while having miscarriages, and how many of the rednecks' own lgbtq children are lynched by their hate-filled maga nut cousins. Trump is already pissing off Canada, and wants storm the Panama canal, so even before he takes office, it's looking quite promising that he will piss off most of the 1st world countries and cause financial devastation and market uncertainty.\\n  \\nIf democrats win back with the 2028 election it will take 4 years to basically get things back to where they are now (if that can be done). At the end of which the republicans will start yammering about how much the democrats \\"spent\\" to do it and how little was accomplished (mostly due to republicans obstructionism). Add in a supposed rogue migrant caravan of brown rapists heading toward the border, and an anecdotal gender-fluid teen pissing in the \\"wrong\\" bathroom, and the conservative rubes will buy the messaging hook line and sinker. They'll march with pitchforks demanding that Obamacare be abolished (but keep the Affordable Care Act). The progressive voters will see Harris or whatever flaccid limp impotent democrat has been 'authorized' to run, and feel, once again, they've been let down. People under 30 will sit out the election out of disgust. The cycle will repeat. \\n  \\nOr.... McTurtleface will spend his remaining cpu cycles (between freeze ups) unsuccessfully trying to reign in the beast he nurtured. After 4 more years of climate catastrophe, dwindling resources, economic upheaval, inflation, bird flu, category 6 storms, animal extinctions, Earth will have moved beyond the point of no return.

Trump will be ready to shitcan the constitution completely, and take over permanently until dementia finally wins its long battle, and DeSantis takes up the reigns having finished turning Florida into a fact-free, science-free, education-free, reality-free christofascist utopia.  \\n  \\nBusiness as usual.","title":"Liberal leaders say they have a plan for a new, more effective anti-Trump resistance in 2025"},{"text":"I dunno, you'd think those red states in the south would put two and two together, who they've voted for and how they're doing now, but it ain't gonna happen.As long as republicans have their propaganda arm running full steam, more Americans are gonna take the lazy route and just believe them, rather than use critical thinking to find who's actually to blame (even though it's glaringly obvious).","title":"Jeffries: There will be 'no Democrats available' to save Mike Johnson's speakership"},{"text":"I left the Seattle area for Texas 4 years ago.

The marriages are equal to Gods here. That shouldve been pretty clear and my analogy is applicable to the discussion. Youre honestly just pulling this stuff out of your ass as your position doesnt really have any logical basis and youre moreso going nuh uh rather than demonstrating how my statements are wrong. By necessity if a claim is true that means every contradictory claim is false. A claim and its contradiction cannot both be true. God cannot both exist and not exist for example. Either God exists or doesnt. Similarly if Christianity is true then every religion that contradicts Christianity must be false. There cant be multiple truths that claim to be the only truth. That just makes no sense. Also the Christian God is described as one that cannot lie. If the Christian God exists then it is impossible for there to be other Gods and the Christian God just decided to lie about it because a lying God is not the Christian God. And nobody is saying to arbitrarily believe in a God without evidence, at least Im certainly not, so your last few sentences are just irrelevant here. In Christianity for example it is said that the faith is dependent on Jesus resurrecting. The religion doesnt teach yo just trust bro it is relying on a falsifiable claim (Jesus died and reassured). The idea of faith is more in line with confidence than it is blindly believing something is true based on vibes.","title":"CMV: The Burden of Proof Does Not Fall Upon Atheists"},{"text":"Historically, voters got information filtered to them through elite sources that knew what they were talking about.

A big one that's remained under the radar that'll plausibly ride on the heels of the various civil, suffrage, and property rights will be be the ramifications of past dealings with the indigenous populations within the US.The more of us that can be independent and/or financially secure rhe better, but lobbying directly through the US federal or state governments isn't the only option for significant political and cultural changes. The United States of America is not legally the only nation within its borders and what can't be disputed militarily is equally legally indefensible.","title":"Now that they can't use the votes anymore, the Biden administration has canceled their plan for mass student loan forgiveness"},{"text":"To be fair, American democracy kinda works because it's so hard to get elected.

Assuming the Christian god is real, it doesn't rule out the possibility that, for example, their god may have lied about the other gods because he wants to have the monopoly on followers. It is on you to provide evidence that all other gods aren't real and that yours is somehow special.

The thing everybody needs to really be watching out for is whether or not he manages to successfully flood media with propaganda so no one can ever hear an opposing thought, and worse, builds ways to make voting incredibly difficult for anybody that might oppose him, so he and whoever he hand picks can be in power forever. I've said it already that these countries that he's going to throw tariffs at can always sit back and wait 4 years for a new president who likely will take all that down, and let the American public suffer for it while they blame Trump.

In the past, they were allowed to hit children, but we obviously know now that other punishments are far better.As a teacher, I can also tell you that the children that are the hardest for others to control are the ones most strongly controlled by fear of their parents.

They are the biggest liars and decivers. They recognize that the West accepts and tolerates others, and uses democratic laws, they use this to their advantage. By remaining patient, maintaining strong religious and cultural values, and promoting high birth rates, they aim to outnumber the native population. Meanwhile, they pressure Western societies to become more secular, less religious, and more compliant with their demands (Just look how much money a year the arab leagues donate to western universities to promote and push certain beliefs) Over time, as their numbers grow, they will pass laws to oppress, tax, and control non-Muslims, pushing for conversions and eroding the freedoms the West cherishes. This scenario warns of the importance of standing firm against efforts to undermine Western values and ensuring that tolerance does not become a pathway to destruction.

They misunderstand how burden of proof works *and* the claims of atheists and theists.Burden of proof is generally a concept used by people to avoid the responsibility of having to justify their claims because they don't understand what burden of proof actually means.The burden of proof lies in whoever is making the claim. If you make a truth claim, you have the burden to provide evidence for that claim. That's it. Nothing more. The whole \\"proving a negative\\" is fucking nonsense that people fall back on to avoid responsibility for justifying their positions, which I'll get into.This brings us to Atheism. The constant argument is \\"atheists aren't making any claim at all - they're simply denying the claims of theists\\" - which is literally just not true at all. And even if it was true, that doesn't magically make what they're saying not a claim.If I say \\"The sky is blue\\" and you say \\"The sky is not blue\\", you can say one is a negation of the other all you want, but the fact is those are two claims being made. As a matter of fact, they're both negations of each other, logically speaking. So to say only one of them is a claim is to either deny their logical negation or deny that *either* are claims, which is obviously not true based on what we know a \\"claim\\" is.The issue with Atheism is the assertion that it is *only* a denial of the truth claims of a theist. If an atheist says \\"There is no God\\" and a theist says there is, that's a negation of the other but both are claims and both require burden of proof.If an atheist says \\"You lack sufficient evidence to prove your claim that God exists\\" to a theist, that is *still* a claim about what evidence is sufficient and the burden of proof is *still* on the Atheist to prove that the evidence is insufficient.And beyond that, I have never heard any atheist make any other claim that doesn't boil down to either \\"God doesn't exist\\" or \\"Theists do not provide sufficient evidence that God exists\\". Everything else just inevitably leads to those fundamental claims - which require burden of proof like any other claim in existence.So the entire idea that burden of proof is uniquely a theist's problem is just something people get wrong *constantly* and isn't true at all.","title":"CMV: The Burden of Proof Does Not Fall Upon Atheists"},{"text":"Turns out stranger things references are hardcore drugs now.

Of course Christians dont have concrete evidence of Gods existence, and the idea of needing to present proof flies in the face of faith. The entire idea of religion or spirituality is that it is belief in something bigger than you without hard proof. Thats why its called faith. It cant be looked at as a logical debate. People cant prove karma exists either, but they can choose to believe in it. And people who believe in it find evidence everywhere, confirmation bias. I say that as a Christian, but its the same thing for those who dont believe - theyll always find evidence to support their own belief system.?And this is why I think atheists shouldnt try to prove to Christians that theyre wrong, and Christians shouldnt try to prove to atheists that theyre wrong. Its about your belief system, and thats incredibly, incredibly personal. Spirituality or religion are how a lot of people make sense of the world, and its always been that way. If that doesnt jive with your worldview, thats totally okay, but seeking proof in the clinical, logical way that you are looking for it is not what religion is about, really. If I could prove it, that wouldnt be faith.?I think the more critical question is *why* I believe in something that I cant prove with hard evidence. If you want to have open, deep theological conversations with people, then that should be the question asked, rather than it always circling back to the idea that someone needs to prove the unprovable - that it does or does not exist. Nobody knows, and how superior do you have to be on either side to think that your opinion must be the correct one about this unknowable topic??","title":"CMV: The Burden of Proof Does Not Fall Upon Atheists"},{"text":"i don't know, someone who had a stroke and went from publicly claiming to be a progressive all the way to frequently defending trump, along with a general contrarian personality.... there's no reason to make fun of them, but that's a not a person i would want to have any authority or responsibility. strokes can change a persons entire personality and can change their cognitive abilities. and as different as he is from 3-4 years ago before the stroke its fair for voters to change their opinions of him.","title":"Democratic Sen.
