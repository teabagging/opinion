You won't be able to take care of your kids, you won't be able to rest, you won't be able to do housework or anything else that needs doing. You will need the rest of the month off just to recover - but you won't get it.

He implemented a bunch last time - among the biggest tax increases in US history. He may be under a lot of pressure to raise taxes to fund the inevitable tax-cuts-for-billionaires, and to pay for his \\"efficiency savings\\" from cutting departments.But even if the risk of them is low, the cost to the public of them has already been high (companies reducing investment in preparation for higher costs).

That I am convinced, was a much more run-of-the-mill kind of attempt, spurred by financial incentive and ideological fervor coming together in an unstable individual.But the first attempt was not that. It was much more carefully, yet hastily, orchestrated and only a fraction of an inch from being successful. A pretty clear case of security-stripping.There were apparently some indications via findings at the scene and his house that he was a possible recruit and asset for one of the Feds' entrapment operations involving making bombs.The assassin was being tapped, but not as a shooter, because of his aforementioned limitations.This is why it is belived to be a hasty attempt thrown together at a late hour, after the major attempts to use lawfare to neutralize Trumplestiltskin failed and after his winning of the primary. The final security-stripping occured the night before and morning of the event, based on the supposed need to cover a sudden and seemingly arbitrary trip to the state by Jill Biden.Those in power who chose to do this needed a *disposable* asset to do it though. If it even *looked* too professional, it would *definitely* start a civil war, rather than there being the mere possibility of it after Trumplestiltskin's death, which they were already clearly prepared to manage via the media, judging by how they reacted in lockstep, complete with an apparent directive to ignore and minimize it (just like you're doing) while they whistled past the graveyard and hoped no one would notice all the fuckery they'd had to engage in, just to make sure it could even happen.The second attempt as I said, was likely a fluke for two reasons: the first being that not just the public, but members of the opposing faction of the aristocracy were now looking directly at the SS and elsewhere, digging to find out who might have orchestrated the attempt and on high alert to even more bullshit.The other was the fact the near miss demonstrated that he would have become a martyr if killed and no one would ever believe it wasn't the government.Which meant that it would be the government the people came for. Not their cats-paws and proxies. Them.And the people would not bother trying to differentiate to see who should be spared, so it wouldn't even matter which faction had done it.So both 'sides' of the uniparty shut it all down, with any discussion of it kept to a minimum and as I said, full of minimizations and scolding about people believing in conspiracy theories.But hey, it's not like the only difference these days between a conspiracy theory and accepted fact is about six months to a year, right?","title":"Donald Trump gets unexpected praise from Bernie Sanders: \\"Good idea\\""},{"text":"\\"Liberals always support fascists\\"","title":"Donald Trump Gets Unexpected Praise from Bernie Sanders: 'Good Idea'"},{"text":"r/somethingiswrong2024","title":"Trump isnt hiding plan to use military to quash protests and deport immigrants"},{"text":"You'd be better served investigating the answers yourself.

And is among other things very strongly nativist and xenophobic - albeit not strictly speaking racist and LGB bigoted across the board.At the same time Trump is, rhetorically, definitely a bit of a moderate compared to where the GOP (and GOP base) was at with McCain + Romney.In practice this is a different matter entirely, but Trumps *rhetoric* very much includes moderate stances on abortion, a total normalization (so far at least) of LGB rights, marijuana legalization, and most strikingly a total 180 on core neocon policies incl military interventionism and free trade.Trumps opposition to the latter two things is, basically, why he has the working class (and union member) vote. Despite ofc embracing anti-union and anti-worker policies.Incidentally those both are, to an extent, traditional positions of the US white (and white minority) working class left. and Trump *has* captured those demographics / the grandkids + great grandkids thereof in near totality in former US left wing bastions of the country as such.TLDR; the US working class of the rust belt *hates* free trade / NAFTA.

So one question to ask when assessing the value of crypto is: Going forward, globally will there be more growth in the mainstream legal markets, or in grey markets; where will the job growth be, where will consumers be, where will the products be sold? It's a measure of the grey markets in a similar way that fiat is a measure of the mainstream marketsFiat has inflation baked in; it's a requirement.

But hey, you want to go into it at length? Sure. Let's do that.Yes. I am a leftist, most interested in improving the material conditions of workers lives. Problem for you lot is, then that brings us directly to my class. Because they are inseparable. Inextricably bound, no matter how much bourgeois PMC scolds like to try and tell us they are separate. They are not.So let me offer you a different perspective, shall I? Perhaps you have been fortunate enough to not have their presence used as both implicit and explicit threat for your entire working life in order to drive down wages, benefits (fuck, who am I kidding? What benefits after decades of this shit? Most jobs offer no such thing.) while whipping practically everyone you've ever known into higher and higher productivity (shit-tons more work/hours) by using the threat of being replaced by these yet more unfortunate people at the drop of a hat, but you need to understand that at this point, you are in the minority in that experience.Something needs to be done and the whining PMC who in reality tend to benefit the most from the opportunities presented them by illegal immigration, when they are asked for effective, rapid solutions to the problem and/or implementation, come back with this fuckery. Every time.Just another list of reasons why we just can't do anything about it.So if anything, what the election should be telling you is this: The people are done waiting. The people are no longer fucking around. Is. That. Clear?You had your cosmos-be-damned chances to do this the hard, but proper way, so now the people demand that it be done the really hard way. If you lot don't like it, then you should have fucking thought of that before you decided to use it in your class war against us. This is the reality your kind have created.So you can fucking whine about 'puritanical this' and 'ideology' that, but this is about real misery inflicted and ignored for far, far too long, on real people. Not just on them, but us too. Not that you appear to collectively give a shit.Moreover, from the perspective of a native descendant like me, you're almost all immigrants, so I think I'm actually being quite fucking reasonable in being ok with people who have crossed the border illegally and taken up residence/work unvetted, being sent back until or unless they can make legal entry. And no, I don't give a fuck if they're from Canada, Ireland, Spain, whatever, or what color their skin is. Out with them.I'm also fine with immigration being made much easier and more permissive, because the bar for entry by that route has always been to high.What I am not ok with, is the situation as it stands, or listening to any more sniveling excuses as to why we should do nothing about it. It has been used against us for far too long.You don't have to like it any more than I do. But as I said, this is the reality your kind have created for us to deal with. No more emotional blackmail. No more threats about how the entire economy will collapse without them so you can keep using it as a wedge issue, toying with all our lives for the benefit of only a few.All that tells us is that the system which keeps you nice and comfortable, only exists and is propped up by taking advantage of indentured servitude and slavery. By using our compassion against us.Does that sound like something people in my class would be remotely interested in keeping around? Because let me assure you, it is fucking not.There.

Trump has already made multiple threats against the media, journalists, the \\"fake news\\" networks, and any individual or organization in particular that has hurt his precious feelings.I'll highlight the parts pertaining to this particular subject, but also try and see for yourself just how many parallels you can draw between Trumpism and fascism:Let's start with Laurence W. Britt, who published *\\"Fascism Anyone?\\"*, which included a list of 14 defining characteristics of fascism. This list has become widely shared and circulated:- \\"Powerful and continuing expressions of nationalism\\"\\n- \\"Disdain for the importance of human rights\\"\\n- \\"Identification of enemies/scapegoats as a unifying cause\\"\\n- \\"The supremacy of the military/avid militarism\\"\\n- \\"Rampant sexism\\"\\n- \\"A controlled mass media\\"\\n- \\"Obsession with national security\\"\\n- \\"Religion and ruling elite tied together\\"\\n- \\"Power of corporations protected\\"\\n- \\"Power of labor suppressed or eliminated\\"\\n- \\"Disdain and suppression of intellectuals and the arts\\"\\n- \\"Obsession with crime and punishment\\"\\n- \\"Rampant cronyism and corruption\\"\\n- \\"Fraudulent elections\\"Robert Paxton, author of *Anatomy of Fascism*, which is one of the better books on the subject, describes fascism as having foundations that lie in a set of \\"mobilizing passions.\\" He argues these passions can explain much of the behaviour of fascists:- a sense of overwhelming crisis beyond the reach of any traditional solutions;\\n- the primacy of the group, toward which one has duties superior to every right, whether individual or universal, and the subordination of the individual to it;\\n- the belief that ones group is a victim, a sentiment that justifies any action, without legal or moral limits, against its enemies, both internal and external;\\n- dread of the groups decline under the corrosive effects of individualistic liberalism, class conflict, and alien influences;\\n- the need for closer integration of a purer community, by consent if possible, or by exclusionary violence if necessary;\\n- the need for authority by natural chiefs (always male), culminating in a national chieftain who alone is capable of incarnating the groups historical destiny;\\n- the superiority of the leaders instincts over abstract and universal reason;\\n- the beauty of violence and the efficacy of will, when they are devoted to the groups success;\\n- the right of the chosen people to dominate others without restraint from any kind of human or divine law, right being decided by the sole criterion of the groups prowess within a Darwinian struggle.Jason Stanley, author of *How Fascism Works,* provides examples of how fascist tactics are implemented:- The mythical pastused to invoke a nostalgia for a fictional time when the nation was great as it was not yet sullied by the Other.\\n- Propagandato attack enemies, to justify violence, to justify laws against Them and to support the authoritarian leader.\\n- Anti-intellectualismto attack the media, universities, and scientists when they contradict the strong mans authority.\\n- Unrealitysupporting conspiracy theories that tarnish the Other along with an outright denial of facts when convenient.\\n- Hierarchyespousing a natural order where the Us are hardworking, moral, law-abiding and productive members of society, while the Other is not.\\n- Victimhoodcasting Us as victims of Them, who are taking resources from Us and demanding special rights.\\n- Law and orderusing laws to justify violence, oppression, and expulsion of the Other.\\n- Sexual anxietyas the Other embraces non-traditional approaches to sexuality,\\n- Appeals to the heartlandas rural communities are often more homogeneous and conservative (more Us) while urban cities are often more diverse, cosmopolitan (more Them).\\n- Dismantling of public welfare and unityby casting aside safety net programs as unfair giveaways to Them, who are not working, as opposed to Us, who are.I dunno about you, but I found that Trumpism covers almost all the bases here.Yes, the term \\"fascism\\" has kind of lost some of its meaning recently, and as a result, Trump supporters will simply roll their eyes whenever they hear the accusation, while simultaneously being on board with many of the... pre requisites mentioned in this post.One thing they'll argue is, \\"how come Trump wasn't a fascist during his first term huh!? Checkmate libs!\\"But he tried, and your memory-holing of his presidency, of his efforts to overturn the election, his promotion of election denying misinformation, of his incendiary and xenophobic rhetoric, of his autocratic whims, his many attempts to obstruct justice, his unconstitutional threats, his appeal to white supremacist groups, his incitement of violence against marginalized people, and his overtly bigoted, ultra nationalistic, nativist, highly divisive, insular and intolerant fascist language doesn't change that.Not only that, but during Trump's last presidency, he had people around him, people who acted as guardrails against his worst impulses and instincts, and this time around, Trump has and will surround himself with loyalists who won't act as checks against his authoritarian and fascist whims, instead, they'll be there to enable him, embolden him, use him.While at the same time, according to Trump's sycophants, we are not supposed to take this stuff seriously, Trump just \\"exaggerates\\" sometimes, admitting of course, that Donald Trump isn't a serious candidate.Trump's absurdity magically renders him benign? Is that what you're saying? We're just supposed to look the other way, and not take him at his word? All his recent threats and his dangerous, anti-democratic rhetoric are just jokes?His followers will literally tell us that he doesn't actually mean what he says... That we shouldn't listen to the things he's saying, or he's really just saying something else entirely, which is a load of horse shit.These people will continue to rationalize and defend him to no end. Minimizing and downplaying his threats and rhetoric, but when he becomes president, these same people will show us that they were behind his authoritarian and fascist instincts all along.","title":"'Potentially Ominous Trend' for Press Freedom as Trump Wages Legal War on News Outlets | \\n\\"Governments and powerful figures threatening journalists and media outlets with costly legal battles and bankruptcy is a common tactic against press freedom in repressive countries,\\" said one journalist."},{"text":"Which ones?

Walmart &amp; Target are really pushing this inflation narrative.There's no way that swipe fees materially increase costs to retailers.  Know how to prove it?  Go into your local retailer and pay cash.  If they don't give you a cash discount, then swipe fees didn't increase the costs to consumers - at least not as materially as they want you to believe.  If it were *truly* material, why not give a cash discount  Try it with buying a car instead... negotiate a \\"finance\\" versus \\"cash offer\\" and you'll get very different sales prices - because the dealers get significant kick-back from financing offers.  For them, the method of payment matters a lot to their bottom line... but for big box retailers?  No way... it's lobbyists pandering to \\"American consumers\\" to increase profits.Here's an example to illustrate.  I'm using Giant Eagle as a reference since they're cited in your blog post.|Item|Before|After|% Increase|$ Increase|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|COGS|$50|$55|10%|$5|\\n|Sales Price|$52.50|$57.76|10.02%|$5.26|\\n|Service Fee|$1.3125 (2.5%)|$1.4534 (2.51625%\\\\~)|11% (0.65%)|$0.14|\\n|Margin |$1.1875 (2.26%)|$1.3065 (2.26%)|0|$0.12|*\\\\~Where am I getting this number?  Your blog post from 2022 cites that Giant Eagle is quoting a $1.3M cost as a result of the MSF increase.  Their 2021 annual revenue was about $10Bn.  If we assume that 80% of transactions are credit cards, then that $1.3M cost has to be absorbed by $8Bn of Revenue, implying an increase in the MSF of .65%.  In other words, 2.5% paid on 8Bn of Rev = 200M; 2.51625% paid on 8Bn of Rev = 201.3M, which is the increase of 1.3M in cost.*What this example shows is that, in order to hold Giant Eagle's Margin stable at 2.26% (*sidenote: their net is probably around 2 or 3 %... I'm just going to assume constant labor, etc. here to demo the impact of merchant fees vs generic COGS*), then consumers have to pay **$5.26** more for this good.  Those dollars are allocated primarily to the COGS (suppliers) as **$5**, and then roughly equally between Giant Eagle's profit margin and the MSF.  In reality though, we also probably see things like **labor increases** and other GOE increases (like advertising, insurance premiums, etc.) that create even more pressure on the bottom line... so Giant Eagle has to increase the sales price well above simply the COGS increases.  But the important thing is that even though the service fee increased by a large *percentage* (11%), the actual impact to the consumer is quite muted (0.14 / 5.26 = 2.6%).  All of the other inflationary pressures (in this example, COGS) are having an outsized impact relative to the MSF increase they're citing.In addition to this bullshit narrative, the reality is that handling cash is [expensive](https://www.plainscapital.com/blog/the-cost-of-accepting-cash/).  Pennies are more expensive to produce than their value.  Cash has to be continuously pulled out of circulation, destroyed, re-printed and minted, and shipped all over.  Cash can be easily stolen / pilfered, and the US taxes are likely under-reported (thus Fed missing out on money) due to cash transactions.  By pretty much any measure, electronic forms of payment are faster, easier to trace / track / reconcile, more reliable, and safer.  And over the past several decades, we've had even more companies enter the space; from Apple and Google Pay, to proprietary apps like Starbucks, and P2P solutions like Venmo / Zelle.  If anything, the issue with electronic payments should be that they make spending money *too easy*... but retailers aren't putting up any stink about that!I'm certainly not saying we should ban cash entirely... but the false narrative that credit cards are contributing to inflation via merchant service fees should absolutely be challenged.","title":"Bernie Sanders tentatively pledges to support cap on credit card interest rates proposed by Trump."},{"text":"r/ibew","title":"Trump Judge Blocks Overtime Pay For 4 Million Workers"},{"text":"Education is a state's responsibility.

Is that you Kyle? Peer-reviewed research shows that conservatives are generally cowards. This threat-bias can distort reality, fuel irrational fears, and make one more vulnerable to fear-mongering politicians.liberals own more books and travel-related items, conservatives have more things that kept order in their lives, like calendars and cleaning supplies. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-in-the-machine/201612/fear-and-anxiety-drive-conservatives-political-attitudes\\"the right-wing response to the pandemic is part of a larger political practice: Victimized Bully Syndrome.Some of you will be familiar with DARVO, an acronym for deny, attack and reverse victim and offender. DARVO describes the behavior of psychological abusers when they are being held accountable for their behavior. Donald Trump and his supporters clearly exhibit DARVO habits. Rather than accept blame for anything they do, they turn around and accuse those blaming them of creating the problem. Victimized Bully Syndrome (VBS), as I'm describing it, though, is slightly different from DARVO. With DARVO the abusive behavior comes first and DARVO only emerges if the attacker is asked to take responsibility. But with VBS the cries of being victims come first and are used to justify the underlying bullying behaviors. The bully under VBS is always already acting in self-defense.Take this example: In a recent interview with Fox News, Dr. Mehmet Oz, candidate for Senate in Pennsylvania suggested that Americans had been victimized by President Biden's \\"one-size-fits-all\\" COVID-19 \\"rules that limit our freedom.\\" According to Oz, U.S. citizens \\"want government to get out of their way to stop scaring them into submission.\\"If we set aside the sheer stupidity of a doctor suggesting that we need \\"as many different approaches as possible\\" to the pandemic, the critical takeaway is Oz's claim that Biden's policy is designed to victimize the public by scaring them, taking away their freedoms, and destroying their dignity. According to this logic, refusing to wear a mask, get vaccinated, or support public health policy is a valid defense, rather than bullying behavior that puts everyone in peril.And lest there be any doubt, the right isn't just refusing to be vaccinated and to follow public health guidelines; in the face of the pandemic they have chosen to respond with aggressive bullying: engaging in violent confrontations over masking policies, attacking teachers, threatening school board members, violently trolling scientists who speak to the media about COVID, and more. In fact, the violent far-right has exploded in the United States along with COVID-19.Similar to the \\"sore winner syndrome\\" we saw emerge in the wake of former President Trump's election, VBS posits that those on the right are all the time being victimized by their government and that it makes perfect sense to respond aggressively.It is this exact same logic that was the backdrop to the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol and we can see the same logic in play in right-wing responses to the House investigation into the attack. Trump spokesperson Taylor Budowich claimed, \\"Democracy is under attack. However, not by the people who illegally entered the Capitol on January 6th, 2021, but instead by a committee whose members walk freely in its halls every day.\\" That's right, according to Budowich the real threat to our democracy are those elected officials investigating what happened on January 6, not the actual people who attacked the Capitol. Those people were, according to this twisted logic, simply victims of election fraud.It gets worse.The victim card was at the heart of the Kyle Rittenhouse case as well. Rittenhouse claimed he shot three men, two fatally, with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle in self-defense. In his testimony, Rittenhouse stated the only reason he even went to Kenosha, Wisconsin on the night of the shootings was to provide first aid to people in need. Rittenhouse, then, was no average vigilante. Instead, he was an already victimized one, prepared to claim self-defense if he attacked anyone. In a post-verdict statement issued by the victims' parents, they nail the dangers of Rittenhouse's VBS. The verdict, according to them, \\"sends the unacceptable message that armed civilians can show up in any town, incite violence, and then use the danger they have created to justify shooting people in the street.VBS, then, isn't only being used by the right to foster a public health catastrophe, it is literally being used to justify armed murder and armed insurrection. As long as we allow the right to continue to describe themselves as victims who have been harmed, injured, threatened and therefore need to act aggressively in self-defense, the closer we get to civil war. In fact, a recent Public Religion Research Institute poll showed that 30 percent of Republicans believe that \\"true American patriots\\" might need to resort to violence in order to save the country. Nearly 40% still think the election was stolen.So as long as the victimized bully syndrome pandemic is transmitted across the right-wing community, it will continue to surpass any threats to our nation from any new variants to the COVID-19 pandemic. Until we address the real threats to our nation, we not only won't stop COVID-19; we will allow the true risks to our health and the health of our democracy to continue to spread.\\"https://www.salon.com/2021/12/27/the-conservative-urge-to-be-a-victim-why-right-wing-victimhood-is-spreading-so-fast/?origin=serp_auto","title":"With Trump's return, are Jan 6 Capitol rioters off the hook?"},{"text":"Hear me out: if we snap California off at the San Andreas, we *might* be able to pull the Columbia off the coast and send it south from Portland... buy it's really got to snap in just the right way to crack Oregon.","title":"Canada working with Biden team to finalize B.C. river treaty before Trump takes office"},{"text":"We should think I'm a broader scope.

It's not like a merger is going to diversify what's being offered, they both offer the same thing now, a place for right wing clickbait trolls, fanatics, political agitators, bots, foreign provocateurs, propagandists and disinformation peddlers to congregate and validate each other's grievances, conspiracy theories, hatred, phobias and victimhood. Hell, it's likely that such a move will drive even more users away from the platform. It's the opposite of increasing market share. Additionally, both platforms are hemorrhaging money or plummeting in value, so this won't help improve their financial strength, and it's not like one platform's losses are going to offset the other's profits.So there's no room for growth.The only advantage might be tax benefits of some kind, but Im not an expert there.Throughout Trump's career, he's bankrupted or financially  drained dozens of businesses he's tried to slap his name on. As time has gone on, fewer and fewer people have been willing to work with Trump. He's fucked over many small businesses, contractors, employees and colleagues. Over the years, Trump and his businesses have been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of them involving financial crimes, tax and state law violations, fraud allegations, real estate disputes, employment and labor disputes, disputes with patrons, business tax disputes, all the fucking disputes, and of course defamation and personal lawsuits.Getting involved with Trump financially is basically a bad business decision. This is while Twitter has nose-dived in value ever since Musk's takeover. And it's estimated to get worse. In other words, it's a recipe for disaster. Keep in mind that some of Musk's companies are heavily subsidized, receiving billions in federal funding and taking advantage of pre existing government technology. All while he whines incessantly everyday on Twitter about government waste.It says a lot about our economic system and culture because both of these \\"financial geniuses\\" have benefitted from using their wealth, power and privilege throughout their lives, to fail over and over and over again until something works. But us poor fucking schmos don't, and never will have this privilege. Populism my ass...Donald Trump's greatest financial achievement was inheriting Daddy's empire. And over a period of time in the '80s and '90s, tax information shows that Donald Trump had lost more money than any living American. Despite all his claims about \\"winning,\\" he was literally the biggest loser.Trump had squandered his riches, and If it wasn't for The Apprentice, an opportunity that was dropped in his lap at just the right time, he would have lived up to being the failure he was always meant to be, and he probably would have never come down those escalators on that fateful day.Donald Trump is not the financial guru his supporters make him out to be, in fact, his economic and foreign policy was disastrous, something that has escaped most Americans. Just like what happened after he inherited his father's real estate empire, Trump inherited a growing economy in 2017, and he left office in 2020 with the economy in tatters.But, as we've learned, most Americans have short-term memories, are low propensity voters, and care more about their immediate circumstances than they do any context or facts of the matter.And now it's estimated that Trump's economic proposals for his next presidency will be potentially far more damage for our economy.What they really have to worry about with a merger like this, is how to deal with two mentally unstable narcissists sharing ownership of a platform. Both Musk and Trump have been called incredibly difficult people to work with by former colleagues and staff. Witnessing the fallout alone might just be worth the fact that these two manchildren are going to end up turning Twitter into an even worse version of itself... Unfortunately, this will be bad for everyone.","title":"Will Donald Trump's Truth Social merge with Elon Musk's X?

China ain't going to invade Tawain.  China, unlike, well us, gave up ambitions of military conquest back in the seventies when they fought Vietnam.  China wants to become the economic hegemony in Asia... not the military hegemony.  China will absolutely try to impose economic hardships on Taiwan... but its not going to attempt a D-Day landing anytime soon.\\n2. Russia invading Belarus matters to me about as much as Iran invading Iraq.  Not our problem... and before it comes up, were Russia to invade a NATO nation, that would be our problem.  But that is even more unlikely... Putin wants power, and he knows if he invades a NATO nation defended by American nuclear weapons all he will end up with is a glass parking lot to rule over.\\n3. Venezuela invading a neighbor matters to me as much as Iran invading Iraq.  Hell, it matters even less to me than Russia invading Belarus because Venezuela is even less of a threat to us than Russia is.\\n4. Yes actually, 1930's populist isolation doesn't sound that bad.  Twenty years ago when I was full of piss and vinegar and had no real concept of a life well spent I had a different opinion.  But now, after we've literally spent the past twenty years actively engaged in a war and are now engaged in a proxy war...  Yeah... I'd rather my children not have to endure the hardships my generation has had to endure because some fossils from the Reagan-era are disappointed that they never got their Dr. Strangelove showdown with the USSR.The only people, on the right at least, pushing us towards war right now are the Reaganites who were too young to go to Vietnam, but too old to go to Afghanistan and don't know what war really is... none of you can be trusted to make wise decisions on any subject that may result in any of our children dying on foreign soil.Now for the part you probably won't appreciate... you presumed that Ukraine is pure as the driven snow, that much is obvious given your statements about biolabs and arms shipments.  But... given that I easily, with one quick google search, showed that your presumption was based on, let's be kind and say, faulty beliefs... I feel confident in stating that all your others beliefs, including your dismissal of populist isolationism, are equally faulty.So yea... Reaganism is a product of an era that ended four decades ago and it needs to be sent to the nursing home where we can listen to stories about it while we make decisions about the world today that are rooted in the current era.","title":"Zelenskyy Confirms Ukraine War Will End Sooner With Trump in Power"},{"text":"Too late for that...?","title":"Focus group: Swing voters wary of Musk-Trump relationship"},{"text":"Im curious if this is gonna be like when Trump proposed term limits on congress to drain the swamp but never went through with it.It was the one policy proposal of his I didnt hate and of course he didnt go through with it","title":"Bernie Sanders tentatively pledges to support cap on credit card interest rates proposed by Trump."},{"text":"They ARE the enemy within.

Currently there are 23 Democratic governors to 27 Republican governors. And even those Republican governors will want to keep their power; or might be limited due to Democratic controlled State houses for additional budget/resources.States like CA, NY, MA, etc can heavily resist Trump via their pretty significant State budgets due to large populations and economies. How far they go in resisting will be the question. We saw during COVID that governors would jump thru hoops to get the resources their State needed. An example from my own Massachusetts: https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/us/coronavirus-patriots-plane-masks-spt-trnd/index.htmlA Republican governor (light Republican, as is traditional in liberal States like MA) used a private jet (the patriots jet, lol) to get N95 masks because Trump was stealing supplies from Democratic States. Now MA has a Democratic governor, so stuff like that could happen.One tricky part is that the national guard can be federalized, so that trick that my state used for protecting the COVID masks wouldn't work. We still have a pretty large State police force though: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_State_PoliceNot sure that'll be enough to resist a federalized MA national guard tho: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_National_GuardBut it's something. Boston Mayor Wu also voiced support for immigrants: https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/2024-11-12/mayor-wu-says-boston-police-wont-have-to-assist-in-mass-deportations-under-trumpSo that's another couple thousand officers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Police_DepartmentMA went 61% for Kamala, so it's likely other small to large Cities would resist Trump too.The same could be true in CA, NY, etc. State police and local police may be told by their governors/Mayor's/State Houses/City Councilors/etc to not comply with Trump. It may lead to a civil war like thing if things go that far, but honestly more than likely Trump will hopefully just get bored and focus on red States or on a completely different issue that he can control somehow.

This also cements a dictators power as generally there are foreign backers who can use their outside currency to bolster your accounts. The populace as well can now no longer become as rich as you.\\nStep 2) Ferment political discourse. \\nGridlock is the goal. If the government cant agree, it cant function.

The person voted for is the representation of those who voted. They accept his bigotry, and are therefore complicit in all that he represents and every decision they make. That's what it means to cast your vote. At least that's what it means to me. I made my decision and I accept how that makes me look. But so many people try to minimize their vote to the point of not wanting to accept that this is what they look like to us outsiders. What we, the entire US body, looks like to outsiders. No, they made their choice. And if they can't accept even the simplest consequences, like being cut off by others, what business do they have making such an important decision to begin with? This recent decision could very well have terrible consequences, especially for those in those regions that voted for him.Non-voters, on the other hand, are a lot harder to generalize. They didn't make a decision. For whatever reason it may be, they didn't, or couldn't, make that decision. So, to me, they get a LOT more leniency. Trump doesn't represent them, because they didn't align with him, for whatever reason. Your vote = who you are allowing to represent you as a person to those who otherwise know nothing else about you. Your politics are who you are as a person.

Kennedy Jr. for HHS secretary."},{"text":"As to why the right wingers cornered this market and the left leaning side of the aisle did not even make an impact over the past 10-20 years, here's a long-ass thought about it.It's my legitimate belief that the modern American left wing zeitgeist has been to be so positive and welcoming and coddling to people, as their core value (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), that part of the identity of leftists and progressives has been to reject the idea that people are personally responsible for their failures and problems *and that maybe it's in your power, and you should hold yourself accountable, for fixing them*. It's alienating to imply people can be, or are, failures or have failed, especially when it comes to big ticket life items like careers or their body. This is the essence of \\"masculinity\\" imo, in my personal feeling of it - accepting you're in charge and what you want is YOUR fucking problem, and it's not \\"out of your control\\" until you say so - because you've given up responsibility, and now you're never gonna get the thing you wanted.Go talk about finances, career choices, personal fitness and weight, with the average progressive, especially on social media. You will probably hear, in order:1. nobody can afford shit, it's not my fault I'm poor at 30 years old, it's the boomers' fault, economy bad, life bad, america bad, not my problem/fault/responsibility 2. all careers should be paid better, it's not fair I majored in **enter humanities degree here** and don't make as much as the software dev3. I have a hormone imbalance, fuck you for implying my 50% body fat is not healthy and just as beautiful as Scarlett Johansson  \\nAll of it is language and discourse and personal ideology designed to take responsibility away from you, to make it impossible to regard yourself as *having failed*. You cannot be thought of as having failed, *some system or group failed you*. This is fucking insane, and toxic, and probably the biggest thing that makes me not want to hang out with left leaning people in most contexts - it's incredibly pervasive in my experience.Like, yeah, I'm a competitive dude. I was MISERABLE for many years thinking I was a failure. I'm not a failure anymore, and I've taken responsibility of even more things in my life and now I'm even more successful in more areas - and it feels fucking awesome! But I had to accept I was a fucking loser and needed to fix a LOT of things and that it was all my fault first - if it's not my fault and I have nothing to do with the failure, how and why would I ever fix it myself? Why would I listen to people telling me it wasn't my fault, society failed me, yada yada, and that's the cause of all my problems? That's maybe 10% of the story, for almost everybody - the other 90% is usually \\"you could do better.\\" I've literally never in my life heard a positive message about that come from a left leaning source. It's either angry (Bill Maher was mentioned elsewhere on this thread, LOL), or it's anti-responsibility (this is more common in my experience). Then you have people like Jordan Peterson, back in the day when he hadn't fried his brain on drugs yet, talking compassionately about taking personal responsibility, cleaning up your room, getting your life in order, and that it's OK to be a strong masculine dude who doesn't just mindlessly reject everything because it's a \\"social construct\\".Why are we surprised this message fucking works?  \\nThus you get meathead personal responsibility conservatives making fun of the hippy-dippy lefties who drink soymilk and weigh 300 lbs. You get conservative contrarians who want to personally grab life by the dick, and grab public policy by the dick, and STRANGLE IT UNTIL IT DOES WHAT THEY WANT, and lefties who talk endlessly about how bad everything is and how we can't let \\"the other\\" get away with it, and how much shared guilt we all have for XYZ identity, and how we have to tear down the system that failed us.  \\nThese are ALL stereotypes, but these stereotypes came about because this was a big trend on the internet for like, the past 15 years. It's finally come home to roost. The young shitlords on youtube in the 2010s are now young conservative voters.","title":"We Asked Young Men Why They Voted for Donald TrumpHeres What They Said"},{"text":"No. The knocking down walls comment is separate but related.

However, the land was broken into very small chunks - barely enough to grow enough for a family and certainly not big enough for anyone to earn a living selling extra produce.  Then there was the problem that the people didn't know how to farm.  So many ended up selling the land, i,e, the black \\"farmers\\" were essentially used (without their knowledge) as a means to confiscate land and eventually get it in in other hands all the while TPTB looking altruistic.  Oh - and the other thing was that the small farmers couldn't afford the property tax on their new land which was also a factor in their selling it.","title":"Trump Announces Planned Withdrawal from World Health Organisation and the Pandemic Preparedness Treaty"},{"text":"Epstein got him laid.\\nMusk I think he barely tolerates, but not sure?","title":"Bernie Sanders tentatively pledges to support cap on credit card interest rates proposed by Trump."},{"text":"Bernie isn't like any other politician.

Democratic senate candidates won races in states Trump won. That makes NO sense whatsoever. Look at how polarized we are. Split ticket voting just doesnt happen anymore.

Its a messaging issue. Republicans are not going to solve these issues. But theres enough men who feel shunned or outright attacked that theyll happily embrace Trump. On policy, the Democrats are much more willing to push occupational safety regulations that are written in blood. But the party is not messaging well to men, whereas the Republican Party actively sought out their votes - going directly to their spaces and communities to reach men. The effort to go onto podcasts, and win over the crypto bros and sports betting types was successful even if this might end up being a short-lived alliance (which isnt guaranteed), we cannot deny that it has yielded some results.In short, focus more on issues that men care about and message them. You dont even necessarily have to change the platform much, but you need to change the messaging to cater to your audience. Winning male and female voters requires different strategies.
