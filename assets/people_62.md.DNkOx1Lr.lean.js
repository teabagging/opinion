Maybe they're all wrong again but this time the other way due to overcorrection. About 2/3 of all polls are weighting by \\"recalled vote in 2020.\\" Going to be interesting to see if that makes them more or less accurate. Again, I'm not saying that Seltzer is right. I'm saying that if someone with her record is making this claim, it's at least considering that she could be right rather than dismissing it out of hand because it doesn't fit the existing or your preferred narrative.If this is a free and fair election Trump wins in a landslide. Problem is our elections are not free and fair anymore.There's really no evidence of this other than what you WANT to be true. The polls show that it's a toss up, including some BS polls conducted on behalf of each party. It could just as easily be a legit Harris landslide as it could a Trump one.I'll also point out that despite a bit of griping, elections were free and fair until 2020. Hillary bitched about \\"Russian interference\\" in 2016 but no one ever claimed there was actual cheating at the ballot box. Trump never claimed anything was wrong with the election that he won. Still no issue in the 2018 Midterms, which was a blue wave. Then 2020, Trump loses and suddenly the whole thing is rigged, though all the court cases went nowhere. 2022, Trump not running and it's more or less fine again. Now, here we are in 2024 and he basically claims that the election will only be free and fair if he wins. Just strikes me as incredibly disingenuous.Edit: [Conversely, if Jim Cramer is picking Harris to win, that probably means she's going to lose.](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/04/cramer-says-mondays-action-suggests-some-anticipate-a-harris-win.html) He has more wrong picks than Seltzer has right ones.","title":"Trump Is Going to Win The 2024 Election"},{"text":"Its all about their cult.

The poorer economic situation you've felt under Biden have been Trumps tax plan which expires in 2025, not Bidens. The better economy you experienced under Trump occurred entirely under Obama's plan.

In reality, the decline probably has a lot more to do with how people perceive organized religion.

This is the same for anyone, including Christians.  But for Christians, it means I would not hold a Christian to be hypocritical, nor even disingenuous, to vote for Trump or any antichrist.  I may disagree vehemently with the idea that Trump is the best choice for their desired policy goals.  But that's their decision and their vote.Where I begin to draw the line is when vote turns into **support**.  And I am vociferously against it when support turns into defense.Absolutely nobody claiming to follow the principles of Jesus or God (of any Abrahamic faith) should *defend* Trump.  Trump worships lies.  And most who defend him slip into the same far too easily.  You don't really need to go any further.  Why would any Christian desire willingly supporting the Father of Lies?!?  Beyond this, Trump is a disgusting individual - a poster child for every one of the seven deadly sins.  With Trump, there is no love, no empathy, no peace-making save for love of self and \\"peace\\" with those who worship Trump.  Those who sloppily toss out that God loves all or forgives all just embarrass themselves, especially since the \\"all\\" there just means there's no difference here between Harris and Trump so why not pick Harris who, since the bar is so low here, better exemplifies Jesus than Trump?This rot goes much, muuuuuuuch deeper than Trump, however.  Many people of faith need to examine themselves very deeply to see how and why they fell into idolatry so strongly.  I have a hunch.  It doesn't start with worship of Trump.  It starts with worship of **self**.  Folk want to believe they are \\"better\\" than others.  It's a quick downward slide there towards self-righteousness, defense of the tribe(cult, church, religion) which provides that repeated junkie-like fix of self-righteousness.  And from there, it's simply far too easy to fall for a con-man like Trump.","title":"Opinion: Christians who support Trump put themselves between a rock and a hard place"},{"text":"Anger is a poor word.

You can post up to four times per hour, even if all four are right after another.The websites leftists use to pay for downvotes charge by the downvote, rather than by the hour of labor. So more posts means you drain their pre-paid account more quickly. Because posts downvoted to zero tend to have more than one downvote, when there is more posts, paid brigading is more costly than when there are just a few posts, but with some upvotes.That is a strategy against paid brigading, but it is not as effective against volunteer brigading. To wear them out, youd need even more posts.When the brigading is really bad, the mods might consider putting a sticky note up announcing that the four posts per hour limit has been suspended temporarily. Then conservatives could just post dozens of links each at a time until eventually it wears out the brigade.Would this actually work? I dont know, but it would be interesting to give it a try.All leftists need is a credit card, and there are white collar workers in third world countries who will be happy to downvote whatever they want.Some Reddit users have described in the past spending what appears to be in the thousands of dollars on paid votes. It isnt cheap to put food on the table for hundreds of people halfway around the world.The cost of 50 downvotes is $16.99, which comes out to $0.3398 per downvote. According to?[https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country\\\\_result.jsp?country=India&amp;displayCurrency=USD](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=India&amp;displayCurrency=USD)?, one pound of white rice in India costs $0.33.I dont know how much of the fee actually reaches the base level worker, but even if it is only half, it still adds up over time.Paid Reddit voting makes you think about the kind of people who pay for downvotes. Same kind of people that might mess with an actual real life election.But I accept that Reddit is twisted as sort of a fact of life. What Id be interested in seeing is a stickied title modeled as a charitable drive.Like**Today lets try and feed people from far off lands. Posting frequency limit is suspended for the next 24 hours.

The Israeli Ambassador informed President Nixon that \\"very serious conclusions\\" may occur if the United States did not airlift supplies. Nixon complied. This is seen by some commentators on the subject as the first threat of the use of the Samson Option.So: Israel with a weak conventional military which can't defend its borders from Hamas/Hezbollah/Islamic Jihad/any hostile neighbor is actually scarier than the Israel that exists now.If you are choosing between Harris and Trump over the Israel/Palestine question, you can be miserably disappointed by Harris, or you can spend your nights praying that Trump or his End-times fanatic fascist successor doesn't get a few billion people killed.","title":"Trump would be the worst: Palestinians react to US presidential race"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/wn6gba44a0zd1.jpeg?width=1512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=199c8dfd84afd77b287926409111abf7304224c9","title":"Anyone else extremely worried about the election"},{"text":"well, they are okay with voting gop still.https://pasquines.us/2024/11/04/jenniffer-gonzalez-colon-pablo-jose-hernandez-in-the-lead-of-puerto-ricos-gubernatorial-and-resident-commissioner-races/\\"Gonzalez-Colon is a \\"lifelong Republican and activist for Puerto Rican statehood.\\" Gonzalez-Colon was previously the chairwoman of the Republican Party of Puerto Rico.\\"","title":"On eve of election, Washington GOP tells Spanish-speaking voters Democrats hate you and hate God"},{"text":"my hopes for the future are also \\"pegged to this guy and that could all just dissolve tomorrow night\\".  if he wins, i believe we are fucked. so in a way i'm not so different from trump's followers.","title":"Trumps Followers Are Living in a Dark Fantasy"},{"text":"I wonder which way they voted","title":"Trump Campaign unspooling down the stretch?"},{"text":"I got a bit teary eyed.

It essentially is the same outcome, but with a higher return for the citizen, and reduces gov deficit. I guess a run on bonds would be a bad thing, but if you timed them out 6mo/1yr bonds you could manage the short panic. \\nLol, there is nothing natural about economics. Regardless of the system, its all a human invention.  Austrians love to try and claim that their ideology is the natural one and that attempts to optimize this human invention called the economy are fruitless. Its natural in the sense they dont alter anything and simply let the market work itself out. Its like the wildfires you see in California. The government made it illegal to clear brush or log old timber and when the dry season came around you get these massive statewide fires because theres just so much bio mass in the environment from underbrush and old dead trees. What couldve been a smaller manageable fire turned into something much worse because of regulated intervention. \\nThe boom and bust cycle was devastating. Trying to smooth out the cycle was a necessary development alongisde industrialization. We are not an agrarian society any more.It was devastating because we tried to smoothe it out! The main cause of the Great Depression was an over reaction of the fed contracting the money supply too fast. Other wise it wouldve been a much smaller recession. \\nAt its most basic form, like any system, there are sources and drains. Government spending is a source. Taxes are the drain. The idea that a large, advanced society can function with no taxes is just as ideologically drive nonsense as communism can work in practice - both are the headcannon of ideologues.It certainly could, but youd have to keep the federal government expidentures in check.

America's neo-Nazi poster boy!  And his support is unironic!  From the article linked:\\"In the video, he discussed what voting for a candidate means to him, saying you have to consider 'who best offers stability, safety, continuation, and most likely to be the best manager of the American empire.'\\"He continued: 'When I put it that way, the choice is very clear. I think Donald Trump and the MAGA \\\\[Make America Great Again\\\\] movement bring nothing but stupidity and chaos.'\\"And he has had negative views on Trump for at least a year, because I saw a video where he interviewed Nick Fuentes last November and even then they frequently referred to the silliness surrounding, and emanating, from Trump (although Fuentes credits Trump for awakening his alt-right political views).Which is all to say, if Richard Fucking Spencer, the poster boy of American neo-Nazis, is sick and tired of Trump's chaos and administrative incompetence, *so much so that he's willing to vote for a* woman *of color and urge others to do so as well*, you can assume he's not alone.I was nervous until I saw his endorsement.

With its 19 electoral college vote, it is the biggest prize of the seven key swing states and the one politicos will be watching to determine the outcome of the election.Despite arriving more than an hour and a half late, the former president buoyed up the crowd with his opening gambit. Channelling former President Ronald Regan, Trump opened with a question to voters: Are you better off than you were four years ago?Regan famously asked this question to the American people in the closing argument of his debate against incumbent Jimmy Carter in the 1980 election and went on to win. My message to Americans tonight is simple, Trump continued. We do not have to live this way.He compared his vision of Americas economic prosperity with four more years of misery, failure and disaster that he claimed voters will face under Ms Harris.Addressing the crisis at the border, Trump vowed to stop drugs pouring into America from Mexico, pointing out that 300,000 Americans die every year due to drugs coming from the country.Citing Fentanyl as the most dangerous example of drugs being trafficked from Mexico, he also vowed to follow Chinas lead in bringing drug dealers to justice quicker.Recalling a conversation with Chinese President Xi Jing Ping, who he said he got on with well, Trump said he would adopt a Chinese justice policy called quick trial that fast tracks drugs offences through courts.He added that he told President Xi that if China bought one barrel of oil from Iran, they would never do business again.Raising concerns about election fraud, a repeated refrain of Trump rallies, the former president predicted it could take 12 days for the election result to be announced. He also claimed it would be better to remove electronic voting machines altogether and revert to paper ballots, which he praised as very sophisticated.In a further prediction of the election result, Trump claimed the Democrats have given up hope in North Carolina, the swing state where polls suggest he holds a narrow lead.The word is theyve pulled out of North Carolina, they cut all their ads and theyre using the money some place else, he alleged.The former president sought to project an image to voters of a family man, inviting his children on stage at one point to embrace him.He was also joined by the son of legendary Puerto Rican baseball player Roberto Clemente, roaring, I love Puerto Rico,as he did so.The decision to invite Mr Clemente Jr on stage marked a continuation of Trumps charm offensive towards the Puerto Rican community after a warm-up act at one of his recent rallies referred to the country as a floating island of garbage.Puerto Ricans including the actress Jennifer Lopez were among those to condemn the comments.In a rebuke of businessman Mark Cuban, who claimed the Trump was scared of strong, intelligent women, the former president also invited TV personality Megyn kelly to join him.Ms Kelly launched a scathing attack of Kamala Harris husband Doug Emhoff, claiming he bullies his wife the vice president.You see that ad they did about Trump voters trying to encourage women to lie to their husbands so that they could vote for her instead of Trump. Thats their version of what marriage looks like: an overbearing husband who bullies his wife into saying she voted one way, as opposed to an honest, open relationship, she said.Oh wait, Im talking about Kamala and Doug.Trump has finished his speech in Pittsburgh by channelling his former role as the host of the Apprentice, saying: Lets fire Kamala.After speaking for nearly two hours at the PPG Paints Arena, he added: We will stop immigration once and for all, we will not be invaded. Everyone will prosper and every day will be filled with optimism and hope.Urging supporters to get out and vote tomorrow, he said: This nation belongs to you.We will never back down and we will never surrender. Fight fight fight.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/04/donald-trump-rally-live-updates-pittsburgh-pennsylvania/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/04/donald-trump-rally-live-updates-pittsburgh-pennsylvania/)","title":"Lets fire Kamala says Donald Trump in penultimate rally in Pennsylvania"},{"text":"Can you summarize the argument?I dont care to listen","title":"Joe Rogan endorses Trump on eve of Election Day"},{"text":"So the stupidest podcaster endorsed the stupidest president.

They hate you, they hate your family, they hate God and they hate the truth, the message sent Friday reads in Spanish, referring to three Latina Democrats running in the majority-Hispanic 14th legislative district, which was redrawn in a contentious redistricting process that has angered Republicans.Meanwhile, the state GOP sent an English-language message to voters in southwest Washingtons 3rd Congressional District, where Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez  a Democrat who has repeatedly bucked her own party while representing a district that former President Donald Trump won in 2020  is in a high-profile rematch with Republican Joe Kent. That message, sent with an image of the communist hammer-and-sickle symbol on a rainbow background, calls the freshman congresswoman a Democrat socialist and claims that she lives in Portland and supports defund the police, abortion until birth, castrating minor children/confusing them about their gender, higher taxes, and less efficient government spending. A spokesman for the Gluesenkamp Perez campaign, Phil Gardner, said the message is typical of the kooky outright lies Joe Kent and his far-right supporters tell about Marie. In a statement, Gardner said Gluesenkamp Perez obviously does not live in Portland and is endorsed by the Washington Council of Police and Sheriffs, because of her strong support for the police.","title":"On eve of election, Washington GOP tells Spanish-speaking voters Democrats hate you and hate God"},{"text":"Sure. lets break it down.

For the record, virtually every source that covered the Unite the Right debacle concluded that it was conceived of, led by and attended by white supremacists, and that therefore Trumps characterization was wrong.","title":"Mysterious bronze neo-Nazi tiki torch for Trump statue appears in Washington DC: Very fine people: The satirical effigy C which sits only a few blocks from the White House on Freedom Plaza C pays tribute to Trump and the very fine people who marched through Charlottesville in 2017"},{"text":"Good for him","title":"Joe Rogan just endorsed Donald Trump"},{"text":"In the end the jab comes for us all, so it is written Dumbassitcus 14:3","title":"And If You Ever Need Plasma, Hope You Have the Right Friends"},{"text":"Seriously like that mail and text where Elons minions pretend to be the Harris campaign and lie about their policies like how tf is that legal.","title":"On eve of election, Washington GOP tells Spanish-speaking voters Democrats hate you and hate God"},{"text":"The GOP had a comedian call a Spanish speaking territory garbage and they were fine with it.Theyre really trying to pull all the gaslighting stops now at the final hour.","title":"On eve of election, Washington GOP tells Spanish-speaking voters Democrats hate you and hate God"},{"text":"all the fluent english russians are at the front right now, we got the B group propagandists....","title":"Trump would be the worst: Palestinians react to US presidential race"},{"text":"Ok","title":"Trump says Federal Taxes are a scam.

I find solace that Kamala ran a damn near perfect campaign. Trump has the far right (no salvaging that voting bloc). But he did nothing to expand his base and ran one of the worst campaigns Ive seen in my lifetime. With that, Kamala needed to fit everyone from leftists to center-right moderates under her tent. I think she did a great job at messaging to everyone in those demos *and* staying positive, joyful, and confident. Her VP pick is one of the most likable politicians in the modern era.

Money doesnt just exist in the ether, unattached from an owner. Someones supply needs to be burned. Thats a part of taxes. Mechanisms like QE, fractional banking with low interest, etc. Introduce supply. Taxes burn supply. Its a necessary mechanism because the goal is also very slight inflation to provide a mild buffer because inflation rates fluctuate and deflation can cause a death spiral. And also it adds some velocity.I dont know what youre not understanding about this. Currency and money are different things. If you have a total supply on the books of 7 trillion or whatever and 50 years ago you only had a couple billion, $1 of the billion is worth a lot more than $1 of the 7 trillion. Now obviously theres not 7 trillion notes of paper money floating around because it would take life times to print that much in the denominations we have, so you carry balances on a ledger and keep track of everything that way, which means maybe 10% of total supply is tangible currency. So if you burn off a percentage of that 7 trillion, you havent taken money from anyone, youve just increased the value of the remaining supply. This also increases the cost of your debts, but thats another discussion altogether. Were strictly talking about the effects of burning the supply. But the world is dynamic. Populations change. The economy grows (and shrinks). Imports and exports vary. There needs to be supply and drain mechanisms to account for the dynamic nature of an economy to target price stability.Theres a term for this already that Keynesian and MMTers hate to hear. Its called the boom and bust cycle, a perfectly natural, self regulating,  and necessary market function. You see the former schools of thought believe that they can micro and macro adjust rates and securities on the fly to provide a smoothe landing in economic recessions, but they really just fuel the ever burning flame of deficit with more debt and continue to kick the can down the road until one day an economic fall out happens that makes the Great Depression look like a hiccup.  All of which couldve been avoided by just accepting smaller economic downturns during bust cycles. Crypto is actually the perfect example of why deflation is bad. HODL is terrible for a currency.And so is printing trillions of dollars. Im not making a case for crypto, I was making a comparison.","title":"Trump says Federal Taxes are a scam.

On my own street, three of my neighbors removed their signs one by one as she continued to bumble and stumble her way through her teleprompted campaign, it's not that they aren't still voting for her, but they're damn sure not as proud of it.At work I spent seven years in a position as the lone white person on my crew, before my promotion in September, and slowly but surely over the last two years I've watched all but two of them turn from heavily negative on Trump and become vocal supporters and voters for him.A lot of people in Virginia are sick of the rhetoric without results that the Dems have slung over our state for years and years.  Youngkin showed a lot of Virginia that the Governor's chair isn't just a free paycheck for some scumbag to do nothing in, and the events of London County still ring through the schools across the state.I will personally be surprised if we go full red, but I don't think we're going to be as blue as people seem to think.  Our polls were tainted by the fact that the Virginia native is the minority of the states population because of so many interstate migrants (New Jersey, New York, etc.). and initially many of them packed their politics with their pants, but I think finally some are waking up to what ruined their home states, and I hope they can course correct before they ruin mine.","title":"Prediction for Trump and Harris victory tomorrow.

It sounds like the person I responded to is in a far off state, so again, why do they get priority in who I or the protest voters care about?  In my state, a state where the protest vote is among the loudest in the nation, we legalized abortion.  It's interesting that the person I responded to isn't more concerned about voters in her state getting the legislation passed there or pushing a change in their governorship.  It's weird that rather than blaming her governorship... she's blaming people demanding a change to a policy that's resulting in one of the worst atrocities in the history of the world.Interesting enough, many of the protest votes are Arabs and Jews... who have family in those regions who are absolutely being affected.  Many have lost family members to this massacre.  Jews without families there, OTOH, are still being impacted by Israel's and the Democratic establishment's constant equivocation of Israelis / Zionists to the Jewish ethnicity, even as those Jews protest against the atrocities.  All of the above are labeled as anti-Semites for defending innocent people and calling out Israel's actions.So yes, it actually does matter a lot to a lot of people.The problem with your argument is also that it's not simply a conflict; it quickly devolved into an ethnic cleansing / genocide.  It also isn't just the conflict itself, but the US' funding and support of that conflict with billions of dollars paid for by US taxpayers.Based on your response, sorry to say, those whining the loudest about the protest voters seem to be the least informed on the matter.It never occurred to you to actually ask why this issue has people so upset as to decline to vote for Harris / Democrats... has it?  Instead, you attempt to tear people down for making their own choices as to what's important to them.I also find it odd that you seem to suggest it's the voters who are the only responsible party in this voting conflict, and not also bring up that there's been a clear failure in the Democratic party's response to this voting conflict.  Why has there not been a change in policy that would lead to these voters opting to vote for Harris?  It's weird, I've asked this question many times and yet... I never get a response...Seems like tribalism to me.  Siding with one's party and treating them as perfect... rather than questioning their actions... and blaming everyone else.","title":"Trump would be the worst: Palestinians react to US presidential race"},{"text":"I want to 100% believe.

Its teeny tiny potatoes compared to what the US government has gotten away with in countries around the world. Does the US look the other way when Israel does all kinds of awful things?? Hell yes. The\\nIS government has been and continues to try to convince an entire population that Israels genocide isnt that big of a deal. They constantly downplay all the bs Israel has been doing for decades to the Palestinians.  (note: I have to say to the Palestinians, not Palestine because the US and Israel dont recognize Palestine as a state and in spite of the fact that the vast majority of the world says Palestine ought to be recognized as a state) The US looks the other way and acts like Israels barbaric treatment of Palestine is bad, but heres some more bombs and money to do it some more. The list of criminal behavior the US has done around the world is massive. The US expects the US population and the world to pretend their imperialism is a okay because its the US doing it and they are just bringing Democracy to the world. ?? The US also, as a favor, to governments who are willing to do their bidding, will look the other way when other governments do criminal behavior. The US letting a country slide on relatively minor things is not an indication that that country is the boss of the US. How someone could come to the conclusion that Israel controls the US, to me means you dont understand the control the US has over the entire world. Israel controls the US, but the US controls the rest of the world? Israel has minuscule influence around the world in comparison. If the US decided tomorrow to stop sending bombs and money to Israel, Israel would suddenly become completely and utterly powerless. You think that US power is dependent on Israel? Yes, Israel influences our government, but thats mostly to buy politicians to continue to support Israels control over Palestinian people. Israel is one tool the US uses to have world dominance. Israel helps the US have world dominance. But you think the  its the other way around? Israel controls the world and the US? Little old Israel does that? What historical evidence do you have besides your previous example, which as I said before its tiny potatoes. Im sorry, maybe Im beating a dead horse, but I have heard that people think this, but Ive never had the opportunity to have dialogue with someone who thinks this, so Im intrigued. How does this logic work? How does someone come to this conclusion? Is this stemming from an antisemitic trope that some in the US have, thinking the Jews rule the world? What political ideation do you have? Libertarian? Or what? Im really trying to figure this out. Not just about you and your beliefs, but theres a body of people who think this way, and Im trying to understand where this line of logic stems from.","title":"US should collectively disown Trump."},{"text":"[Jimmy Carter would be pissed.](https://theonion.com/you-people-made-me-give-up-my-peanut-farm-before-i-got-1819585048/)","title":"Team Trumps Final Plea to Voters Is, Frankly, Nuts"},{"text":"Even if she went on the podcast, there is no way in fuck that Joe Rogan would ever endorse her.","title":"Joe Rogan Endorses Trump on Eve of Election"},{"text":"Truly auditioning to be a dictator.","title":"BREAKING: Donald Trump declares he has a 96.2% chance of winning the election tomorrow"},{"text":"Trump's other climate change plan: nuclear warming?","title":"Climate skeptics are hatching big plans for a second Trump term"},{"text":"Bad mix of drugs, money, fame, narcissism, not too bright and a dash of persecution complex.

A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. Americas most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washingtons humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincolns moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trumps conductboth during his tenure and specifically on January 6threveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trumps character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384473246_The_Character_and_Eligibility_of_Donald_Trump_A_Critical_Examination/stats","title":"Trump appears to reference vulgar Access Hollywood remarks in closing statements to supporters"},{"text":"It's the bare minimum if you ask me - the basic values that we should all share.","title":"Trumps Followers Are Living in a Dark Fantasy"},{"text":"lol you probably actually believe that crap","title":"Joe Rogan Endorses Donald Trump Night Before Election"},{"text":"What a goober","title":"Joe Rogan Endorses Donald Trump Night Before Election"},{"text":"Begging at next level!","title":"My final post on this sub!"},{"text":"Not an answer.

A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. Americas most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washingtons humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincolns moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trumps conductboth during his tenure and specifically on January 6threveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trumps character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384473246_The_Character_and_Eligibility_of_Donald_Trump_A_Critical_Examination/stats","title":"Trump appears to reference vulgar Access Hollywood remarks in closing statements to supporters"},{"text":"if Harris wins it is time to turn the heat way up on climate action To meet the quickly accelerating risks.

The author lays out many very good reasons why Trump should absolutely never be president again. Also the differing viewpoints of those who support Trump and how he and his campaign are using either conspiracy theories, misinformation, and lies to obfuscate their true intentions with a Trump presidency. And maybe most importantly how those policies will gravely impact and hurt **not just** liberals, women, minorities, LGBTQ, and immigrants, but also many of the very people who support Trump. Honestly the case is laid out very thoroughly in this article. Please give it a read if youre genuinely curious. Maybe the only thing not covered in there is how his proposed tariffs will skyrocket prices for all Americans, increasing inflation, hurting small businesses, and allow for the ultra wealthy to swoop in and buy up even more companies at dirt cheap prices - ya know when Elon Musk confirmed the economy might be bad for a few years. Meaning a few billionaires could own even more of our businesses and corporations, most of the real estate and then most Americans would be subjugated as feudal servants with no worker rights - see Project 2025 for more exciting plans of a second Trump presidency.","title":"Trumps Followers Are Living in a Dark Fantasy"},{"text":"Its just a right wing incestuous food chain.","title":"Joe Rogan announces endorsement of Trump while promoting Elon Musk interview on X"},{"text":"Mean the maha stuff","title":"What if Trump won?"},{"text":"In other words, they investigated themselves and found no wrong doing.

That toll in just one year of conflict, and that's just the informal count of the dead.  There are said to potentially be tens of thousands still buried in the rubble.  I won't bother getting into the count of the injured, the percentage of the city that was destroyed (including people losing just about everything they had in the world), or the forced famine due to lack of aid.I also won't get into the fact that this is now escalating into Lebanon, Syria, and Iran.But real quick... you be the judge.  What happens if this conflict escalates to all surrounding nations and the US gets dragged into the war?  How many American soldiers are we willing to lose?  How many innocent civilians are we willing to bomb?You suggest that our \\"virtue signaling\\"... 'our' which includes US women... is worth more than your life and your rights.  Well, to be blunt... I know you as much as I know all those people who died in Gaza.. which is to say, I don't know any of you.  So ... why should you be more important to me than they are?I'll just point out that many, even potentially most people supporting Gaza also defend women's rights to choose.  I mean, afterall, these are the same left leaning voters that would have voted Harris if not for this issue of the Democratic party and the Democratic presidential administration actively supporting an ongoing genocide...It's weird you place all the blame on these particular voters though.  Are you suggesting that the Democratic party couldn't have supported both US women AND Palestinian civilians?  That they couldn't have at least offered a bone?  That they couldn't have constrained themselves from calling these voters, those who called out Israel's abhorrent actions or defended Palestinians, anti-Semites.  That includes Jews btw... which I don't know if you're Jewish.. .but that's quite an insult to call Jews anti-Semites...aka Jew haters.Those politicians are completely aware of why this group is opting not to vote for them.  They know full well, but they still refuse to change their stance.  Why is that?  Why don't you cast any blame at them?I guess my question is... why are you putting women's bodily rights above the rights of nearly 2.2 million people who are currently living in a severe situation?  Why don't you find the second issue as important as the first... choosing to stand with those of us who find both issues important, and demanding the Democrat party change their policy or else risk losing your vote.\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_Edit: I'll just add.  We passed abortion rights in my state.  Why is it the people in my state's fault that your state restricted abortion rights?  Maybe the people of your state need to work on getting an amendment passed, or maybe a change in leadership?  As much as I think a lot of people believe Harris will magically fix abortion rights, or codify them at the federal level... no one thinks Democrats will get a majority in both of houses of congress, needed to legalize abortion at the federal level.  Therefore, I fail to see what Harris could do that Biden couldn't have already done.  I also fail to see what Trump could do.  He equally doesn't have access to ban abortion at the federal level since he doesn't have the necessary congressional votes.  It would take two conservative Supreme Court Justices retiring or dying in the next 4 years to enable Harris to replace both with liberal justices who will re-enable Roe.  Chances of that happening are extremely slim.  In fact, it's more likely to happen 4-8 years from now than it is to happen over the next 4.  Therefore, it's far more critical for Democrats to get a victory in 2028 than it is to get an issue in 2024 on that particular issue.See what happens when we start considering the full picture?","title":"Trump would be the worst: Palestinians react to US presidential race"},{"text":"tons of people in this country are uneducated and are easily brainwashed.","title":"As Trump brags \\"every rally is full,\\" cameraman pans over empty arena"},{"text":"The Democrats never listen to their voters, they only listen to the \\"moderate\\" Republicans they make up in their heads.

All this is moot if democrats won the house, so hopefully that happens","title":"Thousands of Trump supporters mobilized to block election certification"},{"text":"asstro-","title":"A Grim Trump and an Upbeat Harris End the Race Hitting Opposite Notes"},{"text":"I worry about the possibility that Donald Trump will win the 'old fashioned way', but even more that he might win through some bizarre trickery.  In particular, Eli Mystal has unlocked [a new fear](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/little-secret-trump-johnson-election/) that the Republicans will employ skullduggery and a novel reading of the constitution to win the electoral vote by lowering the number of electors who are actually counted, thus the number needed for a majority....I think the plan is to steal the Electoral College outright by getting states Trump loses to refuse to certify the results of their election. Thats because the 12th Amendment provides that the president is the person who wins the majority of the whole number of Electors appointed. That whole number is supposed to be 538. But one *potential* reading of the amendment is that Trump doesnt have to win 270 Electoral College votes but just a *majority* of however many electors show up. Trumps goal, I believe, is to decrease the number of electors appointed until he wins.This reading is untested. Nobody has yet tried to win an election with fewer than a majority of the Electoral College votes by decreasing the overall number of electors appointed after the election. But its an argument the Trump team could put forward, and its an argument Democratic lawyers and experts are preparing for.The first step in such a process is to get Republicans in states Trump loses to contest the certification of their own elections. In 2020, Trump and his team illegally tried to get slates of alternate electors submitted in states where Republicans control the state legislatures. They could try that again, but for this scheme to work, they dont even have to get fake electors submitted but just to convince Republican state legislatures or Republican governors not to submit their valid slates of electors before statutorily imposed deadlines. All slates of electors are supposed to be certified by December 11. Those electors are then supposed to vote and submit their results by December 25.What this means is that Republicans just have to delay long enough to pass those deadlines. They dont have to win; they just have to stall.Before this, there might well be chaos and violence, although I hope that enough Trump cultists will be too chickenshit to pursue what they profess to crave.  There will surely be threats, at least.  In 2020 Donald Trump threatened the family of Al Schmidt, who was then a [City Commissioner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_City_Commissioners) of Philadelphia, precisely because despite being a Republican, he assiduously and faithfully executed his office.  Now his is [Secretary of the Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_the_Commonwealth_of_Pennsylvania), which could make him an even greater target for Republican rage.  Elected officers who are responsible for administering elections in Philadelphia.  There are three and no party is allowed to hold more than two of the seats.  Commissioner Schmidt was the sole Republican in 2020; his protg  Seth Bluestein holds that distinction now.","title":"Anyone else extremely worried about the election"},{"text":"They're not \\"skeptics\\", they're \\"deniers\\".","title":"Climate skeptics are hatching big plans for a second Trump term"},{"text":"Its worse than the historical appeasement youre alluding to: theyre appeasing the prospective dictator to protect their bottom line at the cost of our democracy and human rights.

Youre the first ones Ive told it to.He later added that the plan has a 100 per cent chance of working because?[he would ratchet up the rate](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/11/03/win-for-trump-unleash-wave-inflation-voters-feared/)?if Mexico refused.If that doesnt work, Ill make it 50, and if that doesnt work, Ill make it 75, he said. Then Ill make it 100.Trumps plan to use tariffs as an aggressive weapon in his foreign policy arsenal has caused alarm among economists, who said they amounted to a consumer tax on everyday imported goods.Mexico is the USs largest trading partner, and exports billions of dollars of computers, cars and machinery north each year.Last week, John Paulson, a billionaire hedge fund manager, suggested that Trumps plan for double-digit tariffs on all countries was part of a negotiating strategy to secure other foreign policy aims.Vivek Ramaswamy, a former Republican primary contender who now serves as a Trump campaign surrogate, said the same in a recent interview.However, Trump has gone further to suggest he would ultimately like to scrap federal income tax and replace the revenue with money generated from tariffs.Kamala Harriss campaign has said his plans would amount to thousands of dollars of price rises for average Americans, because the increased import costs would be passed on to consumers by retailers.Trump has suggested that Mexico is responsible for illegal migration in all three of his presidential campaigns, including his 2016 run in which he famously pledged to build a border wall and make Mexico pay.During his first administration, however, he signed a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. His plan to impose tariffs to bring down illegal migration would contravene the deal he signed in office.Trumps $300 billion tariffs on China from his first term are more popular, and have largely been maintained by the Biden administration. Earlier this year, Joe Biden announced plans for a 100 per cent tariff on Chinese electric vehicle imports to support domestic manufacturers.In 2022, Mr Biden negotiated a new border deal with the Mexican government, which agreed to spend $1.5 billion upgrading its security measures. Mexico never paid for Trumps border wall.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/04/donald-trump-says-could-impose-100-per-cent-tariff-mexico/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/04/donald-trump-says-could-impose-100-per-cent-tariff-mexico/)","title":"Donald Trump says he could impose 100 per cent tariffs on Mexico"},{"text":"Between Musk, RFK Jr, Heschel Walker, and now this - Trump apparently wants to staff his team with people who will race to run this country into the ground","title":"Climate skeptics are hatching big plans for a second Trump term"},{"text":"You can also be Key pilled, also fun","title":"Anyone else extremely worried about the election"},{"text":"it's extra hilarious after the past few years of them covering for Biden and gaslighting everyone for pointing out the obvious.","title":"Sick of all the news painting trump as tired."},{"text":"Do they have golf in the penitentiary?","title":"Donald Trump should accept result and go play golf if Kamala Harris wins, says Nigel Farage"},{"text":"Democrats usually lead in early voting right?","title":"Trump Campaign Memo Describes Massive Turnout Deficit For Dems On Eve of Election"},{"text":"And were all going to pay a price.","title":"Climate skeptics are hatching big plans for a second Trump term"},{"text":"Everything she stands for (increased taxes on wealthy, increased regulation on corporations, better public education, Medicare for all, pro Palestine, etc) is the opposite of Trump.

The reason that I say this is that Rasmussen and a few others are very clear about their methodology. They aren't overestimating any \\"hidden\\" (or \\"guessed\\") Trump voters. That would really destroy the credibility of a poll. Rather, Rasmussen is simply making a traditional \\"likely voter\\" based upon previous turnout. Within that, they do account for some voter enthusiasm indicators. This is where polls like NY Times-Siena are flawed (in my opinion). Since Joe Biden dropped out of the election, this small subset of pollsters perceive a higher enthusiasm for Kamala Harris than I believe is accurate. They base this on favorability and a gap between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. On average, Kamala Harris has a 4.1% better favorability compared with President Trump. However, there are some outlier polls -- and they tend to be the same polls that are favoring Kamala Harris. Marist, NY Times-Siena and a few others even give her a positive rating (meaning more people like her than dislike her). However, most other polls show her favorability index quite negative -- with some having it at or under President Trump's negatives. The problem, of course, is that this is a NATIONAL index rather than a state index. The only favorability that matters is within each of the battleground states. In those, I suspect President Trump polls higher than  nationally. The question is whether Kamala Harris would poll more negative or even with President Trump. Both (negative and even) would bode poorly for her in terms of potential enthusiasm. Personally, I think that the Hill and Atlas polls are more likely. The only possible exception is with Michigan and (potentially) Nevada. President Trump would still win with Pennsylvania (and/or Wisconsin). Moreover, if Trump overperforms the polls half as well as he did in 2020 in the battleground states, then I think that he will win all of the battleground states.","title":"Final 2024 Electoral College and National Poll Predictions"},{"text":"Trump would get \\"no tax on tips\\" done just like his other campaign promise of Mexico paying for a border wall.","title":"Just walked into Publix, someones sticking trump on weiners."},{"text":"Youre exactly right.

It's a necessary mechanism because the goal is also *very slight* inflation to provide a mild buffer because inflation rates fluctuate and deflation can cause a death spiral. And also it adds some velocity. But the world is dynamic. Populations change. The economy grows (and shrinks). Imports and exports vary. There needs to be supply and drain mechanisms to account for the dynamic nature of an economy to target price stability.Crypto is actually the perfect example of why deflation is bad.
