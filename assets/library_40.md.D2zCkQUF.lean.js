Not paying your kid's aliments? Without clarification, that's nothing I can honestly debate.    The main problem with deporting is: The more criminal a person is, the harder they are to find. I see it in my country - the guys who go to work everyday (or volunteer if they aren't allowed to work) are easiest to find (at their work), and when agencies have quotas to fill (this is how agencies operate) they start with the low hanging fruit. So the regular Joes are deported for minor stuff while the true criminals hide until this month's quota is filled.   Also, there's something economically wrong with deporting people: The USA heavily relies on immigrant work. So this will either drive up prices, drive down wages, or cause lots of unemployment (because the \\"unqualified\\" work enabling the qualified work isn't being done) - or combinations of the above.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"He will arrest the rich people he hates, seize their assets and push them out of windows, like Putin does.Eventually, he will hate all the rich people.","title":"Trump vows to use US military for mass deportations"},{"text":"I definitely wouldnt be comfortable being in a bathroom with her","title":"Nancy Mace introduces bill to bar trans women from Capitol restrooms"},{"text":"So that's what that weird, giggity feeling in my innards is.

I hate this freaking nuclear war fear mongering, nobody is going to ever fire a nuke, especially not russia.   And why would russia even attack the united states?  It makes no sense, countries sell/trade weapons to each other all the time, that has never caused anyone to declare war on someone selling weapons.     \\nNuclear weapons are more powerful as a \\"threat\\" because of gullible people thinking they will destroy the world.  Nuclear weapons are not that powerful.    Even if Russia Launched every nuke at the united states, Most of them would be shot down, and the few that hit would only take a small fraction of americans lives.  This would instantly mean every WESTERN country instantly going to war with russia and attacking with everything they had.  Russia would literally be wiped off the globe.  Russia/Putin doesn't want to lose their country or die.  They want to take over ukraine for its resources to grow more powerful.  Commiting Suicide would not help towards that goal.  Nuclear Weapons only help them as a threat.  As long as they can use them to threaten and slow aid, its working,  using a nuke is the complete opposite of what they want.  Even if it just \\"slows\\" aid, or makes people think twice, its an effect tactic to just keep threatening with nuclear weapons.Not to mention russia knows Trump is Pro-Russia and is coming into office Jan 20th, All they have to do is wait 2 months.  Why would they do start something they can't back out of before then?Putin has made these same threats since the war began, if you do X we will nuke you, or declare war, or whatever, and everytime HE ESCALATES the war and american responds, and he doesn't do anything he said.Russia's nuclear policy is only for use to protect its sovereignty, and they didn't even use nukes when Ukraine invaded them because it would only hurt their position and wouldnt do anything to stop ukraine troops.  And i'm not sure if anyone remembers, but we have literally been at war with Soviet Union Via Proxy wars, I.E. Korea/Vietnam, etc, and that INVOLVED our troops directly being there, and nobody fired nukes.  Ukraine is fighting Russia, American is not.

My SECOND ER that I went to (the first I walked away after 6 hours of nothing), I ended up stuck there in literal hell for like 36 hours I believe.

There are really very, very many laws that define crimes - with real penalties including jail time - that are simply not enforced in most cases.There are so many things that people don't even realize are a crime. For example: in some jurisdictions, having *your own* prescribed pills in your pocket/purse/etc can result in a felony with up to a year of jail time.And of course the prosecution rate is something like 0.01%. The problem is that the existence of such a law, combined with the policy you propose, means that any officer who happens to dislike a given immigrant (or immigrants in general) can decide to enforce that law *in that case*.And then they can say \\"look, this immigrant did a drug crime, they should get deported\\" - and most people who hear about it will imagine a drug dealer peddling on the street or a junkie with a bag of needles or something, and will say \\"well of course drug criminals should get deported.\\"You might say \\"well fix that law\\".

But that's also dependent on regulation by governments.[But one key difference that often ](https://focus.cbbc.org/how-is-chinas-version-of-tiktok-different/)gets overlooked is Douyin vs TikToks e-commerce capabilities. In 2022, Douyin generated 1.5 trillion RMB (over 175 billion) from e-commerce within the app, with 33% of its users below the age of 25. Thats a lot of click-happy teenage shoppers. Meanwhile, TikToks e-commerce capabilities have barely begun. It wasnt until October last year that Axios reported the company had posted job adds relating to TikToks development of an international e-commerce fulfilment system to rival Amazons C meaning it will be a while yet before the Wests young people are sucked into the frictionless, in-app shopping experience that has been so successful in China.Nevertheless, earlier this month, the UKs Information Commissioners Office fined TikTok 12.7 million C one of the largest ever issued C for illegally processing the data of 1.4 million children under the age of 13 who were using the platform without parental consent. The fine relates to a period in 2020, and Bytedance insists they have made significant changes to verify childrens ages since then.Ultimately then, it seems that Bytedance behaves no differently when operating in China as Douyin as it does in the West as TikTok C or any of Silicon Valleys biggest players for that matter: **companies are reluctant to make changes before being required to by law.**There's this whole thing of, for example, Australia wanting to ban social media to under 16s or whatnot, but that would mean no more educational youtube videos.

Most countries wouldn't accept these people back, especially if said criminal doesn't have any ties to his \\"original country\\". Why would they? They were born and/or raised in a different country. Despite their mistakes, most of them pay taxes that everybody gains from.Knowing Trump and his minions, he would use any loophole to frame people he doesn't want in the US. It's really easy to bust someone for drugs for example. Any charges also need time to process and deem the person guilty.I almost agreed with OP until he further explained his \\"plans\\". He has no idea about law, the court proceedings, how the justice system works, how much deportation costs, he doesn't even know the situation in Mexico it seems. People in Mexico dont fear persecution from the goverment itself, but the cartels. US' \\"War on drugs\\" decimated that country and made their situation worse - same as with the Talibans. US could end the immigration and the cartels issues long time ago if they truly wanted to - they dont have a problem with funding other wars - but that is too profitable as well as the cheap labor, to pass on. At least half of the Mexican police is bribed.Migration issues across Europe were also kicked forward due to US and their fight \\"for freedom\\". After 20 years of us complaining of USA being the world police, the goverment plans to abandon its allies as well as the immigrants they forced out of their countries, because it became suddenly inconvenient to their citizens and a good populist promise for people like OP. The events in Palestine will make current situation even worse.A stable goverment even in a poorer country doesn't grant you citizenship or entry in another country. Mexico is at war with the cartels not the goverment and even if they did, why the hell would you ever want to ask a hostile goverment that is after you for an asylum? Where's the fucking logic in that? jfc.Worst of all, he naively believes the system is always just and the goverment will always care for your wellbeing. It doesn't. We already have people sitting in jail for small shit like weed, women have life sentences for defending themselves from their abusive husbands and killing them, or things they didn't even do in the first place. US has more prisoners per capita than China. To any empathetic and intelligent person, it would ring alarm bells in their head.With a hostile goverment in power (which already threatens generals for example), it would be very easy for them to deport political opponents like AOC using denaturalisation as their \\"weapon\\".I dont know what OP even considers an \\"immigrant\\". Who is to decide how far the family line goes to be accepted as \\"true\\" American? This country was build on slaves and immigrants. I wonder if he ever tried to move to another country, leaving everything that one holds dear behind, and knows the horrible reality of it, especially for traumatised folks coming from a war torn or a hopelessly poor country, where one has only scraps to live from.

Agriculture, construction, and would be especially hard-hit. Even worse, the GDP, experts predict, will shrink by $1.1-$1.7 TRILLION dollars.\\n* Trump plans to use the military, the National Guard, and state and local LE to round up the 10-11 million people he plans to deport. This will be exorbitantly expensive, and would leave local LE unable to protect people from real crimes. The military has said it would leave the US unable to protect its interests and citizens.\\n* He plans to put those rounded up (which would inevitably include legal immigrants and citizens) in tent cities near the border. Do you have any idea who long it would take to process 11 million people? Currently, due to the backlog already clogging the immigration courts, it takes YEARS, even DECADES to process deportations. Aside from the grim humanitarian crisis, we'd spend billions, even trillions, guarding, feeding, and providing sanitation and other services.It's an incredibly stupid idea from a man given to wild claims with little or no follow-through.

The problem with undocumented employment in this country is that there are absolutely zero repercussions for corporations that do employ undocumented workers. This is purely due to a Supreme Court decision in the early 2000s (Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Board) that determines that undocumented employees have no protections under the national labor relations act due to them not having citizenship (which if you understand anything about the law is absolutely absurd due to the 14th amendment but you know, yay Supreme Court). This decision effectively gives corporations immunity from consequences of hiring undocumented workers and allows them to violate their civil rights as they see fit. So if you want to disincentivize hiring undocumented workers, go after the protections that conservatives give corporations and give civil rights back to humans by overturning this egregious decision.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"Bidens checked the fuck out","title":"Biden should order background checks of Trumps Cabinet picks"},{"text":"I hear ya.

Their calculation was clearly that aggressive prosecution of sometime so politically popular would be damaging to the US, which is why they handled it slowly and deliberately and pushed it out to a special prosecutor, hoping that Trump's popularity would fade in time, and prosecution of him would be less divisive. Obviously it didn't work since Trump won the last election, but if Trump had lost and was slowly ground into the dust by the wheels of justice over the next few years nobody would be nearly as mad at their course of action. The alternative, a faster and more aggressive prosecution is probably the better call in hindsight because changing up just about anything seems worth trying after you fail, but it's debatable if it would have done any good. Trump's actually got convicted, and that didn't seem to hurt his ability to get reelected. Maybe throwing him in prison would have made the difference, but that's helped many populists throughout history, like Hitler. Throughout his cases and convictions he maintained strong support from judges, politicians, donors, and most importantly voters affiliated with his party, which means Garland really didn't have any good options.","title":"Forget Matt Gaetz.

The problem is people have no concept of how much better things could have been with a competent leader.  Most think the course of Covid was as good as it could have been.  That...is a big fat fallacy.  A good example is Vietnam which handled Covid exceptionally well.  Good leadership would handle everything significantly better, INCLUDING getting in front of it with boots on the ground in December when it first came up.  The US would have normally been heavily involved in world containment with a big push of personnel to help manage critical outbreak areas.  Trump did none of this.  All the resources of this great nation, and he didn't lift a finger.  If this happened during Obama's term, the outbreak would have been significantly different, not just far more rapid and SIGNIFICANT response to outbreak sites but heavy communication and support worldwide.  Equally, there would have been action plans in place to lock down and contain the outbreak and manage the spread...again like Vietnam.  It was possible.  It was manageable, and thousands, not millions would have died.This was the problem with Trump.  He didn't specifically do anything exceptionally bad in the context like Bush going to war in Iraq.  Trump let a million Americans die, but there's no context of what better could have been.  Tariffs were bad, but too many people are too clueless about them to understand they got shafted by one of the biggest tax hikes in recent history.Trump just takes credit for everything, lies about everything, and takes zero blame or responsibility.  He just blames everyone else.That alone would have let Trump survive like this.  No, that took major media support too, 10 years of it, all for the sake of record revenue at the sacrifice of the minds of a hundred million of the American public who will forever believe in a reality that doesn't exist.  They will believe it to their grave, and that's sad.","title":"Dont Give Trump Credit for the Success of the Biden Economy"},{"text":"Well Biden can use that now then for his judges.","title":"MAGA Traitriots are doing their best to get the circus freaks nominated."},{"text":"You're right, that was a mistake.

That's before mentioning how he also has at every opportunity worked to drastically reduce legal immigration, too, despite the rhetoric about focusing on criminals.

I think it's best to set a statute of limitations for the initial crime of everyone the country illegally, and then give most illegal immigrants outside that time frame the opportunity to become naturalized citizens. If they don't want to pursue citizenship and pay taxes (or if they've committed other significant crimes), then they should be deported along with those inside the statute of limitations.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"He didnt deserve to be confirmed to the SCOTUS.","title":"Forget Matt Gaetz.

Trump has already made multiple threats against the media, journalists, the \\"fake news\\" networks, and any individual or organization in particular that has hurt his precious feelings.Laurence W. Britt, who published *\\"Fascism Anyone?\\"*, made a list of 14 defining characteristics of fascism. This list has become widely shared and circulated. See how many parallels you can draw to Trumpism. I'll highlight the relevant portions.- \\"Powerful and continuing expressions of nationalism\\"\\n- \\"Disdain for the importance of human rights\\"\\n- \\"Identification of enemies/scapegoats as a unifying cause\\"\\n- \\"The supremacy of the military/avid militarism\\"\\n- \\"Rampant sexism\\"\\n- \\"A controlled mass media\\"\\n- \\"Obsession with national security\\"\\n- \\"Religion and ruling elite tied together\\"\\n- \\"Power of corporations protected\\"\\n- \\"Power of labor suppressed or eliminated\\"\\n- \\"Disdain and suppression of intellectuals and the arts\\"\\n- \\"Obsession with crime and punishment\\"\\n- \\"Rampant cronyism and corruption\\"\\n- \\"Fraudulent elections\\"I dunno about you, but I found that Trumpism covers almost all the bases here.While Trump cries about Democrats \\"weaponizing the justice system against him,\\" he has the gall to threaten to do the same to all those who have either spoken out against him, those who have challenged or criticized him, who have literally risked their necks to warn the American public about him, those who \\"stole the election\\" from him, and those who have tried to hold him accountable.He is a perpetual victim who cries \\"persecution!\\" whenever there's the remote chance that someone will hold him responsible for his crimes or misconduct. This is a person so delusional and entitled that he likens himself to Nelson Mandela, MLK, Abraham Lincoln, Jesus Christ ffs! A person who has spent his entire life gaming the justice system while desperately avoiding incrimination. Yet, he takes pleasure in knowing that he's just a couple of months away from having the power to go on an all out vengeance spree.There are countless remarks to choose from, many of them unconstitutional, that Trump has made against his opponents, whether on the ticket, in the media, or all around us. Enemies who are constantly scheming to undermine him, rig elections or assassinate him, plotting to weaponize every system of justice against him, to spread \\"fake news,\\" to relentlessly persecute him and his followers.Yes, the term \\"fascism\\" has kind of lost some of its meaning recently, and as a result, Trump supporters will simply roll their eyes whenever they hear the accusation, while simultaneously being on board with many of the... qualities mentioned above.One thing they'll argue is, \\"how come Trump wasn't a fascist during his first term huh!? Checkmate libs!\\"But he tried, and your memory-holing of his presidency, of his efforts to overturn the election, his promotion of election denying misinformation, of his incendiary and xenophobic rhetoric, of his autocratic whims, his many attempts to obstruct justice, his unconstitutional threats, his appeal to white supremacist groups, his incitement of violence against marginalized people, and his overtly bigoted, ultra nationalistic, nativist, highly divisive, insular and intolerant fascist language doesn't change that.Not only that, but during Trump's last presidency, he had people around him, people who acted as guardrails against his worst impulses and instincts, and this time around, Trump has and will surround himself with loyalists who won't act as checks against his authoritarian and fascist whims, instead, they'll be there to enable him, embolden him, use him.While at the same time, according to some of Trump's sycophants, we are not supposed to take this stuff seriously, Trump just \\"exaggerates\\" sometimes, admitting of course, that Donald Trump isn't a serious candidate.Trump's absurdity magically renders him benign? Is that what you're saying? We're just supposed to look the other way, and not take him at his word?

Now you have a person who has no connection to the country they were born in, does not have any family there, and doesnt speak the language. They are essentially Americans without the citizenship. Now imagine making a mistake and being exiled to Korea? No money, you dont speak the language, you dont know anybody, and you leave all your family behind in America. This is a thing that happens.Heres a wiki page about it:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_Korean_adoptees_from_the_United_StatesIf you scroll down to example deportations theres some pretty heartbreaking stories. Heres one:Phillip Clay (Kim Sang-pil) was found abandoned in Seoul in 1981 and legally adopted into an American family in?Philadelphia.\\nAfter a struggle with?drug addiction?and a run in with the law, Clay was deported back to Korea in 2012, despite no knowledge of the?Korean language?or customs, nor without a single contact in the country. In 2017, Clay ended his life jumping from the 14th floor of a building in?Seoul.[7][2]\\nAnother famous example is Adam Crapser, he was adopted from Korea as a baby in the 70s, he had the misfortune of ending up with 2 extremely abusive families, both were actually charged with child abuse and after he was removed from the second family he wound up in foster care. He had a rough start in life and was arrested a few times in his youth for domestic violence. He decided he didnt want to be an angry person anymore and turned his life around, became a barber, got married, and started a family. Years down the line when trying to find his adoption documentation he learned that he was not a US citizen and applied for his green card, this turned out to be a huge mistake as it alerted the system that he was not a citizen and had been arrested so he was looking at automatic deportation.

He can't afford a lawyer and is stuck with a public defended and is convicted of simple assault.

Under your rule he gets deported.Or at night tries to find a bush to take a piss and thinks he's alone but someone records him and he is picked up for indecent exposure. Under your rule he gets deported. And keep in mind in all these cases that Jon is already fighting an uphill battle because he doesn't have the same access to resources that a citizen or resident has. He may not even have done the crime at all but the right (or I guess wrong) prosecutor, judge, or investigators mean he gets deported to a place he doesn't recognize, where he doesn't speak the language, and where he has no known family.This isn't unrealistic either - Jon is based on a friend of mine from college who went on to join the Navy.

Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws, and I believe that they must be held accountable, but lets be honest  tracking down, rounding up, and deporting millions of people isnt realistic. Anyone who suggests otherwise isnt being straight with you. Thats why were going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security. Felons, not families. Criminals, not children. Gang members, not a mother whos working hard to provide for her kids. - Barack Obama in 2014. Obamas administration had deported about 2.9 million from 2009-2015. Trumps administration deported about 1.5 million from 2017-2021. Bidens Administration has allegedly deported roughly the same figures as the Trump Administration. So over the last four administrations, 16 years, there have been around 5.9+ million deported with Obama being responsible for the most. Thats less than 1.5 million undocumented/illegal immigrants deported per administration. Since 2017 there have only been 95 cases sent to the DOJ for prosecution and denaturalization. There are millions of first-generation Americans. People need to stop fear mongering and understand that the government does have an idea of who they are going after. It is asinine to believe theyll just round up anyone. Since 2017 theyve reviewed thousands of cases and only 95 have been prosecuted and denaturalized. Basically less than 1% of the demographic is going to be investigated throughout the next administration. Very few people will be affected. There are millions of first and second generation Americans in this country that can vote and are law abiding citizens. They have nothing to worry about. Its racist to think they will just target anyone they deem an immigrant. If you think that Hispanic-Americans or Arab-Americans need to live in fear out of the risk of deportation/denaturalization then you are part of the racist problem. Is it not okay for Trump to deport people who dont belong here? Is it not what Obama did?

There are about 44 million first-generation Americans in the United States.There are about 33 million second-generation Americans in the United States. Thats about 89+ million people in the United States that are being told to live in fear. Thats about 77+ million Americans that are being told to fear that they might be denaturalized and deported. Since 2017, there have been 95 cases sent to the DOJ for prosecution and denaturalization. Less than 100 individuals who deliberately changed their identities to be granted immigration benefits had those benefits revoked. In other words, out of thousands of cases that were reviewed, only 95 cases were deemed to have sufficient evidence that an individual lied to obtain something they may not have earned if they were honest from the beginning. We finally have a process in place to get to the bottom of all these bad cases and start denaturalizing people who should not have been naturalized in the first place, USCIS Director L. Francis Cissna. Very few people have actually gone through denaturalization since Trump was president. The idea that they will just go after anyone they see as an immigrant is insulting to those Americans who truly believe that Trump is not referring to them. To assume that our government doesnt have an idea of who they want to target as well is asinine. To assume that we, as Latino-Americans, should all fear possible deportation is racist. There are 65 million Americans who identify as Hispanic/Latino according to the 2020 U.S. Census, and were supposed to believe that any of us, hardworking, tax paying, law abiding citizens are going to be stripped and deported? Thats silly and if you think we should all live in fear of deportation than you are racist for not seeing us as more than Latino or First and Second-Generation Americans that are waiting to be deported for an I told you so. The Reddit bubble that was sure Harris would win is now sure that leopards will feast. Stop fear mongering. Youre not helping anyone. If you want to be an ally for undocumented/illegal immigrants then advocate for a plan. Let it be known that we want the immigrants here and that there should be an easier way for them to get documents so that they can get decent jobs and not be exploited for cheap labor. If you advocate for illegal immigration you need to advocate for a plan so that the undocumented can be documented and accepted quicker than it already is, so they have access to decent jobs with benefits instead of waiting around for an opportunity. Advocate for housing so that the then documented immigrants have places to live and communities to grow. Undocumented workers are cheap labor that cant fight for fair rights or defend themselves against the law to the opportunistic. Fight for their rights. I STG sometimes it feels like the Democratic Party uses illegal/undocumented immigrants the same way that the GOP uses unborn babies. And FYI, Obama has deported more illegal/undocumented workers than any other president in history. Amnesty is the immigration system we have today  millions of people who live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules, while politicians use the issue to scare people and whip up votes at election time. Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws, and I believe that they must be held accountable, but lets be honest  tracking down, rounding up, and deporting millions of people isnt realistic. Anyone who suggests otherwise isnt being straight with you. Thats why were going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security. Felons, not families. Criminals, not children. Gang members, not a mother whos working hard to provide for her kids. - Barack Obama in 2014.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"more please","title":"Those are feds"},{"text":"Literally one would hope.","title":"Trump is going to get sick of Elon soon."},{"text":"This is these people's screwed up idea of being \\"unbiased\\", just yelling \\"Let's all agree to stop fighting\\", and not at all factoring that it's literally an invasion.Imagine Canada siezing several northern states, and everyone on the right screaming, \\"just let it go, man!

In that sense, it should be legally wrong, in many cases, to move to a different country without permission.But in the case you describe, it feels difficult to argue that it's always immoral to illegally immigrate to a country.For one thing, when you say that a country \\"doesn't want you\\", this is complicated by the fact that many countries actually benefit, on the whole, from at least some immigrants who arrived illegally.Right now, for example, the US has a 4% unemployment rate. It's generally accepted by experts that 3 to 5 percent is a healthy unemployment rate; you can't get lower than that, as \\"frictional unemployment\\" is mostly unavoidable (sometimes people get fired, quit their jobs without having a new one lined up, etc. - that's just natural).Meanwhile, it's estimated that there are 8 million US workers who immigrated here illegally. Many of them are working at jobs that citizens would prefer to avoid.Doing the math suggests that these workers are actually benefiting the US as a whole. They aren't getting Social Security or other benefits, they're not taking high-paying jobs, they're contributing to the economy. So, it's not really the case that the country doesn't want them - it's more that the legal system doesn't want them, while employers *do* want them.Really, this just shows that our immigration system is broken. It's messed up that our country benefits from these immigrants, but we make it illegal for them to come here; presumably, we'd be better off letting in more people legally and then limiting illegal immigration more.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"Reusing legislation designed to evict terrorists, and going after 'suspected fraud' in law abiding citizens, even at face value seems pretty fucking weak.","title":"What is Trump really about to do to this country??"},{"text":"Well never know for sure, but not just here but there have been other articles talking about how people who were on the fence were persuaded into voting for Trump based on the Joe Rogan podcast and I imagine the other podcasts in that vein had similar effects","title":"CNN Talks to Trump Supporters at the UFC"},{"text":"I really hope so.

Something doesn't have to be mentioned in the constitution to be protected. The reality is that we need (needed) to take back the Supreme Court, and then the Dobbs decision could've been overturned and abortion rights restored nationwide. That's all that matters.

My understanding of Roe vs. Wade is defense used argument that right to privacy is a right implicit (not explicit) in the U.S. Constitution - I agree with this intrepretation (especially cuz of 4th Amendment) but I still think it's a pretty weak argument for right to abortion being a federal issue. Who cares? Women are bleeding out in parking lots. If a liberal Supreme Court forcibly interprets the Constitution as protecting reproductive rights, that is objectively a good thing.Also, the Supreme Court would 100% approve of the Comstock Act being used to restrict abortion nationwide.

An implicit premise is that the US justice system is inherently fair and just, only delivering jail time to people who really deserve it. You might believe this, but I would say among Americans its a controversial statement  certainly not something everyone believes. Anecdotally, I have discussed this topic personally with multiple prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges and not a single one of them holds this view. They vary on how fair they think the system is but they all acknowledge that we do, in fact, lock up innocent people and charge people overzealously to give them jail time when its not really justified.2. Even when they deserve it, deporting these criminals might not always be in the US interest. Suppose for example we have drug cartel members from Mexico in a federal prison. When we deport them to Mexico, are they more or less likely than before to do harm to the US? I would guess more. We have to decide if its better to pay for their imprisonment here, or risk their return to crime that negatively affects our interests (such as drug smuggling and production).3. Theres an assumption that the downstream consequences will be worth it. Lets grant your argument that theres no deontological reason why deporting these folks is morally wrong, there could still be something wrong with the plan if a large number of people are deported and it has some negative effect. A lot of formerly incarcerated people have jobs, and if they suddenly disappeared it could destabilize certain areas of the economy. I dont really know how many people fit into category 2, nor can I say with extreme confidence what the downstream consequences of such a plan (only deporting the people you describe) would be, but I do think these are unexamined issues with your view as stated that at least complicate the matter.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"I just know every time a private company needed to run a background check on me I had to sign off on it.Any slimy Republican is free to squirm out of a routine check by not taking the job.

It's why the transgender ads were so effective.Transgender people are far more likely to be victims of bathroom sexual assaults than they are to be the perpetrators, by orders of magnitude. If you force transgender women to use the men's bathroom, you will be causing more sexual assaults than you prevent.I don't think there's been enough case study to say this besides personal belief. What I do know is there has been plenty of sexual assaults by transgender in women's bathroom. A popular case that got national attenion is.  \\n[Virginia family sues school system for $30 million over students sexual assault in bathroom](https://apnews.com/article/loudoun-virginia-lawsuit-transgender-bathroom-sexual-assault-a26168568cc20c2aa6cec9bef50e7c3f)Do you think \\"oh, the rules say you aren't supposed to be in this bathroom\\" is going to stop a bathroom rapist?No but allowing it legally in a private space makes it much easier to do the act.As a woman who has also been raped, it seems that Nancy Mace has wrongly conflated her rapist with Transgenders.

I'm convinced that so much of the problems with breaking through to people is that our media has convinced them that their feelings matter more than objective reality. Ignore plenty of positive objective economic indicators - people still feel the squeeze (even though we know partisans' view of the economy is going to improve by 30 points on January 20th for no particular reason.) Kamala didn't make a bit deal about being a woman or biracial, but doesn't it *feel* like she did? Hell, even left-leaning people aren't immune to it. It takes like 20 seconds for some rando to remind you that Flint doesn't have clean water, even though it has had clean water for literal years at this point. Good intentions don't cover falsehoods that do nothing but sow distrust in institutions. Not really the point of your post but that's become a huge pet peeve of mine. Anyway, answers: 1. I've had this with a coworker who I do tabletop gaming with, and my brother. They can usually point to some random obnoxious person on Twitter or Vanity Fair or something doing a performative \\"men, amiright?\\" bit, but nothing really beyond that. And in fairness to them, I also find it pretty cringe-worthy. But then I'll see them repost something like Harrison Butker's speech talking shit on women with jobs. It's very hard to see it as anything but insecurity that other people are happy with other lifestyles. Most people don't actually care that you want to be/have a tradwife, you trying to crowbar your lifestyle on other people is what people lash out at you for. \\n2. I don't have the patience for it. Again, we have a society that coddles peoples' narcissistic perceptions of what we as Democrats do or don't do. If people are going to insist that we're abandoning them due to support trans rights or women's rights, they're not going to change their mind if we try to walk it back, they'll just find some other grievance.\\n3. I don't want to belabor it too much, but as a straight man who's fallen on very hard times in the past and didn't go down these paths, I'm very much not interested in trying to understand manosphere dudes right now. Not proud of it, but I know I'm not in the mood to and probably won't be for a while. That said, one thing I've always found effective it to weaponize that persecution complex. You think JK Rowling is on your side fighting the woke agenda? Think again, her hatred of trans people is tied to her hatred of men. These people don't like men, don't respect men, have a low view of men, and want to exploit you for their personal gain. If you're on their side, you're a weak-willed follower. (Again, I'm probably not the best guy for this lol. I doubt I'll win anyone over, but I think it does take the wind out of some men's sails and makes the whole masculine facade feel faker.)\\n4. I do think there's some genuine improvements to be made in messaging. \\"Identity politics\\" is kind of a shibboleth to let people know you're against wokeness or whatever, but I think there is maybe one legit criticism to be made in there. I do think we assume to much about what specific identity groups want or even identify with themselves. I've met too many black college conservatives or working-class lesbians (who identify more with the former than the latter) to assume I know who literally anyone is going to vote for. This probably sounds passe, but I do think speaking to universal issues of opportunity, while still making it clear that Democrats want to enable everyone to live the specific life and expression they see for themselves is a much more winning message.

Tariff duties paid will increase the price of imported goods [duh]. Consumers, off-put by higher prices, make fewer purchases as a result (less consumer demand). As purchases reduce, inventory of unsold imported product begins to build up (less scarcity). Business wanting to push product (whose value is declining by the day), will respond by reducing their asking price, desperately trying to sell for as much as they can.. while they can. Two. The prices of groceries are high not just because of corporate greediness boogeyman.. but because if say you are unwilling to pay said asking price.. then there is some other consumer who happily will. There is absolutely zero need any vendor to reduce prices IF demand for their product remains strong. As in the example in my previous paragraph, the need to reduce prices [at all] is reliant on consumer demand **as well as** amount of available product inventory it even has for sale. Huge unsold stockpile, due to low demand, results in lower &amp; lower prices. And vice versa. A shortage of inventory, due to high demand, results in higher &amp; higher prices. The current market price of ANY product and or service for sale considers **two factors**. A numerical range spanning a vendors highest list price, down to the lowest amount hes willing to accept. Another numerical range spanning a buyers lowest offer price, up to the highest amount hes willing to pay. Somewhere where these two numerical ranges overlap, a deal could be made. The amount both parties agree to becomes the sales price. The average price of many purchase transactions of same product becomes the market price. Supply and demand.","title":"CMV: You cant be an intelligent person and vote GOP"},{"text":"Define crimeThis isnt meant to be a trick coming to the US without going through legal channels IS a crime by definition.

If I gain my happiness from suffering, then is it moral for me to suffer?  Or if I gain my happiness from means that cause other people to suffer then are those means of happiness moral? What if the majority of people experience happiness from methods that cause a minority to experience suffering? Are those methods moral? I could go on with these types of questions. Additionally, what is the definition of suffering and happiness? Happiness doesn't really have a fixed, non-relative definition. The way we view happiness isn't the same as it has been viewed throughout history, even if we're only looking at it from a [eurocentric point of view. ](https://www.amacad.org/publication/daedalus/history-happiness-400-bc-ad-1780) So there is already an issue here with your definition of morality, which is for it to work we first have to come to an agreement on what suffering and happiness are. Then we have to ask what happens if one person's happiness clashes with another person causing the latter suffering? Or how do you balance the fact that there will inevitably be some so suffer at the expense of another being happy (think about someone suffering from a broken heart while their former lover is with a new partner). Lastly, not all cultures and philosophical outlooks view suffering (at least some) as inherently bad. Some view it as a good thing, a necessity to build a virtuous character. Some philosophical outlooks will see that too much happiness is bad and can lead one to be too prideful, and that for a healthy person they need some suffering and some happiness.","title":"CMV: Saudi Arabia exemplifies a society where cultural defenses serve as pretexts for systematic oppression"},{"text":"I don't believe Biden has any morals either.","title":"Do you guys remember how often posts like this would pop up on Reddit?

Go back to campus and try a social science class to see what I mean... How equally represented and respected are conservative perspectives? The typical response is \\"But the professionals agree...\\", but isn't this argument also the very hive mind you decry? Do these professionals tolerate and champion dissension within their ranks or is it squashed out? Go ahead, be honest. I know the answer.Unfortunately, you are coming at these from a liberal perspective of what conservatives represent (creating a caricature) and are not asking conservatives their perspectives directly. For example:* Conservatives don't support tariffs because they will bring down prices, they support them because they see jobs being shipped overseas where there are lower wages. That removes the jobs from this country.\\n* Grocery prices are high for a number of reasons, and conservatives don't think \\"the economy\\" was the only factor. However, I **hate** when liberals flip out over corporate greed... That is what a morally relativistic society creates. Any sane person could see the corporations salivating during the COVID chaos created by a shutdown conservatives saw as unnecessary, pointless, and Democrat led. Did it occur under Trump? Yes, but [governors ordered the shutdowns](https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html). Trump issued travel bans. Conservatives would argue that if you are vulnerable, stay home and isolate... Don't make the rest of the country do it. Then, a **bunch** of money was dumped into the economy under Biden, driving inflation through the roof. Why? Nobody I know saw a penny of benefit. Any Econ grad worth their salt could tell you that flooding the economy with money would drive up inflation. Are they not intelligent?\\n* I have never heard a single conservative make this argument. They are largely upset that the prices were cheaper under Trump and higher under Biden, but so is anybody putting gas in their tank. Also, conservatives are unhappy because the green technology agenda of the democrat party made it appear to them that the democrats didn't really care about the issue in the first place. Please point me to the speech where the democrats pledge to make fossil fuels cheaper and more readily accessible again.\\n* I think you forgot \\"stubbing my toe\\" in your list. Seriously though, ever notice how Putin moved on Ukraine twice under democrat leadership or Hamas attacked Israel under democrat leadership? To conservatives, this indicates that other countries don't fear or respect democrat leadership of our nation. Republicans may have the reputation of \\"hawks\\" or in Trump's case be unpredictable, but that helps keep things in line. If you can't predict your opponent, you play it safe. Many people like to blame the USA: \\"Yeah, but the USA initiated...\\" Quite frankly, conservatives don't care because they believe the USA has the right to look out for its own best interests, and being a superpower means the USA has dibs.\\n* This last point is kind of a catch-all for you. So I'll point out a few myself: Conservatives believe all illegal immigrants have committed a crime (entering illegally), women's bodily privacy should be protected, biology respected, natural consequences should result for gambling with carnal activity, human beings respected and valued at all life stages, death penalty as the ultimate price for taking the ultimate value, etc.All of these things can be supported by someone who is intelligent. My guess is this is someone venting over their November loss.

Conversely, if one argues abortion should be treated legally as homicide or even murder (I don't) - murder is a state crime.

The Insurrection Act\\"When can the president invoke the Insurrection Act?\\nTroops can be deployed under three sections of the Insurrection Act. Each of these sections is designed for a different set of situations. Unfortunately, the laws requirements are poorly explained and leave virtually everything up to the discretion of the president.\\nSection 251 allows the president to deploy troops if a states legislature (or governor if the legislature is unavailable) requests federal aid to suppress an insurrection in that state. This provision is the oldest part of the law, and the one that has most often been invoked.\\nWhile Section 251 requires state consent, Sections 252 and 253 allow the president to deploy troops without a request from the affected state, even against the states wishes. Section 252 permits deployment in order to enforce the laws of the United States or to suppress rebellion whenever unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion make it impracticable to enforce federal law in that state by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings.\\nSection 253 has two parts. The first allows the president to use the military in a state to suppress any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy that so hinders the execution of the laws that any portion of the states inhabitants are deprived of a constitutional right and state authorities are unable or unwilling to protect that right. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy relied on this provision to deploy troops to desegregate schools in the South after the Supreme Courts landmark decision in?Brown v. Board of Education.\\nThe second part of Section 253 permits the president to deploy troops to suppress any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy in a state that opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws. This provision is so bafflingly broad that it cannot possibly mean what it says, or else it authorizes the president to use the military against any two people conspiring to break federal law.\\"\\nhttps://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/insurrection-act-explained https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/insurrection-act-explained","title":"Trump Confirms He Plans to Use Military for Mass Deportations"},{"text":"She was a major contributor to post-fact politics","title":"Mother of MAGA Sarah Palin Fumes at Trump Cabinet Snub"},{"text":"These headlines are just making him more desirable to the GOP.","title":"Attorney Says Matt Gaetz Paid 2 Women For Sex"},{"text":"They may not all be idiots but they are all complicit.

The longer the Justice Department stalled before investigating the former president, the more the GOP and the media embraced Trump as the Republican front-runner for 2024.Second, by slow-walking the case, Garland undermined all of us who said that Trump had attempted to overturn a free and fair election in 2020, and was a clear and present threat to our democracy. The absence of charges sent a message to America that what Trump did could be that serious.Because of Garlands foot-dragging,?[it took Smith until August 2023 to gather evidence and build the case against Trump](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2023-08-01/donald-trump-indicted-in-connection-with-efforts-to-overturn-2020-election)?for seeking to overturn the 2020 election. By then, we were in the heat of the 2024 presidential race and Trump was far and away the front-runner in the polls. This gave Trump plenty of ammunition to say the entire prosecution was an effort by Biden to hurt his likely 2024 opponent. The?[first?GOP primary debate](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2023-08-24/gop-debate-marked-by-infighting-as-candidates-get-personal-in-opening-round)?was held before the charges were filed, and even Trumps Republican opponents slammed Biden for weaponizing the DOJ against Trump. The timing made the whole endeavor backfire.  \\nIn January 2022,?[I warned](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/garland-needs-bring-jan-6-criminal-charges-against-donald-trump-n1287039)?that if Garland didnt move swiftly to hold Trump accountable, historians will count it among the key mistakes that ultimately led to the end of the United States as a democratic republic.And here we are: Our republic hangs in the balance because of Garlands abject failure in holding Trump accountable. Even worse, after?[Smith resigns](https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-11-13/jack-smith-plans-to-step-down-as-special-counsel-before-trump-takes-office-nyt-reports), he has every reason to fear retribution from the incoming Trump administration. He may have to go into hiding with his family for trying to defend our republic by prosecuting Trump for his crimes.Yet the man who failed our nation C Merrick Garland C will not face those threats or concerns. Instead, Garland can write books, hobnob with his friends at the?[Federalist Society](https://fedsoc.org/contributors/merrick-garland), where hes a member, and rake in big bucks as a partner at a big Washington, D.C., area law firm. We dont know if the disgraced Congressman Gaetz will get confirmed as Trumps attorney general, but we already know that Garland failed our nation.[*Dean Obeidallah*](https://deanobeidallah.substack.com/)*, a former trial attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radios daily program The Dean Obeidallah Show.*","title":"Forget Matt Gaetz.

Wtf am I missing something? *The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA) is a U.S. federal law that governs how temporary appointments are made to fill vacant executive agency positions that require Senate confirmation (known as \\"advice and consent\\" positions). Heres an overview of its key provisions and purpose:**Key Provisions of the FVRA:**1. Acting Officials: The FVRA establishes rules for appointing \\"acting\\" officials to temporarily fill positions when the primary officeholder resigns, dies, or is otherwise unable to serve.*\\n*2. Eligible Appointees: It specifies who can serve in an acting capacity:**A person who was the \\"first assistant\\" to the office.**A senior official in the agency who has been in the agency for at least 90 days in a position at or above the GS-15 level (part of the federal civil service pay scale).**A person appointed by the President to another Senate-confirmed position.**3. Time Limits: The FVRA limits the time that someone can serve in an acting role. Generally, it is 210 days from the vacancys start, with extensions if the President submits a nomination for the position to the Senate. This time period may be extended if the vacancy occurs around a presidential transition.*\\n*4. Presidential Nomination: Once the President nominates someone for a vacant position, the acting official can generally continue to serve until the Senate confirms or rejects the nominee. If the nomination is withdrawn or rejected, the acting officer can serve for an additional 210 days while a new nomination is made.**Purpose of the FVRA:**The FVRA was enacted to standardize and limit the Presidents ability to bypass the Senates \\"advice and consent\\" role. Before the FVRA, there were fewer restrictions, leading to concerns that Presidents could install temporary officials indefinitely or avoid the Senate confirmation process.**The FVRA seeks to balance flexibility in staffing essential government functions with accountability to Congress, ensuring that key roles in the executive branch are filled by officials who have undergone Senate scrutiny.*","title":"MAGA Traitriots are doing their best to get the circus freaks nominated."},{"text":"I just finished ep 6 last night.

ACB voted with the liberals to protect voting rights in Arizona and in Trump v United States wrote a concurring opinion that did agree that a President cannot be prosecuted for crimes that were part of official acts.But \\"stepped out of line\\" when in that opinion she also stated that his official acts as President could be used as evidence of crimes he committed in his non Presidential duties.  And do you remember the more recent Trump v Anderson? The case where the Colorado Supreme Court ruled Trump was ineligible for office and couldn't appear on the ballot? All 9 justices were in full agreement that the Colorado Supreme Court had zero authority to do that.

Hutchinson testified under oath that Trump was personally involved in organizing the Jan. 6 rally and inciting the crowd C which he knew was armed C against the advice of the presidents own lawyers.Garlands office instead prosecuted members of the mob that attacked the Capitol, on the theory that they were working their way up from low-level actors to higher officials.

In contrast to Trump's economy that left half the country broke and unemployed, we are now at stabilized inflation and outperforming every other developed economy in the world.* Unemployment under Trump stood at 6.7% the month before Biden took office. It's now at 4.1%.\\n* The DOW was around 30-31k around the time Biden won and got inaugurated. It's now at 43,400.\\n* Similarly, the S&amp;P 500 was at around 3,700 when Trump left. It is now at 5,900.\\n* Inflation-adjusted GDP under Trump averaged 2.67% before COVID and 1.4% after. Biden's average stands at something like 3.5%.\\n* The national debt rose 39% under Trump, skyrocketing long before COVID due to his costly corporate tax cuts. It rose 25% under Biden, who had to spend a fortune to get us out of Trump's inflicted COVID mess.\\n* Median wages are higher than before the pandemic, even after adjusting for inflation. The typical U.S. worker out-earned inflation by $1,400 a year, according by a recent report.So explain to me how Trump was good for the economy, again? Trump inherited a stable economy and still failed to keep any of his growth promises before running up the debt and destroying it all during COVID. Biden inherited a devastating post-pandemic recession and massive inflation, and we're now in a better position than under Trump.

However, it's fair to say that this unemployment was due at least in part to Trump's mishandling of the pandemic.The current unemployment rate sits at 4.1%, which is a marked improvement from the COVID times. Under Biden, the unemployment rate has hovered between 3.7% and 4.1% since 2022, which is fairly stable.While it's not record-breaking, these numbers are quite reasonable.

Many nations who have experienced an exodus are not in a situation, both economically or socially, to accept deportees who have left for those very reasons. Furthermore, nations of origin will likely object to the treatment of their citizens by the government, as will the electorate, with many of them relying on remittance from the US to support low income family members.Mexico can easily close air, land and seaports to US migrant trafficking, which is essentially what is proposed. Other nations can just as easily refuse and this leaves migrants permanently detained which is both inhumane and at great cost to the US. The labour market economics of this policy also results in a great cost to productivity and is inflationary.Many industries in the US, agriculture particularly, have depended on exploitation of low paid migrants undertaking work which is labour intensive and unattractive to most Americans. Uncertain migration status has been used by unscrupulous employers to pay low wages.

As for Tulsi, she singlehandedly took Kamala Harris out of the race in a 2019 primary debate. But then she received no support from the DNC in her presidential bid. She was in the National Guard and served as a Congresswoman for 8 years. She eventually left the Democrats and was dragged through the mud in the media, simply for opposing policies she disagreed with. Lastly, if you look at what was in the border bill, it was loaded with expansive provisions that made it a poison pill that the Democrats tried to ram through:* new pathway to citizenship for illegals (which Republicans argued would further incentivize illegal crossings)\\n* allowing surge crossings of up to 5,000 daily encounters before enacting stricter border measures\\n* added 250,000 visas over 5 years and protections for documented dreamers \\n* the bill maintained parole programs used to admit hundreds of thousands of Haitians, Cubans, Nicaraguans, and others that they were using to sidestep standard immigration processes.\\n* permanent legal status for Afghans\\n* increased funding for border infrastructure \\n \\nThats all I can remember off the top of my head. Some were bi-partisan, but most of the bill was expansive of Democrats immigration agenda, and it did very little to actually fix the problem of the massive surges in illegal crossings. Of course, when the bill failed to pass, Republicans were blamed for not wanting to fix the problem. Trump knew that an expansive bill was not necessary, as Biden had rolled back effective policies of Trump, such as Remain in Mexico. All he needed to do was put them back in place, and the problem wouldve been solved.

Theres a lot that people dont understand about the role of immigrants in the U.S. economy. It is something like maybe 8 million undocumented workers in the United States, something like 5 percent of the workforce. You say, OK, that would be pretty bad if we lose that, but how bad could it be? And the answer is that they are not evenly distributed. There are certain occupations that are really very heavily immigrant, certain jobs that are very heavily filled by immigrants, many of them undocumented. Those include in particular ... top of the list would be food. Agricultural workers, about three quarters are immigrants and probably about half of them are undocumented. Meat packing is probably between 30 and 50 percent undocumented immigrants. So the whole food supply chain is reliant on people who are going to be rounded up and put in camps. Sargent: That seems like a problem when you describe it that way. Ive got to think that Trump voters in particular could very well feel these impacts very acutely. Theyre getting scammed here, arent they? Whats the impact going to be on so-called Trump country?Krugman: Grocery prices are a real flash point. Affluent Americans spend a relatively small share of their budget on food, but less affluent spend a lot on food. Most people have no ideahow does that stuff get to your table? Whats the process by which food gets grown and processed and sent to supermarkets? People have very low information about all of this and they have no idea that what sounds like a good thing, Lets get rid of these illegal immigrants and give the jobs to Americanswell, it aint going to work that way or isnt going to work smoothly. And its going to be a pretty big shock to peoples cost of living and the way they live.[U.S. voters say immigrants mostly take jobs others dont want, according to Pew Research](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2024/11/18/u-s-voters-say-immigrants-mostly-take-jobs-others-dont-want/76331228007)When looking at occupations C the kind of work that people do on the job C immigrants overall accounted for the largest share of workers in farming, fishing and forestry (43%) in 2022, followed by construction and extraction (29%), according to a Pew analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data.Immigrants outnumbered U.S.-born workers in some jobs, such as manicurists/pedicurists (73%), taxi drivers (57%), and drywall/ceiling installers (53%), the analysis found.Unauthorized immigrant workers accounted for the largest shares in occupations such as drywall/ceiling tile installers and tapers (33%), roofers (32%), painters and paperhangers (28%), other agricultural workers (24%), construction laborers (24%), and maids and housekeeping cleaners (24%).Legal immigrant workers accounted for the largest shares in jobs such as manicurists/pedicurists (60%), taxi drivers (44%), interpreters and translators (38%), other life scientists (35%), and physical scientists (34%).","title":"Undocumented migrants hope Trump mass deportations only 'for criminals'"},{"text":"Kind of off topic, but is there a way for me to see the comments on X without having to sign up?
