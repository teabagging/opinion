I have a couple people I've known most of my life, liberals, who were not pleased with that situation and scoffed at her political fakiness. They ended up being correct that she was unelectable. Her 2020 polls had her as being really unpopular, and as I listened to her speak more (having generally ignored her as VP) I kinda saw what they saw.Also, you absolutely cannot discount the inflation that resulted in most countries in the entire world voting against incumbents the past 3 years.Right wing radio and podcasters and influencers are absolutely strong but many get increasingly polarized which tends to shrink their audience.

I don't necessarily see it as a net positive or negative just yet, but there are two things that I can see which look promising thus far.The first being that families are being reunited in Syria as people are making plans to return or have already, and others are being recovered from prisons and dungeons all over. I know this is a short-term positive, but I know there are a lot of people out there who are taking it for what it is for now. The second is that this group who are described as being an offshoot of the Islamic State have, according to reports I've encountered thus far, helped protect a village with a mostly christian following. Furthermore, there are no indications that they're giving these people any trouble for not being muslim. Now, I'm not a christian myself and don't necessarily care for religions for the most part, but given what we know about Islamic State, these actions seem to run counter to Daesh's goals and ideals. For what it's worth, I look at this as a cautiously optimistic course of action, and would like to see how this acceptance will fare across the rest of the country. However, I am aware that not everything is sunshine and rainbows. I watched an uncensored video where they had a bunch of unarmed Russian POWs and gunned them all down, no survivors. I do oppose the Russian military and its actions as of the past almost two decades, but this shows a DGAF attitude about international norms, such as the Geneva Conventions, for example. (Yeah, I am calling that a war crime outright.)That said, this is all I have for now.

Chinas economy is struggling with stagnation, hence why they are flooding the world market with their cheap exports trying to suck up as much capital as possible. Want to hurt China? Step on their throat by slapping them with high tariffs to make their exports prohibitively expensive. 25% tariff wont cut it. Im talking 100-200% tariff if you really want to hurt them. Want Mexico to wrangle the cartels? Hit them with tariffs with the condition that they will get higher and higher every year that illicit drugs are smuggled across the border. Hate Canadians? Tariffs. No other explanation needed. The point is, tariffs can be utilized as valuable diplomatic tools.

They are substantial. The latter\\ncarries an imputation of guilt; acceptance a confession of it.\\nThe former has no such imputation or confession. It is\\ntantamount to the silence of the witness. It is noncommittal.There is no ambiguity here: \\"[A pardon] carries an imputation of guilt; acceptance a confession of it.\\"Let us consider the Appellate Court's reasoning: The way the district court read that language was to mean that an acceptance of a pardon is a literal confession of guilt, with all corresponding legal consequences. But a far more plausible reading is to read Burdick to mean that acceptance of a pardon only makes the pardonee look guilty by implying or imputing that he needs the pardon. This reading, focusing on public opinion of the pardonee, lines up with the Courts references to sensitiveness, personal disgrace, opprobrium, and infamy, and its distinction between personal consequences and penal ones.This interpretation is folly at best. The original statement by the Court allows for no such nuance. As such, this rationale of the Appellate Court does not match reality. Instead, the Appellate Court injects into the statement and context of the Supreme Court's assertion \\"[a pardon] carries an imputation of guilt; acceptance a confession of it\\" reasoning the Court itself saw zero reason to include.However, let's set this bit aside for the moment and note even the Appellate Court agrees: Although no one disputes that Burdicks statement that a pardon carries an\\nimputation of guilt; acceptance a confession of it, was dictum, **that does not alone\\nrender it unreliable**. 236 U.S. at 94. See Gaylor v. United States, 74 F.3d 214, 217\\n(10th Cir. 1996) ([T]his court considers itself bound by Supreme Court dicta almost\\nas firmly as by the Courts outright holdings . . . .).[Emphasis added]Instead, the Appellate Court goes on to say \\"Instead, the problem with the district courts reliance on Burdick is that the district court appears to have taken the Courts statement out of context, giving it legal effect that ignores the context of that statement.\\" This statement by the Appellate Court is at odds with its own aforementioned misuse of context. As such, to put simply, the Appellate Court did not conclude \\"dicta is not binding\\" and also used faulty reasoning to arrive at its conclusions anyway.Now, I'm going to take a wild guess and say you were not one of the three judges on the Appellate Court who were a party to this opinion; so, please understand I do not mean anything I wrote hear as a criticism of you. It does mean, however, to whatever extent the Appellate Court's ruling tries to support the assertion \\"dicta is not binding\\", it fails to do so.","title":"'We are proud of what we did': Jan. 6 committee member Schiff slams Trump's remarks"},{"text":"He was a Senator","title":"Failed GOP candidate and failed Senate candidate Kari Lake a top contender to become Trump's ambassador to Mexico"},{"text":"trump on how he's going to save healthcare Trump, when asked if Americans will see his fully developed plan, said he doesnt know if people will see it at all.trump on how he's going to save americans money President-elect Donald Trump said he cant guarantee anything when asked whether his proposed tariffs would increase prices for American familiesthis is how he gets his moron followers. he both simultaneously promises people everything and nothing.","title":"'Still Just Concepts?': NBC's Kristen Welker Presses Trump For Details On Health Care Plan"},{"text":"Oh, look, another liberal partisan hack purposefully ignoring the stark difference between \\"illegal aliens\\" and \\"lawful immigrants\\" for woke outrage points.It must be monday again.","title":"MSNBCs Wallace: Trump Voters Dont Care About Immigrant Pain"},{"text":"Its because it works.

Let me break it down:Relative Prices vs. Absolute Prices:\\nI get what youre saying about tariffs raising relative prices, but in practice, this often spills over into higher absolute prices. For example, tariffs on things like steel or semiconductors increase production costs for manufacturers, and those costs usually get passed down the supply chain. Thats how you end up with cost-push inflation, which doesnt rely on changes in aggregate demand to happen.Elasticity of Demand and Supply:\\nI agree that passing on costs depends on elasticities, but a lot of the goods impacted by tariffslike electronics or raw materialsare pretty price-inelastic. People dont just stop buying them because they cost more, and there usually arent cheaper substitutes readily available. This means higher prices tend to stick, especially when domestic producers cant scale up fast enough to fill the gap.Domestic Producers and Competition:\\nThe idea that domestic producers would lower prices due to less demand doesnt really hold up in most cases. Tariffs often reduce competition from cheaper imports, giving domestic producers the room to raise their prices. So instead of downward pressure, you often see prices going up across the board.Monetary Expansion and Inflation:\\nWhile its true that sustained inflation usually ties back to monetary policy, tariffs can still drive sector-specific inflation. Look at the U.S.-China trade war: tariffs caused higher prices for things like washing machines, electronics, and even some agricultural goods. That may not spike aggregate price levels immediately, but it still adds noticeable inflationary pressure.Real-World Evidence:\\nTheoretical models are great, but the real-world evidence paints a different picture. Tariffs have consistently been shown to increase costs for consumers and businesses alike. Even if they dont single-handedly cause aggregate inflation, their effects on input costs, supply chains, and reduced competition are significant and hard to ignore.So yeah, while tariffs alone might not drive runaway inflation, they definitely create upward price pressures that ripple through the economy. Its more nuanced than just saying no inflation because aggregate demand doesnt change.","title":"Trump Admits He Cant Guarantee Tariffs Wont Cost Americans, Because Thats Exactly How Tariffs Work"},{"text":"ask anyone","title":"McDonalds"},{"text":"Unlikely.

Your platform and spending priorities signal to the broader economy in a million different ways what your priorities are. That, in turn, affects the way people invest (or choose not to invest). So if a boom follows Trump's election, that is principally a reaction among investors to Trump's proposed policies and their assessment about whether they'll make money -- or lose money -- as a result. \\"Biden inflation\\" was a direct product of the Democrats enormous spending post-election in 2020, after Trump had already spent a ton of money and sparked inflation. Sure, the economy has its own internal forces, and you can't simply turn it one way or another like a speedboat, but you can certainly influence its direction. Ultimately, nothing influences it more than investors' belief in your policies and what those policies mean for them financially. If people have no confidence in your ability to govern, or they think you're about to implement high-tax policies, they'll hold onto their money and the result is less investment, lower economic growth and, ultimately, lower levels of employment and lower levels of consumer spending. The notion that the US president has nothing to do with the direction of the national economy isn't correct. On a day-to-day basis, OK. But his broader ideology, and his priorities, affect what people believe -- and that, in turn, influences the economy in very direct ways. Trump's attitude to the energy sector, as one example, will produce meaningful economic results, probably fairly quickly.","title":"Trump Admits He Cant Guarantee Tariffs Wont Cost Americans, Because Thats Exactly How Tariffs Work"},{"text":"Hell be glad to show you the plan as soon as the audits are over.

Most studies show the vast majority falling on the consumer, but this happens through lower wages and employment (much like corporate taxes and payroll taxes), not through higher prices, unless the fed stimulates demand through increasing the money supply It doesnt matter if the domestic producer can match the price or not.

There seemed to be no obvious path back to power. They took back both houses of Congress two years later and the White House in 2008. - After Bush 41 beat Dukakis in 1988, Democrats were rudderless and plagued by infighting. In the wake of the Gulf War in 1991, Bush seemed unbeatable. Clinton won the first of two terms the next year instead. - In 1964, LBJ and the Democrats obliterated the Republicans in one of the biggest landslides in presidential election history. Four years later, his reputation was in tatters and Nixon won. \\nThe only difference between your doom-and-gloom scenario and the others is that the 2024 election just happened. Parties change, electorates change, and circumstances change. It will happen again. Many, many voters seem to have forgotten what Trump 1.0 was like: that establishment Republicans stifled his worst instincts, that he inherited a strong economy, and that the wave of inflation began and was partly caused by Trump. All of these things will be different during Trump 2.0. A lot of Trumps voters dont think hell actually do the worst things hes promised and dont understand the negative consequences of what he insists hell do. When those things hit the fan, Trump - who has never, ever once had an average approval rating above 50% - will become quite unpopular, even by his standards. And Republicans will gradually begin abandoning him because hell be a lame duck who cant help them anymore. Does that mean that Democrats will be able to fully cash in on that? Not necessarily. But they certainly wont be doomed because neither US major political party stays doomed for long.","title":"CMV: The Democrats are doomed in the long term."},{"text":"I would like to remind people that Whoopi thought Jill Biden would be an excellent Surgeon General because she thought she was an *actual* doctor.

And yes, most of them have seen some horrible things and need a lot of help. People whove not read up on the foster care system have a very rosy view of what kids have gone through and the trauma theyve experienced and how it changes you.Im glad your adoption was happy. Babies adopted at birth have much better outcomes and the majority, if adopted by good families, are as happy as any other child. (I personally have a lot of skepticism for theories of the primal wound myself, but it is true that there will always be some aspect of adoption to deal with psychologically for all adopted children, and some will grapple more with the questions to raises than others). But at this point in time, the flawed CPS system is to keep families together. They will return children to homes that have had other children permanently removed. They will return children to homes where they are repeatedly abused. They will return children to parents who have tried to kill them. So when a child is finally forcibly removed from a family, you know that what theyve experienced is extreme beyond measure. I warn about this because Ive seen what CPS does to good potential foster parents. They dont treat them like they should. They dont educate them like they should and send them children with lower needs and manageable behaviours and slowly scale them to the more extreme cases when theyre sure they can handle it. That would make sense and keep foster parents from burning out.What they tend to do is lie. Lie a lot. Lie about the behavioural problems a kid has and feign ignorance when the foster parents end up in over their head with a kid who actively terrorizes them. Im talking kids who attack their foster parents and injure them for life, kids who set their foster familys pets on fire, kids who molest the other kids in the house or set fire to the house.\\nSo anyone getting into this needs to know the state of CPS and social services. They need to do this because they want to HELP THOSE KIDS SPECIFICALLY. Not because oh the planet is so messed up, just oughta do it for the ones already here! That phrase is a cliche that fostering agencies immediately red flag. The good ones will push back hard on it, because its an awful attitude to have and will completely undermine the mentality you need to work with foster youth. Its not about environmentalism or whatever political cause du jour or because you feel like its pragmatic - its about the damn kids. And they need people who care about them specifically, and who can handle the incredibly difficult work of rehabilitating them. It is a commitment well beyond the typical child and parent bond, and may not even ever be a child and parent bond. It comes with immense sacrifices and struggles and it absolutely has to be a vocation, not something you just do in lieu of having a natural child. If you go to foster parent sub right here on Reddit, you will see what Ive said said there in so many different ways. These kids arent a project for a greener earth, or a consolation prize. They are victims of abuse and trauma and they need to be supported by serious people who can handle that. Im just tired of people saying these flippant things without any insight.","title":"Same-sex couples are fast-tracking plans to marry and have kids before Trump takes office"},{"text":"We need to see another whiner cry how unfair trump is, been there done that ad nauseum.","title":"An Apparently Delusional Liz Cheney Threatens Donald Trump's DOJ With 'Sanctions' If They Investigate Her ??"},{"text":"Well I hope youre right and that what you experienced happens across all industries.

Prices have continued to go up at a fairly steady rate during both presidents, it has never ever gone down.   And I buy a lot of the stuff every month.

The government processes money to contractors.  The entire federal workforce accounts for about 5% of the federal budget.  The rest flows out as aid, grants, and contracts for goods (like new roads, bridges, and military aircraft) and services (like air traffic control, law enforcement, and national defense).  If Trump makes cuts to the federal workforce the net effect will be less efficient purchasing of those goods and services.

He also campaigned on a promise to impose an across-the-board, 10-per-cent to 20-per-cent tariff on imports from all countries.Speaking to the Halifax Chamber of Commerce on Monday, Mr. Trudeau said that tariffs at this level would have a devastating impact on the Canadian economy, while also damaging the U.S. economy and driving up prices for American consumers.Ottawa would respond to unfair tariffs in a number of ways, and were still looking at the right ways to respond, Mr. Trudeau said.He highlighted Canadas response to tariffs Mr. Trump imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum products in 2018, during his first presidency. Canada imposed counter-tariffs on American steel and aluminum and also went after specific U.S. products with targeted tariffs.It wasnt that Americans were paying more for their steel and aluminum, although that was annoying to some people in the States. It was the fact that we put tariffs on Bourbon and Harley Davidsons and playing cards and Heinz ketchup and cherries and a number of other things that were very carefully targeted... [and] politically impactful to the Presidents party and colleagues, Mr. Trudeau said.We were able to punch back in a way that was actually felt by Americans, he added.Mr. Trudeau said that its important to take Mr. Trump seriously when it comes to tariff threats. At the same time, he said that Mr. Trump often looks to destabilize a negotiating partner, to offer uncertainty and even sometimes a bit of chaos into the well established hallways of democracies and institutions.One of the most important things for us to do is not to freak out, not to panic, he said.Canada needs to show a unified response to the threats of tariffs, Mr. Trudeau said, citing his collaboration with Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe in 2018 to counter U.S. tariffs.His voice with governors down south, his making the case for Canadian workers and Canadian trade in a way that complemented the arguments that we were making, did a better job of showing what Canadian unity was, he said.Mr. Trudeau said that Canada is looking for a win-win solution to Mr. Trumps trade and security concerns that benefit businesses and consumers on both sides of the border. However, he acknowledged that Ottawa is facing a more difficult environment than last time Mr. Trump entered the White House.Its going to be a little more challenging. Theyre coming in with a lot clearer set of ideas of what they want to do right away than they had last time.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) stopped short of offering an outright apology for sharing conspiracy theories about the hammer attack on Paul Pelosi. After the brutal assault on Nancy Pelosis 82-year-old husband during a break-in at their San Francisco home in October, Cruz was one of many right-wing figures who pushed spurious claims about the alleged attacker, David DePape. Cruz shared a screenshot of a thread by far-right troll Matt Walsh which claimed it was absurd to call DePape a militant right wingerdespite reports that DePape had posted on far-right blogs. Truth, Cruz captioned the screenshot on Twitter. \\nhttps://time.com/6226946/paul-pelosi-attack-gop-response-political-discourse/As House Speaker Nancy Pelosis 82-year-old husband Paul lay in a San Francisco hospital with a skull fracture from a late-night home intruder over the weekend, Donald Trump Jr. thought it would be a good time for jokes.The son of a former President on Sunday retweeted a photo of a Paul Pelosi Halloween costume showing underwear and a hammer, a reference to a debunked conspiracy theory about the attack. On Monday, he posted to Instagram a lewd cartoon image promoting the same conspiracy theory. Dear fact checkers this has nothing at all to do with anything going on in the news, he wrote.\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/05/us/politics/pelosi-attack-misinfo-republican-politicians.htmlWithin hours of the brutal attack last month on Paul Pelosi, the husband of the speaker of the House, activists and media outlets on the right began circulating groundless claims  nearly all of them sinister, and many homophobic  casting doubt on what had happened. Some Republican officials quickly joined in, rushing to suggest that the bludgeoning of an octogenarian by a suspect obsessed with right-wing conspiracy theories was something else altogether, dismissing it as an inside job, a lovers quarrel or worse. The misinformation came from all levels of Republican politics. A U.S. senator circulated the view that none of us will ever know what really happened at the Pelosis San Francisco home. A senior Republican congressman referred to the attacker as a nudist hippie male prostitute, baselessly asserting that the suspect had a personal relationship with Mr. Pelosi. Former President Donald J. Trump questioned whether the attack might have been staged.The worlds richest man helped amplify the stories. But none of it was true.  The flood of falsehoods showed how ingrained misinformation has become inside the G.O.P., where the reflexive response of the rank and file  and even a few prominent figures  to anything that might cast a negative light on the right is to deflect with more fictional claims, creating a vicious cycle that muddies facts, shifts blame and minimizes violence. It happened after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, which was inspired by Mr. Trumps lie of a stolen election, and in turn gave rise to more falsehoods, as Republicans and their right-wing allies tried to play down, deny or invent a different story for what happened, including groundlessly blaming the F.B.I. and antifa. Mr. Pelosis attacker is said to have believed some of those tales.","title":"Ted Cruz: CEO-shooting person of interests views show leftism is a mental disease"},{"text":"Id rather it be someone like Byron Donalds or Ashley Moody","title":"Lara Trump announces she is stepping down as RNC co-chair amidst talk she may be up for Florida Senate seat"},{"text":"The hatred was sweet while it lasted.

It's a very weak one and It's been largely debunked. No one forced banks to give loans to people who couldn't qualify for them. No one forced banks to skip the verification process. Neither congress nor the DNC suggested to the securities ratings companies that they should misrepresent the quality of the mortgages that made up the instruments that failed and began the collapse. In fact the banks pay the fees of the companies who vouch for the quality of the instruments those banks packaged up for sale to an unsuspecting public. The incentive to do all that was greed and it was weaponized, in some significant part, by the dismantling of New Deal era banking regulations and oversight. The fetish for deregulation is well understood to be a conservative disease and Neoliberal (read Conservative) Democrats have done very little to curb it. The problem with assuming the 'liberal' policies were all good is that you are using hindsight and survivorship bias. Generally, nobody rememebers the proposals that never were implemented nor do they remember the policies that were tried and failed. It is just looking back at the successes and assuming everything was a success.I never said nor meant to imply that all liberal policies and leadership were \\"all good\\" nor does do I suggest that some of what they didn't accomplish was bad. (If you have a list of these supposed atrocities I'm all ears). I'm pointing to the inarguable fact that they were successful and effective and produced the greatest advancement in prosperity for working class people in history. If you are suggesting that there were hare-brained liberal schemes that were thwarted by conservative opposition in the period, please share some examples. Again, I'm not suggesting that either the liberals of the time or their programs were perfect. But I can still point to the period 1932\\\\~1968 when policy was dominated by liberal leadership and compare it to the period 1968\\\\~2024 when conservatives began steering policy and the largely disastrous change in outcomes from one to the other is unmistakeable. The conclusion one is to draw from this is that we might have done much better if that liberal momentum had suffered from less conservative friction.  What do we find after 50 years of conservative resurgence? Two financial crises exceeded only by the Great Depression, the injurious dissolution of anti-trust regulation, erosion of unions, worker protections, wages, civil rights. Housing and higher education moving ever further out of reach. Qanon idiocy and fear-mongering substituted for serious political discourse, the hollowing out of the middle class so that millionaires can reach into our pockets and become billionaires. A significant percentage of qualified voters are unhappy with a political party that does the bidding of oligarchs, that puts policy up for sale, that fails to advance and protect the interests of average working Americans. Lots of Trump supporters say that's why they voted for him, because they believe (in spite of all the evidence) that he's going to serve working people, lower their taxes, \\"drain the swamp.\\" In fact of the two parties the D's are the ones who fight (weakly) for working people. In fact, while Democrats are right in the swamp with Republicans, they don't wallow in it publicly and there is at least some agitation in the party to change conditions. And between the two, calls for making billionaires pay their share of the cost of civilization only comes from Dems. THAT is the direction the DNC needs to move in. Not performatively, not rhetorically. Fiercely. Moderates (Obama, Biden, Pelosi) don't believe in the New Deal. Centrists, Neoliberals will not save us. This is political opinion, not a fact.It's an opinion borne out by a survey of the performance of the two philosophies for the last century and an appreciation for the routine trajectory of radical right-wing movements across the globe in the same period.

I just like it because it makes some interesting factoids and with this cycle done we've got 3 Representatives returning to the House.Gil Cisneros in CA-31: Good ole Gil was first elected in 2018 when he defeated Young Kim in CA-39. Which led to one of my favorite moments in the old Blue Midterm 2018 history because before the election was called some weirdo conversative posted a picture of Young Kim on r/ pics calling her the first female Korean representative. The cons in the comments then circlejerked themselves and chided liberals for not talking about it. And then the votes kept coming in and Gil eventually emerged the victor in that race, leading to a response post on rpics by someone  with him. Unfortunately Gil was defeated by Kim in the rematch in 2020, leaving the house in 2021. Though he later joined the Biden Administration as an Under Secretary of Defense. He would leave the Biden Admin in fall of 2023, and announced he was running in the vacant CA-31; a race that he would later win. With one term in the House he'll be given seniority over the 2024 Freshmen but under those who were elected in special elections during the 118th congress.Marlin Stutzman in IN-03: Stutzman's got a rather interesting history of how he got into the house, he ran in the 2010 Republican primary for Senate where he placed second behind Dan Coats. However Stutzman's D.C dreams weren't squandered as the incumbent rep of IN-03 Mark Souder resigned after winning the primary due to an affair with a staffer. Stutzman was chosen to take his place on the ballot winning the simultaneous special/regular elections. He would be elected to two more terms until choosing to retire to run for Senate in 2016; losing to Todd Young and then disappearing from politics until 2023. With his successor running for Senate, Stutzman announced he would be running in the crowded primary for his old seat which he would narrowly win and later win the general election. Due to how seniority is calculated he would be credited with 3 terms if I'm correct (2010 Regular, 2012, 2014) so if I'm understanding the rules correctly I believe he would be given seniority over those elected 2020.Cleo Fields in LA-06: Probably one of the most unique cases of returning to the house that I've seen since I've started following politics. Fields was first elected in 1992 in LA-04 and was subsequently reelected to a second term in 1994. He would then run for governor of Louisiana in 1995 which at least according to his wikipedia page led to a lot of drama between him and future Senator Mary Landrieu, this loss and him being redistricted to LA-05 led to him not seeking a third term in 1996. Fields would return to the Louisiana state senate in 1997, later being revealed to have been caught on tape by the FBI accepting 20,000 dollars in cash from then governor Edwin Edwards though Fields was never indicted on any charges in the case. He'd serve in the State Senate until he was term limited in 2008, though he'd return to the state senate once again in 2020 after his successor was term limited. After LA was forced to make a second VRA compliant district in 2024, Fields jumped into the race on the same day for the new LA-06. Fields would clear 50 percent on election day avoiding a runoff despite the presence of 3 other democratic candidates leading to his return to US House after 27 years. Now I don't know everyone who's ever been elected to the House but I think Fields might hold the record for longest time between terms, the only other case like this I've seen is when Kweisi Mfume was reelected in 2020 after 24 years. But onto seniority Fields will be given credit for one term if I understand how seniority works so I believe he will be given seniority over those who were elected in 2022.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 9, 2024"},{"text":"When the shit hits the fan (and it will), no one will admit voting for Trump.","title":"Trump Admits He Cant Guarantee Tariffs Wont Cost Americans, Because Thats Exactly How Tariffs Work"},{"text":"Abortion is not a right.

That doesn't mean that farmers are my enemy, though you seem to want to put that on me.Now, if you just want me to dis Trump, I can do that.  As I've said previously, tariffs will cause a lot of pain over the short and intermediate term before the benefits of them begin to come about.  Trump failed to properly prepare voters for that pain.  Cutting social services while simultaneously imposing steep tariffs is incredibly dumb.  Tariffs should be targeted towards specific countries that either don't meet American standards on something (Worker pay, worker safety, environmental standards, stuff like that) or for certain critical industries that America wants to protect.  Blanket tariffs on Canada is dumb.  As with any major economic policy, there will be devils in the details, and Trump doesn't give a shit about details.

And even if Trump takes no direct action against Powell, he will have the chance to appoint a new Fed Chair when the current term ends in 2026.

The US really tends to favor late-stage and heavily interventional care, which performed by specialists who are paid an insane amount.  At the same time, groups such as the AMA have done a great job at restricting medical school and residency slots.Insurance restricting care and trying to override doctors looks really bad but the truth is that any sort of rework of the healthcare system, which is long overdue, is going to cause massive changes in how healthcare is administered and that is going to in turn cause massive blowback.  With the massive undersupply of doctors and different expectations of care in the US, change is going to have to be a long-term process, which is exactly what we tried to kick off with the ACA.  Dems have been trying to fundamentally change how the healthcare system works since at the least the 1970s (40s if you count what Truman tried) and it has quite literally blown up in their faces about once a decade, even when the reform passes.Edit: and as if he read my mind, Noah Smiths (whatever you think of him, he is a trained economist) [latest substack](https://substack.com/home/post/p-152827066) basically says the same thing (It's actually quite a good read).

For me, it's not to change the other person's mind, because so rarely will that ever happen. My entire goal is to prove them wrong, cite my evidence, sources, fact check them, etc. to show the audience watching our debate that their position is wrong and mine is right. People don't like to take accountability even after they've been proven wrong, so it's hopeless to try and debate people for the sake of convincing them. The point is to convince the audience, who may be on the fence on this particular issue. The point is also to educate and soap box a little because I understand that there are many people watching who don't fully understand this issue, and this would be a great opportunity to teach them now that I have an excuse to do so. Also, another main reason why I debate is so that I can change my mind. Because if someone provides great evidence, reasoning, logic, and proof that my position needs to be changed, then I will change my mind. I don't want to live in a delusion, so I actively engage with people who are diametrically opposed to me so that I can hear their arguments and determine if it's anything worth considering or looking into. If I determine it is, then I will do more research to try and hone my position and beliefs even more. I seek the truth, so that's why I debate. It's important to engage with people who have different perspectives from you, so that you can expand your own perspective and hone your beliefs. The pursuit of truth and having my beliefs be the most resolute and backed by truth they can possibly be, is extremely important to me.","title":"CMV: In todays world, debate/ argument is the single most redundant thing that you can do."},{"text":"Its amazing this country voted Trump as the next President.

Lovegrove was supposed to release the report in October, but it has still not been published. However, Alexander Gray, a national security-focused White House aide in Trumps first term, told Politico that there was good reason for the aforementioned queasiness. The former chief of staff to Trumps National Security Council said we need to have a serious discussion given the demands on U.S. Navy attack submarine fleet, adding that were not on track to reach the minimum requirements for our own needs.\\nIf you take America first literally, and people should, then you should not be surprised if a serious American defense official comes and says we have to prioritize construction or repair needs for our own purposes, Gray added. That doesnt question the validity of AUKUS, or mean its not a priority, but we need to start looking at these commitments in an American-centric way that may not meet up with the priorities of Canberra and London. Gray also savaged Keir Starmer for his decision to meet with President Xi just days after Trumps reelection, labeling the British prime ministers attempts to improve Sino-British relations as regrettable.One of the successes of Trumps term, and the Biden-Harris administration, was a significant amount of mutual understanding of partners in London and Europe writ large about the danger China poses globally, he said. I hate to see backsliding like this at the very start of a Trump administration. This attempted UK-China reset will likely be high on the list of talking points when Healey meets with his Australian counterpart Richard Marles next month in London for an AUKMIN summit. The Australian Labor government, after all, has conducted a similar reset with the Chinese government since coming to power in 2022 after relations hit a nadir during COVID. Also at the top of the agenda will be how to sell the incoming president on the AUKUS deal in a positive way. A second defense industry insider said the British and Australian governments should try to badge the deal in terms that make it look like Trump has personally won from the deal. Everybody is worried about Americas lack of industrial capacity and how it affects AUKUS, they said. He is also instinctively against the idea of America being the worlds police and so he may not see the value in AUKUS at all, but they need to let him own it and make him think hes won by doing it. Sophia Gaston, the London-based UK foreign policy lead at Canberras ASPI think tank, said most people in Trumps orbit can find some element of the project which chimes with their interests.Britain and Australia need to work in complete lockstep on AUKUS in Washington, and recognize that they must embrace more tactical and strategic language grounded in American self-interest, she said. There will also be a need to demonstrate how AUKUS can deliver short-term wins, which ensure the projects deterrence effect is credible. While the core nuclear submarine deal will get most of the headlines in the coming months, progress on the lesser-known Pillar II of AUKUS also remains somewhat elusive. Launched alongside the submarine pact, Pillar II was designed to codevelop a range of military technologies, such as quantum-enabled navigation, artificial intelligence-enhanced artillery, and electronic warfare capabilities. One Pillar II technology-sharing deal was struck on hypersonic missiles just last month, but expected progress on a range of other areas has not transpired. Ambitions to admit Japan to the Pillar II partnership this year have also gone unfulfilled. Meanwhile, there seemed to be a step forward when the Biden administration introduced legislation to ease the trade of sensitive technology between the three nations earlier this summer. But while it was dubbed a historic breakthrough by the UK, pro-Trump Sen. Jim Risch, the most senior Republican on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, complained it was overly restrictive and limited progress on AUKUS Pillar II. I couldnt be more dissatisfied with the pace of implementation, he said. It is not moving at the speed of relevance. However, some U.S. policy wonks are somewhat more optimistic about the future of the program.\\nBryan Clark, director of the Center for Defense Concepts and Technology at the Hudson Institute, said Trump might channel some funds from Pillar I into Pillar II. He said: Can we siphon some of that money off to support Pillar II, because it gives us a faster benefit? The tech startup community is going to be entering the administration in official and unofficial positions, so I think well find their influence will protect some of these investments. There surely wont be long to wait until the president-elect comes down from on high to give his opinion on AUKUS. All interested parties will no doubt be watching X and Truth Social for when that moment arrives.","title":"Will Donald Trump kill US-UK-Aussie sub defense deal?"},{"text":"I hate that he was found.","title":"Fox News hosts slam GOP lawmaker after cousin is arrested for health care CEO shooting"},{"text":"You're missing the point but ok","title":"JD Vance backs Trump on Syria: This is not our fight"},{"text":" There are few issues on which we do not know Donald Trumps opinion. After thousands of hours of interviews and speeches over the past eight years, the president-elect has enlightened us on what he thinks on almost any topic which enters his brain at any given moment. But in the key area of defense, there are some gaps  and thats leading global military chiefs to pore over the statements of the presidents allies and appointees to attempt to glean some clues, specifically over the $369 billion trilateral submarine program known as AUKUS he will inherit from Joe Biden. Trump does not appear to have publicly commented on the AUKUS pact  named for its contingent parts Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States  which would see the U.S. share technology with its partners to allow both countries to build state-of-the-art nuclear submarines by the 2040s. This uncertainty has left ministers and government officials in London and Canberra scrambling to discover how the Republican is likely to view the Biden-era deal when he returns to the White House in January. Two defense industry figures told Politico there were serious concerns in the British government that Trump might seek to renegotiate the deal or alter the timelines. This is because the pact likely requires the U.S. to temporarily downsize its own naval fleet as a part of the agreement  something Trump may interpret as an affront to his America First ideology. There is hope in Westminster that Trump would be in favor of a military project which is an obvious, if unspoken, challenge to China. The deal would see American-designed nuclear submarines right on Chinas doorstep and would form a part of Australias attempts to bolster its military might in the Indo-Pacific.  When former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in September 2021 that the deal was not intended to be adversarial toward China, President Xi Jinping simply did not believe him. The Chinese leader said AUKUS would undermine peace and accused the Western nations of stoking a Cold War mentality. Mary Kissel, a former senior adviser to Trumps ex-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, said you can assume Trump two will look a lot like Trump one when it comes to building alliances with other Western countries against China. We revivified the Quad [Australia, India, Japan and the U.S.], got our allies to bolster NATO funding and worked to prevent China from dominating international institutions, she said. However, the deal also forces the U.S. government to sell Australia three to five active Virginia attack submarines, the best in the U.S. Navys fleet, by the early 2030s as a stopgap until the new AUKUS subs are built. This coincides with a time where there is a widely recognized crunch on Americas industrial defense capacity. In laymans terms, the U.S. is currently struggling to build enough submarines or military equipment for its own needs. One UK defense industry figure, granted anonymity to speak freely, said there was a lot of queasiness in the UK government and a huge amount of queasiness in Australia about whether Trump would allow this to happen. There is a world in which the Americans cant scale up their domestic submarine capacity for their own needs and dont have spare to meet Australias needs, they said. If you started pulling on one thread of the deal, then the rest could easily fall away.One UK government official played down how much London and Canberra are worried about the future of the deal, however. They said the UK government was confident Trump is positive about the deal and that the U.S. was well equipped with the number of submarines for their fleet. In Washington too, defense experts are seeking clues to the attitude of the incoming administration. While close observers agree it is too soon to predict what Trump would do about AUKUS, there has been some reason for optimism in the president-elects selection of two China hawks for top national security posts: Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), as secretary of state, and Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) as national security adviser. \\nBoth served on the congressional foreign affairs committees that handled legislation to authorize AUKUS and will be well aware that it has broad bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress, giving AUKUS advocates on Capitol Hill two well-placed former colleagues with whom they can make their case to Trump world.  But the brightest glimmer of hope may be an Economist essay Waltz co-authored last month that slams Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for a rash of global crises, but reserves a some praise for AUKUS.  Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris have taken some positive steps on China, such as strengthening export controls and establishing AUKUS, a trilateral security partnership with Britain and Australia, but these have been more than outweighed by the distraction caused by failed policies in Europe and the Middle East, Waltz wrote with Matthew Kroenig, a former Pentagon strategist. !ping UK&amp;AUS","title":"Will Donald Trump kill US-UK-Aussie sub defense deal?"},{"text":"Dont forget the army of influencers Russia funds to spread their propaganda.","title":"Elon Musks Stunning $250 Million Favor to Trump Should Wake Up Dems"},{"text":"Does understand if you are born a US citizen, or are a naturalized citizen, this IS YOUR FUCKING COUNTRY?","title":"Trumps Frightening New Deportation Threat Targets Americans Too - Donald Trump says hell deport U.S. citizens too."},{"text":"Many people don't share your beliefs.

So we're probably waiting on 2026 for those two.* FL-01 - One Democrat, [Gay Valimont,](https://gayforcongress.com/) qualified for the ballot.  She's got a solid profile and this area has some surprising potential for Dems in places like Pensacola and Fort Walton Beach.  Winning is a longshot but it's a good chance to engage some new voters and start winning FL back.* FL-06 - At least two Dems are running, teacher Josh Weil and businessman Ges Selmont.  The primary is January 28th, so we won't have a candidate until then, but this seat is actually the more winnable Florida race.  Still a longshot but worth the effort, especially if the national mood changes as much as I think it will.* NY-21 - This election hasn't been called yet, as Stefanik hasn't resigned at this point.  I've heard some rumblings about people getting involved, but nothing certain yet.  I absolutely think this one is worth contesting, as it could flip if everything goes right.So we've got people running where possible, and I'm sure more will follow.  But building hype?

The trade barriers are created by a web of jurisdictional barriers; truly eliminating them would require provinces to give up control of professional certification &amp; regularion, provincial liquor control boards, vehicle weight standards, permits, construction codes, and more. So what body would take over all of these areas? Presumably, the federal government. But it's become a Canadian tradition for provincial and federal governments to blame each other for issues while failing to address them. I can't imagine a world where every province willingly gives up significant regulatory authority to the federal government. So I don't see how, politically, Canada can get itself out of this mess. There's been some agonizingly slow movement towards provinces signing agreements to recognize each other's professional certifications, but at the same time provinces have jealously guarded things like liquor sales.","title":"ANALYSIS | One solution to weathering Trump's tariffs | CBC News"},{"text":"Newsflash: fascists are pussies","title":"Trump is the softest, weakest man to ever hold elected office"},{"text":"They are all gonna fight with each other","title":"Trump pledges unity  then says rivals should go to jail"},{"text":"He got a blow job!

The idea stems back to a clean/unclean dichotomy. God is holy/clean/good; anything that opposes him is unnatural/unclean/bad. God as the epitome of all good must smite evil or wipe it away. Sinning against God isnt just being naughty to them; it puts that being in direct contradiction to the forces of good: they are now unnatural/unclean/evil until made clean again. The only way to make something clean again is death: blood sacrifice. In the Old Testament, this was animal sacrifices at the temple; in the New Testament this is supposedly superseded by Jesus sacrifice and death. So: boiling that mindset back down to your question. Death Row is killing people whove sinned - in that state they are an unnatural affront to God, pure evil, unclean corruption. Fetuses have had no chance to sin, so they are in a state of purity/good/holiness (like god) and should never be harmed.  Now you might ask If Jesus sacrifice supersedes the need for blood sacrifice and weve all been made clean before god, why does that selectively not seem to apply to Death Row inmates, LGBT folks, mothers out of wedlock, etc?

You try to show any of this to the MAGA or even just centrists that voted for him and they will claim this is all fake news or liberal biased media. When the tariffs go in and prices skyrocket, they will turn around and blame foreign countries, maybe a few greedy businesses if they don't come off as devoutly conservative, and obviously Joe Biden and any Democratic elected official, claiming they caused it somehow. Even when he made that claim that everything was fine until Biden took over, there are people who seriously believe the economy tanks solely because a Democrat was elected. I mean they just think that the mere election of a Democrat, no matter how brilliant, visionary, and intelligent they are, immediately will make the economy tank. They have this belief that businesses and the \\"job creators\\" pull back when a Democrat is elected and that's what causes the economy to tank. Even if that were totally true, I would then ask them if they really like having the country being run by these oligarchs. I asked them what happened to all of that freedom they talk about. It's the same deal with crime. You show them statistics, and they just show you social media videos of everybody capturing everything out there, and even at times showing things that happened in foreign countries and claiming it happened here. I remember this broad daylight jewelry robbery happening in a mall, and everybody blaming Chicago, and then it was pointed out this happened in New Zealand. Let's also not forget how many of these nuts that follow every single crime thing always keep pushing the narrative that minorities cause most of the crime in the US, when that's not even true. And there you have it. If any of Joe Biden's economic initiatives bear fruit in the next 4 years, these people will instantly think Trump magically did it just because he was elected. If the economy tanks during Trump's time, they will blame Joe Biden and anyone in the Democratic party. In their eyes. They think the Republican party can do no wrong, and politifact in their eyes is fake news propaganda while anything makes Trump out to be completely honest and Democrats to be the biggest liars in the world is the unbiased media. So what's the point? They're never going to listen. I say let the pain hit and let them suffer.","title":"Fact-checking Donald Trumps interview with Meet the Press"},{"text":"Social security isnt a pool at all.

Berkowitz analyses the moral, social, historical, and ultimately political claims of \\"woke\\" ideology and suggests that their appeal is fundamentally circumscribed. As he writes, \\"\\\\[This ideology\\\\] rankles men and women of all races and ethnicities who believe that America, for all its shortcomings, remains a land of hope and opportunity.\\" Berkowitz, who has spent much of his life working in and around universities, singles out the role of elite institutions in perpetuating a view of the world that seeks to divide individuals and communities on the basis of race, sex, or other supposed \\"oppressed/oppressor\\" delineator. Berkowitz ultimately argues that if elite universities cannot contain the divisive form of progressivism they have become synonymous with over the past ten years, they will unwittingly drive more Americans into the arms of the right of center coalition that opposes this worldview. He concludes:If elite universities teach that group identity takes precedence over the dignity of the person, graduates will regard themselves as duty bound to trample over individual rights in pursuit of social justice.And if our elite universities C and the graduates they annually launch into the world C keep it up, they will increase the Trump coalitions chances of landslide election victories and enhance the prospects of a national political realignment built around working-class men and women joined by individuals of all colors and classes who cherish freedom and democracy in America.","title":"Opposition to Woke Progressivism Energizes Trump Coalition"},{"text":"They say that, but every time we touch it, they wipe us out in the next election (ie 1994 and 2010).?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 9, 2024"},{"text":"Bruh.

No one has the right to arbitrarily take another's life. However, when an individual deliberately violates this right, such as through murder or other heinous acts, they forfeit their own claim to it. Capital punishment, in such cases, becomes not only acceptable but a moral imperative for justice and deterrence.As a result, no one has the right to take that away. Now, when someone decides they have that right, be it a murderer acting in cold blood, someone who gets heated and draws a knife, a \\"robbery gone wrong\\" (which is an asinine concept to begin with,) or a drunk driver who was far too careless in his actions and takes someone else's rights to life away. They then lose their own right to life. Thus, submitting them to execution is perfectly acceptable and arguably the moral thing to do. (I would personally rather be executed than life for 50-60 years in prison with no chance of leaving.)Execution should be reserved for the gravest offenses, applied with the utmost care to avoid misuse or wrongful conviction. While a justice system must be cautious, the death penalty serves a dual purpose: as a punishment for those who irreparably harm others and as a safeguard against recidivism.In cases of self-defense, where ones right to life is directly threatened by anothers actions, the use of lethal force can be justified. The distinction lies in the immediacy of the threat and the absence of intent to violate another's rights outside self-preservation.By contrast, the innocent, such as unborn infants, have committed no such violations and thus retain their unassailable right to life. Justice requires that punishment aligns with guilt, not with the circumstance of existence. Thus, abortion is murder.","title":"Trump Preps Bloodbath on Federal Death Row As Advocates Beg Biden for Mercy"},{"text":"No they didn't, roe was argued based on the right to privacy, we have a right to privacy, as well as a right to bodily autonomybodily autonomy isn't a right given to us by the government, we are born with itbut your a brain dead maga troll so i shouldn't be surprised you dont understand that basic knowledge","title":"Trump Wont Commit to Protecting Abortion Pills"},{"text":"Because Republicans fear that which is different from them, and they fear trans people to such an extent we are perceived as an existential threat.","title":"House Republicans are trying to ban gender-affirming care for youth in new military budget"},{"text":"What, the truth?","title":"Tim Walz surprised that he and Kamala Harris lost election to Donald Trump"},{"text":"Exactly.

Fair. Im white myself, but to be honest, I think I can see both sides of that coin. Im not a woman or a POC, so I dont get what thats really like, no, but I personally still feel pretty threatened by these people, too. I know its not the same, but I can at least empathize with how it must feel, to an extent. And, at the same time, I think this guy has a point about the class struggles we have that (ought to)  transcend other boundaries. At some point we need to start embracing that, even when it is coming from someone who we dont think really can see it like we do. I think we can acknowledge the differences in our social experiences AND rally behind a pro-working class movement at the same time. Thats how MLK did it, right?  By the way, that isnt to say I agree with everything he said (or how he chose to say it), Im just saying he aint wrong about the impact of class divides and tribalism. Even if his perspective on it is a bit white-centric. I do agree that his framing is off the mark given how many people feel the way you do about it. I dont think that should be seen strictly as a reason to invalidate it though, you know? In some sense, being too quick to do so might just lead to more tribalism and division at times. If you get what I mean there. Not trying to accuse, just pointing out how jumping to that sort of conclusion too early can be problematic in its own right. It keeps us from connecting with others who we might actually align with otherwise. I do think I get why you have pause over listening to this guy who sees things differently from you (indeed likely due to having a different racial experience than yours). And its a fair concern.

Berkowitz ultimately argues that if elite universities cannot contain the divisive form of progressivism they have become synonymous with over the past ten years, they will unwittingly drive more Americans into the arms of the right of center coalition that opposes this worldview. He concludes: If elite universities teach that group identity takes precedence over the dignity of the person, graduates will regard themselves as duty bound to trample over individual rights in pursuit of social justice.And if our elite universities C and the graduates they annually launch into the world C keep it up, they will increase the Trump coalitions chances of landslide election victories and enhance the prospects of a national political realignment built around working-class men and women joined by individuals of all colors and classes who cherish freedom and democracy in America.","title":"Opposition to Woke Progressivism Energizes Trump Coalition"},{"text":"Someone needs to tell him that he's become Elons puppet just to get his ego upset enough to remove Elon from and sorry if government.","title":"Trump is the softest, weakest man to ever hold elected office"},{"text":"Then his pardon of Hunter Biden is also worthless.

Theyll just vote for economic relief in the form of tax cuts and deregulation because those are clear to them.","title":"Cheney responds to Trump jail threat: Heres the truth"},{"text":"Fuck the press, they had their chance.

Some of them voted for Trump anyways, on the assumption that he is only going to target &lt;those people. Going to be a rude awakening when they find out they're someone else's &lt;those people and they're headed for the camps with the rest.The people not paying attention at this point aren't going to.Not sure what can be done at this point other than try to relocate to saf(er) areas. Safer depends a lot on how much the military can be suborned through purges of disloyal officers. Blue cities in red states are probably screwed - red state governors can wield the state Guard pretty effectively - but cracking blue states refusing to comply is going to need the national armed forces.","title":"Trump Privately Rages at Traitors, Revealing Darker Plans for 2025"},{"text":"I suppose as a start, student loan debt should be forgivable. It's one of the only forms of debt that bypasses bankruptcy and The premiums for student loans are far higher than for most forms of loan. These things entirely stem out of greed because anyone with lower income who wants to go to college is just going to have to take them out. It's a necessary payment. Student loan debt also is overwhelmingly harmful to low income students who can't afford it and are near to or have already gone bankrupt. I mean, I guess at the end of the day the problem is that I'm a socialist so I think that the whole capitalist economic system this is based on is fundamentally flawed and inherently abusive to people. Within the system I think there's plenty of positive changes we can make, but as it stands the current liberal status quo refuses to make anything but small changes that don't actually harm business profits.","title":"CMV: Jon Stewart will be a Ronald Reagan for the Democrats in 2028."},{"text":"Daddy is getting her a nomination","title":"Lara Trump says shes stepping down as Republican National Committee co-chair"},{"text":"His time is coming.","title":"Trump pledges unity  then says rivals should go to jail"},{"text":"I keep hearing how unlikable MVP is, but no specifics.
