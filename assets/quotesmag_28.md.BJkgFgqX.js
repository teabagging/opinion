IMO this new notion that \\"what he meant was...\\" the worst of the worst only, it sort of exists to make a lot of things...spongy in the mind and relieve tension over the obvious impracticality of trump's campaign rhetoric and promises.it has a couple main rhetorical functions:1. is to continue begging the question that there's a significant plurality of people in the opposite camp, that there's someone on team \\"don't deport violent criminals\\" - there are a few, a very few, anti-deportation absolutists in the far left but they have NO political voice. the democrats, the biden admin, the obama admin, etc - very deportative and always have been.\\n2. is to claim work in progress, a trump tradition.

When they're in charge, they're doing all they can but need the opposition to stop holding them back. when the opposition is in charge, they will absolutely SHRIEK the libel that the border is \\"open\\" - to the point they literally interview people at the border who say \\"I heard on fox news it is open\\" and are doing the shocked pikachu when they get here and it isn't.It's pure passive aggression and darvo.

It argues ideologically for policies benefiting the corporate rulers. The Republicans seek to convince the middle class and labor to support the rule of the wealthy with the argument that whats good for GM is good for the country, that what benefits corporations is also going to benefit regular people.**The Democratic Party is different. It acts as a broker negotiating and selling influence among broad layers of the people to support the objectives of corporate rule. The Democratic Partys core group of elected officials is rooted in careerists seeking self-promotion by offering to the corporate rulers their ability to control and deliver mass support.** And to the people they offer some concessions  modifications on the platform of the Republican Party. One important value of the Democratic Party to the corporate world is that it makes the Republican Party possible through the maintenance of stability essential for business as usual by preventing a genuine mass opposition from developing. Together the two parties offer one of the best possible frameworks within which to rule a people that otherwise would move society towards the rule of the people, i.e., democracy.An example of this process is our minimum wage laws. Adjusted to inflation, the minimum wage has been gradually declining for years. Every now and then the Democrats pass a small upward adjustment that allows the downward trend to continue but gives the appearance they are on the side of the poor. -Pete Camejo","title":"Dems need to learn how to use power"},{"text":"You're far right.

Letting more things through immediately post-Phase 1 means pointing a firehose of junk at the medical landscape. The primary efficacy discriminator for accelerated approvals is surrogate endpoints (e.g. quick biological measures that might correlate with long-term improvement.) As we pick off the 'low-hanging fruit', those get less and less predictive. The stubborn CNS diseases that often benefit from accelerated approval, for example, (Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, etc.) don't have even a single positive example from which to draw a surrogate endpoint! And the result is that the failure rate for post-accelerated approval confirmatory trials is [increasing even as Phase 3 trial failure rate in general is decreasing.](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(24)00353-2) For compassionate use scenarios, this mostly results in a [well-meaning waste of money](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-provides-update-phase-3-study-investigational-gene) but when accelerated approval drugs displace standard of care, there's high potential for real harm.

Please point to where I said that. Id love a direct quote.No, youre ignoring the fact that CEO is an elected or appointed position; that owners or shareholders *pick* (private, parent) or *elect* (public, traded) their CEO. Creating **affirmative action** for CEOs will not give you the kind of representation you want it would be cronies to the man who happen to be women, *not progressives*.  What I said was the owners and decision makers TENDED to be male because for the majority of the 18th and 19th century women were not able to (for a significant portion of that time,legally!) own businesses or property, at best without a man and at worst, at all.Right, and this has changed. This is no longer the trend; does this apply to cosmetics and makeup, considering how many new successful brands there are (past 20 years)? I see *a lot* of female executives coming up when Im searching household cosmetic brands\\n This has only significantly changed in the last 80 years and women could only get bank accounts, loans and credit cards without a man in the 1970s.Ok that was 64 years ago; times have changes. Womens re not disenfranchised when it comes to specifically banking and finance. So while women were journalists and writing articles and participating in the creation or running of magazines the people in financial and at times editorial control were predominantly men.Journalism was traditionally a mans job ?. Just because it was one of the first to allow *admins* who then segeweyed into Journalism is completely different. That is dishonest as to how it came about. Again, there is a difference between patriarchal structures and systems and men as a demographic.**designed for me** ?? You mean **designed by men for all of society**? Men as the **pre-dominant demographic,** sure, but policy had *always* included  man, women and child with caveat for elderly. This is all just historical context to explain how we got to where we are. And I did in fact say that women participate and perpetuate those patriarchal norms as well. So, what are you going on about?I fully understand the history of it. You are attributing motivations to these organizations that frankly dont even align with their values. Point: youre really being hyperbolic as to how systemic (**i.e. the byproducts of a system that revolves around a cis-white-male**) affected the individualIf youre claiming all men are conspiratorial and create the beauty standards for women, then sure, you feel that way and you disagree with OP_ Literally no. Patriarchy is not a conspiracy both in the sense that there is not a cabal of straight white men sitting in a conference room twirling their moustaches and purposely trying brainwash women and in the sense that its not a conspiracy theory Its just a description of the kind of society we live in where men tend to hold the majority of economic, social and political power. This is gained through the systemic disenfranchisement and devaluation of women. It is both explicit and implicit. Some actively believe and behave as though women are inferior to men while most of the time men unwillingly or unconsciously benefit from the systemic marginalization of women.Patriarchal society yes, and its not going anywhere dude I dont like sounding like a pessimist but we literally cannot create that paradigm shift away from patriarchy without destroying all institutions that currently exist. Even then, not all of society would follow suitYoure trying to educate me assuming ignorance not appreciate what I have to say. I filly understand your points and the principles they stem from.Do you think the tattood eyebrows trend in the 2000s was started by cabalist men trying to create more ways to profit off women? No. I do not think that. I think that women and men are taught that a womans primary value is being attractive to men and being expected to excel at domestic labor.  I think women are taught that their biggest achievement is getting married and having children. And thus, in order to exploit those patriarchal beliefs and earn money, companies create unrealistic and unattainable standards in order to get people to consume their products.Did you grow up on the bible belt in a rural town? I have not heard this rhetoric come out of *anyones* mouth, including my fathers generation. (Canadian). They did this with diamonds and engagement rings, they did this with lipstick and foundation, they did it with whiskey and shoes and all sorts of other consumer products. This is the nature of advertising.So who is actually baring the cost in these situations?? **traditionally always men dude**. Youre ignoring the fact that yes, its an overpriced and gouged industry, but **female autonomy is what perpetuates these costs**; they werent any cheaper when the hubby payed for it!!! Again, as I said predominantly or tended to imply that not all the owners or creative directors or ceos were men. Just that most of them are and that HISTORICALLY as the mediums began they were 99% of the time, men.**outside** of the cosmetics industry. There *are* female dominated industries. Likewise, there is tangible proof that many women do not want to enter jobs for resulting responsibilities.Think of jobs in demand: computers, stems, skilled trades. Women *barely* go into these. At first, in the 1800s and early 1900s the aim of those magazines was to teach women how to best appeal to, catch and keep a husband - because that was the ENTIRETY of womens role. Being mothers and wives. It is only in the second half of the 1900s (1950s/1960s) that there was significant change in how women engaged in and entered the workforce.Yeah because at that time womens right movements and suffrage hadnt happened Youre not arguing anything youre trying to give me a history lesson in the assumption that Im ignorant of it. Currently, yes. This is new though. This is not how the cosmetics industry has always been and this does not change what I have said. Again, in the comment you are responding to I have already said that women participate and perpetuate patriarchal norms.**YES THANK YOU. Were talking about current trends!!**Comment is too long. Wont allow me to rebuttal your comment by talking about homeless youth and male widows (disenfranchised men).Yes, I understand what systemic means. I dont know if you do(Patriarchy) is a system that revolves around a patriarchal home. So, when you implement these policies that are using a straight/white/male as the measuring rod, it creates *byproducts* for people who do not fit the quo.It *is not* instrumentally applying a patriarchy to maintain status quo.

Some actively believe and behave as though women are inferior to men while most of the time men unwillingly or unconsciously benefit from the systemic marginalization of women. _Do you think the tattood eyebrows trend in the 2000s was started by cabalist men trying to create more ways to profit off women?_No. I do not think that. I think that women and men are taught that a womans primary value is being attractive to men and being expected to excel at domestic labor. I think women are taught that their biggest achievement is getting married and having children. And thus, in order to exploit those patriarchal beliefs and earn money, companies create unrealistic and unattainable standards in order to get people to consume their products. They did this with diamonds and engagement rings, they did this with lipstick and foundation, they did it with whiskey and shoes and all sorts of other consumer products. This is the nature of advertising. _Im being serious as Im struggling to understand your point in the hyperbole. If you replaced a Mark Constantine as the owner &amp; CEO of lush; it doesnt change the fact that it was founded by 1 man and 4 women._Again, as I said predominantly or tended to imply that not all the owners or creative directors or ceos were men. Just that most of them are and that HISTORICALLY as the mediums began they were 99% of the time, men. At first, in the 1800s and early 1900s the aim of those magazines was to teach women how to best appeal to, catch and keep a husband - because that was the ENTIRETY of womens role. Being mothers and wives. It is only in the second half of the 1900s (1950s/1960s) that there was significant change in how women engaged in and entered the workforce. _Women are also more greatly represented in the cosmetics industry._Currently, yes. This is new though. This is not how the cosmetics industry has always been and this does not change what I have said. Again, in the comment you are responding to I have already said that women participate and perpetuate patriarchal norms. _Cosmetic surgery? Male dominated but I dont see many women entering to be plastic surgeons_Okay. So then which demographic would financially benefit from societal norms that pressure women to get multiple plastic surgeries to fit or attain the beauty standard. Could it be the plastic surgeons who tend to predominantly be men?Could it be that a society (of men and women!) that places significant value on a womans looks (particularly looking young) and that devalues older women and older looking women could potentially factor into why women have so much plastic surgery? Like I said - patriarchal norms and systems are not the same thing as men as a demographic.","title":"CMV: Men are not responsible for the rise in plastic surgery and unrealistic beauty standards"},{"text":"You're missing the point. This isn't about Republicans. Everybody knows they worship Trump and will excuse all the horrible things he says and does. That has never changed.Just think about how the media itself (KC in this case) judged the Democrat candidates vs Trump this entire election cycle. With Biden as the candidate, the ENTIRE narrative of the election was that both candidates were too old and clearly declining mentally. Then Biden withdrew and Kamala became the candidate...and the age narrative disappeared entirely. Did Trump all the sudden become young? LolWhich brings me back to my entire original point, the standards are so obviously different. And this goes WELL beyond Republicans and their cult-like devotion to Trump. Just shrugging your shoulders and saying \\"Republicans love Trump\\" gives a ridiculous free pass to people in the media (like in this case) who absolutely know better and continue to fail to meet the moment.The quote from Trump I posted above was largely ignored by every major media outlet. Of course FOX News and RW publications are going to ignore it but that's not who we're talking about here.If Harris had said what Trump said above, it would have been the biggest story on every news outlet. It would have effectively ended her campaign. Because the rules are different for each candidate. And we can't blame it all on MAGA.","title":"Katie Couric rips Kamala Harris for word salad responses in campaign interviews: 'Answer the godd--- question' - The former 'Today' host said she was 'frustrated' by Harris' 'inability' to succinctly answer questions - 'People notice that'"},{"text":"Do you think the death penalty is correct even if we put an innocent man to death?The same logic applies here.

Now, the Democratic Party does not directly support workers, so voters feel that both parties are the same. Now that immigrant voters feel both parties are the same, because the Democrats are not directly helping immigrants economically, Republicans have an advantage because culturally, immigrants agree with the Republicans on social issues. We, as Democrats need to change to focus heavily on economic issues and ignore campaigning on social issues but work on social issues behind the scenes.","title":"Hard truth"},{"text":"I'm sick of this Twitter account.

With that being said; there is a trend as you've described where women both get to say they're doing all of this for themselves when it suits them, and also get to blame men for increasing beauty standards when it suits them.The truth is always going to be a lot more complicated, nuanced, and middle of the road than these simple black and white statements. It is true that women dress up and wear makeup and such for themselves, for their own ego, and it's ALSO true that men are essentially validating the top of the top of women moreso than women who are middle of the range of beauty, which invariably exacerbates beauty standards. Men and women contribute to it equally in that sense, but where there is a mismatch it is which gender shames the other more for not meeting these standards. Just as it is the case that men shame other men more than women shame men for not meeting standards; so too is the corollary. Women shame other women FAR more than men shame women, which goes against the conclusion that men are primarily to blame here.So you're correct, men are not at fault for women's mental health issues relating to appearance. However, that doesn't mean that they can be ignored by us. I'm sick of people (not saying you, OP) looking at this like it's a race to the bottom and misery begetting yet more misery, women have systemic issues relating to mental health and so do men, segregating and pointing fingers is not helpful. It is in fact, as counter productive as you could possibly be - to become insular and surround yourself in an echo chamber that repeats detrimental lies that corrupts society and ruins lives.And that's essentially what has happened, our media circles are so insular that most people aren't even aware of the other sides ills. And if they are, it's because they're the ones being blamed for it. We're made aware of it simply because of the fact that it drives engagement and stokes the flames of the gender war. Why are there sides to begin with? Something inside the human spirit which likes to categorize and differentiate (a good thing) has made alien and evil (a bad thing) a convenient scape goat to push all of our failings and misfortune onto.Politics is division by definition, and the personal is political. But that doesn't mean that we can or should divide ourselves for the sake of blaming others outside of our category.

Im saying such discoveries are not valuable in and of themselves.

It also drove increased investment into extractable resources and has led to prolonged interest in science. But at this point returns you get from every new piece of info you learn have diminished significantly as they no longer are the primarily drivers of these ends. Dinosaur knowledge is so vast now that to a casual you could influence to be interested in science more broadly, theyll never exhaust the existing knowledge base. Extractable resources dont need any further encouragement to come out of the ground. The only value I can see in it now (which Ive been convinced from this thread) is someone supporting research into dinosaurs might make a discovery that has ancillary benefits to more important areas of scientific research and it therefore had value to that end.

Youre going to have to justify declaring that correlation as a causation. It has to do with the gifts and comfort they get from dating a wealthy man. Because that benefit still exists.

Many of them were arrested and deported for the exact reasons you said above. Fast forward a few years. Thousands of deported gang members are back in El Salvador after the war ended, except you cant arrest someone for a crime they committed in another country, so these dangerous criminals were set free into the country. The gang problem was rampant  El Salvador had the highest homicide rate in the world at 105/100,000 in 2015, and over 70% of all of the countrys businesses were being extorted. Now they have a dictator who was elected after running on a gang crackdown. It worked because of mass arbitrary arrests, mass imprisonment, and an ongoing 2-year state of exception that suspends certain civil rights like the right to an attorney and the right to a fair trial. They are trying accused gang members in groups of up to 900. Prisons are at 200% capacity and innocent people are dying. He also just staged a self-coup and changed the constitution to stay in power.

I don't know what to tell you, maybe you just don't talk to many women? because I don't know any women who have never once expressed frustration at this overall idea.?\\nWhat about wealthy romantic or powerful men? They are often written in romance novels, are they not? I mean, obviously women are going to be primarily a subject of standards set by men, as society is going to be predominantly heterosexual or bisexual, because sexual reproduction\\nyeah that's actually a great example, the whole \\"being whisked away by a wealthy man and taken care of\\" trope comes explicitly from the fact that back then, women were not seeing much money if there wasn't a man attached to it. this is part of the fantasy, a fantasy borne of the fact that without a husband, women has nothing.\\nBut men are also generally going to strive to fit womens expectations and standards.

But women also like writing sexy, romantic men. Its just, the authors hormones affecting their writing. That is it.?\\nbut look at HOW they're sexualized though, surely youve noticed that the ways men find women sexy are very different to the ways women find men sexy. a lot of sexualized women tend to be smaller, demure, coquettish and willing, no, eager to please you big boy. a loooooot of women are made sexy to men by being portrayed as weak objects who want to serve men.?\\na lot of men are made sexy to women by being portrayed as strong, caring types who want to protect them and I think that says a lot about the different ways society views female and male sexuality.","title":"CMV: Men are not responsible for the rise in plastic surgery and unrealistic beauty standards"},{"text":"It's an escape for personal responsibility and introspection for them.

Also I cant help but feel the pursuit of knowledge and technology in real terms is what has actually lead to the existential threat posed by climate change and advances in weaponry continuously throughout history lead to more and more death, destruction, and destabilisation. Atomic weaponry has created a constant global security risk. Plastics have lead to biodiversity degradation and immensely negative health effects, and chemical engineering has lead to commercialised obesity or the development of cigarettes that are more chemically addictive. Obviously Ive just cherry picked the bad stuff - but in many of these cases wed have been better as a race in harmony with the planet to have steered clear of these discoveries even if that meant that the compounding nature of technological advancement was forcibly constrained as a concept. Also I dont necessarily think primitive, unscientific cultures were worse off, they just didnt, and dont equate the idea of prosperity with technological advancement which many believe is a fallacy. Ive mentioned it a few times but I think in Gullivers travels, the Laputans are a good example of why the premise is silly - and the process of discovery and the acquisition of knowledge, and then the application of knowledge can be cruel, positive, ridiculous or irrelevant - the value comes from what is done with the info.","title":"CMV: At this point, there is no value in studying dinosaurs any further"},{"text":"Makes sense.

Self determination - the right to make one's own choices and control one's own life and body. Many states are legislating away access to transition and even going so far as to put bounties on our heads just for leaving our homes in our own clothes. Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.2. Access to timely and appropriate medical care - the right to get transition care to treat gender dysphoria caused by gender incongruence *when* it is needed without delay or discrimination. If cis girls can get boob jobs and hormones (birth control is just hormone therapy by a different name and with different goals but the treatments are largely still hormonal) at 14 then equal protection and equality under the law should ensure that trans girls can also get those things. That it not currently the case. This right is already not extended to trans teens. This impacts our rights to Life and Liberty as trans healthcare is lifesaving with some interventions (puberty blockers and hormones) having a 300% reduction in distress and transition having the lowest regret rate (&lt;1%) out of any contemporary medical intervention. Pursuit of happiness is hindered here too.3. Equal participation and protection under the law. We're being banned from sports leagues (even chess, so it's not about \\"fairness\\", it's just about kicking us out of society) and bathrooms, and it's still legal to fire someone or deny service or housing for being trans (trans people are born trans). And Republicans are trying to make discrimination the norm. This one affects all four of the tenets of freedom listed above but  Equality is hindered the most.4. Freedom of expression and freedom from forced speech. Putting the wrong sex on someone's legal documents counts as forced speech.  Banning trans women from public spaces if we wear \\"women's clothing\\" is policing free expression. Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.5. Right to emergency care - some states (Florida, Arkansas) have made it so paramedics can refuse to treat or transport someone on the basis of them being trans. Right to life is obviously harmed here.6. Freedom from cruel and unusual punishments - trans women in particular are sent to prison due to disproportionate policing of our bodies and our marginalization that leads a large number of us into sex work which criminalizes us. Then they are sent to men's  prison and those same trans women who have only committed petty crimes to survive are v-coded and turned into sex slaves for the violent inmates there while simultaneously being denied medically necessary healthcare. That's incredibly cruel and unusual punishment.I could keep going btw. Trans people are at best 4th class citezens in this country.","title":"Protesters descend on Democratic congressman's office over transgender comments"},{"text":"We could have had Katie Porter.Thanks California.

I always felt that way about Hillary Clinton, Couric said. If you are giving them these almost weird, like, amorphous softballs, its really hard to kind of hone your message and be succinct and say what you really need to say.I also felt that, and again, I think [Harris] really did well in so many areas, but I was frustrated by her inability to really succinctly answer questions at times, Jen, Couric continued.Like, if she was asked about changing the Supreme Court at that CNN town hall, she had an opportunity to talk about ethics and what, you know, [Supreme Court Justices Samuel] Alito and Clarence Thomas were doing, and she answered, like, in one sentence, and then went on to something that had nothing to do with the question, Couric said. You know, people notice that, and its like, Answer the g-ddn question, please!?She then pivoted to Harris now-infamous comments on The View where she was asked about what she would do differently from President Biden, calling it one of the most damaging things.Ok, Jen, youre an insider. Why didnt Joe Biden say, Listen, I know youre going to have to separate yourself from this administration. Lets talk about areas where you can, where theyre legitimate, and God speed, Couric wondered. Because it- I think somebody wrote that it was almost as if they were more afraid of hurting Joe Bidens feelings than winning the election.?Psaki, who served as Bidens White House press secretary before joining MSNBC, responded by saying it was a unique and painful summer for Biden and that there was a fragility about him being sidelined by the Democratic Party. She also pointed out that Biden was beloved by the party when he stepped aside and that Harris had navigated the politics of that in a very tricky way.It seems to me, if I were running for president, Jen, I would sit down with my brain trust, and Id be like, Okay, lets play out these questions. What am I gonna say? Couric said.?And I would have had a template that I would have carried around with me in every interview, and I would have reviewed them and said, you know, This is what I believe, and this is how Im going to handle a question like that. Now, why didnt they- it just didnt seem like that was done. Am I crazy? she wondered.Couric also knocked the vice president for going several weeks without doing any interviews when she first emerged as the Democratic nominee, saying it was making me crazy as a consumer.What was that? the former Today host asked.\\nI dont know, Psaki responded before speculating that the Harris campaign was prepping for the debate.?She shouldve been everywhere, Couric later added.","title":"Katie Couric rips Kamala Harris for word salad responses in campaign interviews: 'Answer the godd--- question' - The former 'Today' host said she was 'frustrated' by Harris' 'inability' to succinctly answer questions - 'People notice that'"},{"text":"Fuck Russia and I pray that nukes never fly.","title":"Putin lowers the threshold for using his nuclear arsenal after Bidens arms decision for Ukraine"},{"text":"Progressive educated elites pay massive premiums to buy into an entire segregated society built using aggressive anti-poor zoning that keeps the black underclass out of their suburbs.

Im not Palaeontologist (obviously) but I did talk to my friend who is a geologist and a huge Dino nerd and another geologist in a previous thread and between them they said the biggest recent discoveries in the field of palaeontology were aiding the discovery of fossil fuel resources (which you could argue is bad), aiding the development of fossil/bone imaging machines and 3D modelling programming (useful), further info on the KT extinction event and its impact on biodiversity (which is actually more related to the broader field of palaeontology and not specifically dinosaurs) and the discovery that dinosaurs engaged in herding behaviours (useful to challenging prevailing notions of repitlian behaviours). Out of those discoveries only the last one I think is even remotely relevant to commercial interests argument (you can sell family toy packs, and the land before time can have a more humanised cast of characters), and Id still posit that the commercial entertainment industry around dinosaurs would be fine if scientists from this point on never made another discovery in the field. I mean theyre giant monsters in the eyes of children and retain a quasi-mythological quality about them to adults. Without additional information they will remain saleable as a toys or as features in entertainment products just based on their inherent allure. This isnt being buoyed by continuous research.

I mean, if we would need to choose one then it's a no brainer, but since we can have both and since we don't know for sure what we will find until we start researching, why not have both? Again, it's not like dino people would suddenly start to research water treatment. It's the same as saying some health/medical areas deserves more funding.

That's not what this is - this is an observation of the right's messaging strategy and how they took something that affects so few people like youth sports and ramped it up over time.At first, it was trans girls in cis girls' sports. A couple quotes from this [article](https://www.newsweek.com/how-many-transgender-athletes-play-womens-sports-1796006) last year: *\\"Save Women's Sports, an organization advocating for banning transgender athletes from competing in girls' sports, identified only five transgender athletes competing on girls' teams in school sports for grades K through 12.\\"**\\"\\"While we don't know the exact number of trans women competing in NCAA sports, I would be very surprised if there were more than 100 of them in the women's category,\\" Harper told Newsweek.\\"*You're telling me that every Republican running these ads nonstop about how their opponent wants \\"men playing in girls' sports\\" was actually them honestly concerned about the small handful of people this affects? No, of course they didn't care. But it opened up the door for people who might not have otherwise cared one way or the other about trans issues. We saw how this was beginning to take effect during the Olympics, when a cisgender woman was (and still is) accused of being a trans woman. Once the lie takes shape and spreads, it's nearly impossible to stop.The messaging became more extreme - now they're giving your kids gender affirming care behind your back and forcing sex change operations on them. It didn't matter if people believed it or not, the thought was in their head.  Now, we're heading into the next four years with an administration who posted their playbook that shows exactly how trans protections will be eliminated. But in order to get people on board with this last part, they needed to reel them in with sports.","title":"Protesters descend on Democratic congressman's office over transgender comments"},{"text":"Why?

I think you underestimate how much of beauty standards are influenced by men. For example, men often say they like a natural look instead of heavy makeup, but in practice this means they favour women who wear a natural makeup look as opposed to no makeup. Similarly many men criticise plastic surgery, but they also criticise women for looking old which drives women to plastic surgery. Other beauty standards are even more obviously supported by men e.g. being slim, hairless, big boobs &amp; butt etc. I don't know if you have been around teenage boys any time recently but they absolutely do insult women &amp; girls' looks if they don't conform to their idea of sex appeal.","title":"CMV: Men are not responsible for the rise in plastic surgery and unrealistic beauty standards"},{"text":"Women often say they do these things to feel confident.

It shows that we are fickle and depending on the election year you may/may not be able to rely on Western support. With this in mind, the green light has been given to give Zelensky the chance to put Putin in a bind and perhaps even make a peaceful resolution insurmountable. Russia is living on borrowed time. Their economic system is in full war-economy status. Every single production plant that Zelensky can hit destroys not only a little more military output, but also hits the Russian economy hard as well. With these missiles and NATO intelligence I can easily see entire supply lines disrupted. Russia would have to move supply depots so far away from the actual combat zones that it could inhibit their activities of the entire war zone. Time is actively working against the Russian state. The longer, and more expensive this war becomes, the greater chance we have of seeing a full collapse of the Russian economy. Add to all of this you have the EU powers actively prepping for the shift in US policy as well, essentially as a guarantee that these level of weapons will continue flowing into Ukraine, regardless of anything that Trump does.

How can utility not play a role in research. Your saying to discriminate based on subjectivity is some sort of illogical/untenable limitation, but subjectives perceptions of value come into research all the time. For example the entire field of research ethics, medical ethics. These are based on subjective values. So why then should subjective perceptions of value not also mould research? To take an example from Gullivers travels should we research whether marble can be softened for pillows, or should be instead allocate resources toward ecological restoration? Perceptions of value obviously will lead any rational person to conclude that latter is more important. Therefore subjective assessments obviously play a role and to deny this point is absurd.Also, closure for closures sake, has no collective utility. Proving something right, where it is inconsequential, is not something I would consider being of collective utility. Its intellectually enriching for an individual, but doesnt impact anything. They were right because evolutionary biology already suggested that, confirming it didnt impact the broader scientific communities belief in evolution, it just gave people a trivial tidbit on featured velociraptors. Ill concede that I was talking out of turn when I said studying dead animals was useless. I was being inflammatory and baity. I should have been more specific in relation to the premise. The argument about the opportunity cost I was more making in terms of the ancillary gains other fields have that come from the study of palaeontology. Ill also concede that was a point poorly made because I was talking about it being interdisciplinary where I shouldve actually said more about the intra-disciplinary expertise: e.g., having a sub-specialty in dinosaur behaviours and skeletal expertise is completely different clipped in value (as I perceive there to be value) by other palaeontologists who study the more useful aspects of the field like historical climate figures and biodiversity - essentially where the collective utility lies is in their relation to information which has the potential to actual be practice to pressing issues in human society, not fun Dino trivia. I think on a lot of the points Im not convinced by you here on, youre right in that they stem from my ideological beliefs. I think if my starting point is that it is possible to ascribe value to research areas, based on my own subjective interpretation of value (which in my mind makes rational sense), then Im not going to agree. The argument that actually got me in this thread was just that there is potential that during a research project on dinosaurs someone might make an important ancillary discovery to a research area I think is of greater importance. I would still hold though that if new information of the dinosaur was also found during that project, it is of no value in of itself: its value is its power to compel more research which has the potential to make more ancillary discoveries on more important areas.

I have 2 separate thoughts on this. The 1st is that many men will *say* they prefer natural, but their IG following (or the women theyre lusting over) paints a different story. Men can say thats just visual, I prefer natural for a relationship! but many women prefer to be both. They want to be the woman youd wife up and ALSO the woman youre salivating over. Many stories of women saying their bf is neglecting sex with them to jerk off to heavily edited IG models. The 2nd is, when men say they want natural theyre often picturing a woman who is naturally conventionally beautiful. Who doesnt NEED makeup/surgeries, and just naturally has conventional markers of beauty. All the fake stuff - makeup, surgeries, extensions, etc wasnt meant to look as sloppy as it does now. It was meant to help women who didnt naturally fit conventional beauty standards, and supposed to look natural. Which is why I roll my eyes a bit cause its like yeah, you dont want a woman who wears makeup. You just want her to naturally have glowing skin. You dont want her to wear extensions. You just want her to naturally have long, healthy hair. You dont want a surgery you just want her to naturally have a hourglass figure.Many women cannot be conventionally attractive without some (or in some cases, a lot) of the fake stuff. When I dont wear natural makeup, Im told I look tired. When I dress up and go out, I get approached and complimented way more by both men and women.Women will often notice the difference in levels of attention, and act accordingly. What people say isnt as relevant as what they actually do.","title":"CMV: Men are not responsible for the rise in plastic surgery and unrealistic beauty standards"},{"text":"So to say men are solely responsible is incorrect. Things in society are rarely that simple. Capitalism, feminism, beauty standards amongst sexes, any number of things could be the cause.

My own guess is that social media is a big driving force.

Although I voted for it, the bill failed by a vote of 256 to 145.\\n \\nThose who voted against it mainly focused on the section of the bill dealing with organizations supporting terrorist groups.

What makes a degree useless is, I guess, a matter of opinion. I myself went to a small liberal arts college. I only remember two art history majors, and they both became art history professors and turned out pretty well, so  what? We shouldnt have art history professors? I certainly disagree with you if thats what youre suggesting. As for the rest of us, there are some other professors, yes, but most of us leveraged those degrees into successful careers in other fields. Ill use my own career as an example. I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in chemistry. I was a research chemist for just two years (one of my coworkers eventually became the CEO of Gilead Sciences), then went to law school, practiced for 33 years, helped a lot of people with their legal problems, was President of my state bar, was given several prestigious awards, was very happy and satisfied, retired at the age of 60, and am still living my best life as I always have. So you can call my liberal arts degree useless if you like, but my experience tells me otherwise. Steve Jobs went to my school too. Hes considered an alumnus even though he didnt graduate. (From anywhere; he had no degrees.)Federal funding: Oklahoma has 4 million people and Massachusetts has seven. The per capita for Massachusetts is higher, probably because they elect representatives in Congress who work to make that happen.

Beauty standards are perpetuated by patriarchy and capitalism (which is inherently patriarchal) and affect all of us. No one is saying that men are solely to blame for unrealistic beauty standards, it is societal.Secondly, saying men prefer a natural look means absolutely nothing. A woman can have fillers, lash extensions, plastic surgery, hair extensions and a tinted moisturiser and men would still say they look natural. The natural look to men means the appearance of not wearing makeup while still being in line with conventional beauty standards, which in the era of social media and a society obsessed with porn, nearly always means having work done. If anything, men insisting that they prefer a more natural look may lead to more women seeking cosmetic procedures to enhance their natural features, e.g. instead of using obvious makeup like lip liner and lipstick to make lips look larger, they might opt for fillers instead. Men dont know what natural women look like anymore and I do think thats in part due to social media and porn. Thirdly, and I believe this may be a more controversial viewpoint. But liberal and choice feminism does often play into misogynistic or patriarchal values while saying its my choice or Im doing it for myself. This approach ignores the role of patriarchy in womens choices. Patriarchy tells women that we lose value as we age, we are invisible once we a) cant have children or b) are no longer desirable to men. Realistically, if there wasnt so much pressure to look young and attractive, how many women (and men to be fair) would choose to have risky surgeries, have toxins injected into their faces, or invest in beauty routines that are incredibly expensive and time consuming.I dont really think there is a narrative that men are entirely to blame for womens beauty standards.

Their friends dare them to do some stupid prank that they don't know the laws around (such as graffiti in the wrong area). They get caught. The rest of the friends are ordered by the city to pay for the replacement paint job. But the undocumented one gets a much more severe punishment than any other teenager: they are banished to a country they don't even remember and have to start life from scratch alone.Most Americans have done something illegal, whether it's trespassing, trying some sort of drug or alcohol before the proper age, or something similar.

And why should it be? If you are an undocumented immigrant in the US, why would you ever want attention brought on to yourself to get deported, when you worked so hard to find a way into the country and escape wherever it is you fled from? That's why between 1990 and 2018, nearly 90% of incarcerations for immigrants were related to immigration violation laws.My issue with Trump's war on immigrants is very simply that the numbers aren't there to warrant the scale of his war, for one. For two, because of the nature of undocumented immigrants, being that they are not accounted for in the US system and therefore cannot be precisely tracked, many legal immigrants and US citizens will be caught in the crossfire, should Trump enact this Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Think back to the Haitans of Springfield: Trump has repeated wrongfully that they are eating animals and committing crimes in the city. Haitan immigrants in Springfield could very well be targeted by his anti-immigration policies, even though they are in the country legally, and theres nothing they can do about it. It would be one of the most Orwellian events of our lifetime.And if you think it's absolutely not possible that citizens could be targeted, [George Takei, a US citizen, recounted that his family, who were legal US citizens during the Second World War, were detained with other Japanese immigrants, because they were at war with Japan.](https://search.app?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2Felections%2F2024%2F11%2F03%2Fgeorge-takei-worries-trump-repeat-dark-past%2F75828007007%2F&amp;utm_campaign=aga&amp;utm_source=agsadl1%2Cagsadl3%2Csh%2Fx%2Fgs%2Fm2%2F4) That's the level of overreach we would be dealing with.

Mankind will face challenges, and the study of these fossils could unlock some answers.Another thing to consider is that we simply arent finished learning about them.

That I believe does have value as it informs on other scientific areas like you mentioned.

There was no additional value in that discovery. If we learned no new facts about dinosaur behaviours and biology - theres no impact. This is directly contrasted to cosmology, as that is a technically progressive science. Knowing more about dead animals is not changing anything.Also just because it is gatekeepy doesnt mean the point is not valid because it doesnt negate the argument against utility. Knowing more Dino facts than we already do at the moment is overkill. The rest of what you said trails off into nihilism - but there is from a humanist or even just generally logical perspective - scientific research which is pursued in the hope that it might have a utility in progressing technology, or helping aid an existing issue, is valuable. Research into agriculture is essential for things like crop resilience so people can EAT, or medical research so people can live, or studying biodiversity so environments can be recovered.

There's no consistency in it and, to my eye, it really just depends on whether popular beauty trends appeal to academics.

Nearly every female celebrity who is a symbol of sex and/or beauty has had a nose job, a brow lift, lip fillers. People assume all plastic surgery looks like the pinched noses, balloon boobs of the 80s. Like the hyper edited insta models. But so many \\"natural\\" instagram models with huge male followings get treatments, and edit their photos and videos. Hell, men are the main consumers of pornographic content and many models, yes even natural looking ones, will have had some kind of treatment. And all of them wear makeup. Most plastic surgery is unnoticeable unless you're a plastic surgeon yourself or know a lot about it.   \\nWomen usually spend more time reading about plastic surgery, they're more keenly eyed to edited photos and what a natural woman looks like- because they are a natural woman. Because we know what makeup, botox, lip fillers look like. I remember once in conversation with my boyfriend's sister when she revealed she had gotten lip filler a couple times. I already knew that because I've looked into it, and know what even natural filler looks like. My boyfriend? He had no clue and was surprised.

Not that these men actually care about beauty, but seek profits over all else, even if that means shaming women into buying their products.

And am training simultaneously as a clinician and a researcher. First and foremost, I think your support for someone whose rhetoric is as dangerous as RFKs is disappointing. Measles cases have exploded in various communities because of our refusal to quell the rising childhood vaccine skeptics who dont understand basic concepts of public health. With that being said, the same way you want to work with him, I would like to try to inform and work with you. I will start with your second point. The big problem with forgoing the trial system and offering drugs that are safe is that to understand efficacy takes time and careful controls. Safety studies dont provide efficacy data because they arent designed to do so. Patients enrolled are often different than those on an efficacy study. With that being said 1b/2a trials often do exactly what you are asking. The sad truth is while there are a few examples where accelerating a drug to market may have helped a few people, the vast majority of cases would be dangerous and do far more harm than good. We already have different FDA uses. Compassionate, fast-track, morality clauses in phase 3 trials that end when its clear efficacy is being achieved and results in switching all patients on to the best treatment. Even grayer areas where drugs are allowed to be used off-label because theres evidence but not sufficient funding for phase 3. This is true in many rare diseases. Part of the reason for conducting these studies as meticulous as they are is that now patients have all sorts of drugs. Clinicians/pharmacists simply arent going to be able to navigate a world where a patented compound has passed safety approval in 6-12 people and is now on the market. Moreover what if these compounds are offered and marketed on TV before the advertising loophole is closed? The medical system could quickly disintegrate into the Wild West. I can assure you as the field gets more and more complicated with more and more drugs and people living longer the last thing we need is increasing distrust in medical providers. To your first point, Americans arent usually paying that much more. I have a prescription that is 600 dollars a month. But I pay 10 dollars. Its vastly based on the insurance model we have. I totally agree the government needs to be able to do some level of negotiating on pricing. I totally agree that drugs should cost less. But the idea that the cost is being passed on to the average American is really only true if that persons insurance is bad or non-existent. The entire system needs an overhaul, but to do so would be tricky and painful. The money in healthcare has been a rising tide. Nicer hospitals. Better doctors. The best research. But yes, that tide has also left people drowning. Its unclear to me if the best way to help these people is to lower the tide or another creative solution Like that time we almost required healthcare the point being its simple to say lower the price! Its much more complicated in reality.3. Totally agree. Though Ads dont need to be banned necessarily but should be capped at a small percentage of revenue from the drug. So the drug has to be popular/useful before its even advertised rather than the other way around. I sincerely hope that you (continue to) speak to medical professionals and experts on this subject before enacting any policy. And I hope that in your desire to implement changes, you do not lose sight of some of the actors you would like to work with like RFK Jr, and the dangers they pose.","title":"Neolibs gonna shill, shill, shill, shill, Shkrel..."},{"text":"Huh\\nAll countries are present, see herehttps://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202411/g20-leaders-photo-195949796-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=TRyi.zw0Q9UceyD.bhwKY.plq.8MB.25&amp;size=690:388\\nStop being weird.","title":"Video Does Not Show Biden Wandering Off into Amazon Rainforest"},{"text":"I really wanted that to be a debate question.

If a woman goes out in college pants and a baggy sweater, I do think they're gonna get negative comments both from men and from women.If a woman goes out without makeup, I think they'll be perceived more negatively by men as opposed to women. But I do not think that it'll be explicit, because I don't think most men even know who's wearing makeup and who's not. It is a VERY common thing that people like a natural looking woman who's not wearing makeup.... except that they're wearing full makeup, the men just didn't realize it. Whereas then the woman not wearing makeup is simply seen as someone who's unattractive.And finally, the plastic surgery. This is a bit of a niche group of people to begin with, I find. Most people simply don't get plastic surgeries. Nevertheless, I think this is where the unrealistic standards are increasingly set by men, although - again - indirectly. I don't think men go around telling women - or even thinking it to themselves in secret - wow, you're not much to look at but if you had a plastic surgery you'd be gorgeous. But I do think that especially when a woman gets older, they often simply find let's say a 40-year-old woman with some plastic surgery more likely to be attractive than the same 40-year-old without a plastic surgery. Yes, in a survey thy might say that they prefer natural women, and they might even for real prefer natural women. They just don't prefer the less attractive natural women if you compared them to the attractive natural women, and this then turns into unrealistic beauty standards.So, in short, I think women are equally responsible for some of the unrealistic beauty standards too, but I think men - often unknowingly - contribute to them more in certain areas. This probably becomes amplified when we talk about celebrities and actresses, which is a world of its own, but also something that controls a lot of the media space, and therefore occupies peoples' minds more than it should.","title":"CMV: Men are not responsible for the rise in plastic surgery and unrealistic beauty standards"},{"text":"Thats right.

These are their spouses, partners, friends, parents, sisters, kids, etc etc. Like we all live in a society, we are all one humanity, blah blah blah, we all influence and affect eachother,? I think everyone is kinda to blame here.?\\nI have not personally seen an argument or idea persist in the first place that men alone are responsible for unrealistic beauty standards also. Can you establish any evidence that that's a thing people say? It can even just be another reddit post or anything, just something showing someone saying that. I'm curious.?I think we can all agree a huge thing responsible for the rise in plastic surgery and unrealistic beauty standards is social media, and things like advertising makeup, where they push on girls from a young age to be self conscious about their looks, and try to make girls/women feel ugly and insecure so they will want to buy their products and then look better. A lot of it is stemming from people wanting to make money. They push women to feel insecure so they will pay to improve their looks. Realistically, the peopoe behind that will include men, probably more men than women (men are more likely to he in high up positions).\\nAs far as when women way \\"we do it for ourselves\\" regarding clothes and makeup, it's usually in response to an accusation that they only do it for men, and being told they need to stop and cover themselves up (clothing wise) or not wear makeup. You'll see people who say women are doing something wrong if they wear it on a first date. People who say women deserve to be harassed if they aren't covered up enough. It's not a real deep conversation where everyone is opening up and sharing their true feelings about why they wear makeup (I'm just going to use that as an example) It's basically saying I can dress however I want and wear whatever I want, fuck off.?\\nWhile if you go to a space where it's mostly women talking, and where it's more of a comfortable conversation where they don't feel attacked for wearing makeup and aren't on the defense, the conversation happens different. There are plenty of women who enjoy makeup for fine reasons and it's not anything bad or unhealthy, I'm not trying to say all makeup is bad, but there are people who wear it due to insecurities.?\\nFor example if a woman made a post in a female geared sub that she feels so insecure about herself, and she just can't leave the house without putting on makeup, she might mention men within that, and other people who feel the same way might mention men too. I've seen that. I'm sure you could see it happening that way.?\\nYes there are people who just use makeup in a healthy way, and even those people might get all dolled up for a date with their husband/bf and put on makeup. Once you are broaching the topic of women who wear it for unhealthy reasons, due to deep insecurities about themselves, to act like men are never going to be apart of that, and that they only feel judged by other women, and zero % by men, and aren't worried about impressing men or how men think about them, seems unrealistic. The vast majority of women are straight and are attracted to men, and it's really painful and upsetting if you feel like you're looked at as ugly by the opposite gender. The same can be said for men who feel ugly btw even if that's not the topic now. To act like people don't get treated differently based off their looks is just a blatant lie. Men treat people better if they look better, women do as well, everyone takes part in it unfortunately.?We don't exist in a vacuum away from eachother.?\\nI was using makeup as one example, ofc other things you mentioned can apply here as well and it's not just makeup.?\\nAs far as statistics, I don't know any offhand and I'm too lazy to look them up tbh, but if you bring up statistics and you want to use that as a real point, you need actual studies, sources. And the burden of evidence is on you here cause it's your argument and you're the one saying you have hard numbers to back it up. So where are they? Not trying to be harsh about it, but without actually bringing specific statistics up it's a moot point.?\\nLike you say that women cause more pressure than men to conform to beauty standards, that men never induce that pressure, and that men prefer women who are \\"natural.\\" Those are a lot of big claims without any evidence. It's impossible to argue against anecdotal evidence. Anecdotal evidence isn't an argument that we can discuss, it's just your personal experiences. I can't tell you that your personal experienced that you are saying happened, didn't happen. It doesn't really mean anything though, other than that it's an anecdotal story. So it's a moot point as well to bring up here cause it doesn't really say anything.?\\nLast thing, you mentioned men say they don't like how surgery looks, but the ones where you can tell they had surgery are botched jobs that are badly done. If surgery is done well, you have no clue unless you knew the person before and saw what they previously looked like.?","title":"CMV: Men are not responsible for the rise in plastic surgery and unrealistic beauty standards"},{"text":"With a google search you can find that 54% of Americans are functionally illiterate.

Men cant reliably tell if a woman is wearing subtle makeup or has had tasteful cosmetic surgery. Guys dont like hyper-sexualized and over the top makeup and cosmetic surgery, but thats generally quite quite rare. When men are presented with images of the same woman with and without makeup, they reliably choose makeup. And when presented with images of women before and after theyve undergone cosmetic surgery, men reliably prefer whichever image is closer to societally ideal facial structures or hip-waist ratios [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.2147/CCID.S410621#abstract). Men say they dont like plastic surgery and makeup because they have absolutely no clue what most plastic surgery and makeup looks like, and when presented with examples rather than abstract questions, men reliably prefer women that most closely conform to cultural standards.Also, there are no societal pressures independent of male opinions. They make up half the population and the vast majority of corporate leadership and ownership in cosmetics, fashion, media, and marketing. Weve had decades upon decades of media created and controlled primarily by men, and popular media is one of the biggest driving forces behind cultural expectations.Of course women play a role in this too. Of course social media influencers photoshopping pictures of themselves to have thinner waists and bigger breasts has a negative impact on the body image of women everywhere. But we live in a capitalist society; profit is the driving force behind media, creating media that promotes unrealistic beauty standards is massively profitable, and its primarily men that control media.","title":"CMV: Men are not responsible for the rise in plastic surgery and unrealistic beauty standards"},{"text":"Disappointed in Schiff?

The lesson to take from this is how insidious it is. It's unfortunate that we weren't taught in school that the Nazis most powerful weapon was not their military. It was not their science and engineering.

The rust belt didnt just decline because of globalization or bad weather, it declined because industry will go where things are cheaper to make. A lot of southern states that still have large manufacturing sectors dont necessarily have the luxury of hoping that raising costs on those firms will keep jobs in America.?Second: tariffs. Tariffs weaken exports by making them more expensive, and they make imports more expensive. But they also frequently boost domestic manufacturing, by making up some of the difference between foreign and domestic labor costs in taxes. If you work a well-paid service sector job, thats obviously not worth it. But if you have a more blue collar job, the injection of cash into local labor could be good for you.?Third: the Democratic Party at some point has to run on its record, not its goals. The democrats have had power for the last four years. What can they realistically claim they did for the common man? Did they fight to raise the minimum wage? No. Did they fight for drug reform? Also no. Did they fight to reduce gaps in social insurance? Also no. The last substantial improvement for common people made by a democratic federal politician (not the court) that they can claim is probably Obamacare, which is almost 15 years ago now.?Forth: the Democratic Party has open contempt for working class America. How many times have you heard Donald Trumps I love the poorly educated played for laughs among liberals? Basket of deplorables went viral and was said by a presidential candidate.

Would you really trust a group like that to take care of the working class, especially outside of the coasts??I still voted for the Democratic Party.

If we use the 4% benchmark that extends the timeline to April 2021 until May 2023. That was not 36months or more and I have no idea what you're talking about with that figure. When talking about \\"over target\\" what do you mean? If using the 2% mark then I have news for you...most of US history has been over target. Even if we just look at 1983-2008, the Great Moderation through to the GFC the average rate was 2.9% with routine spikes and period of ~4% and even over 5% at times. Since May 2023 we've seen monthly inflation entirely in line with the historical average in that period between the GM and GFC and the 2024 estimate would be around the median for that period.The problem is twofold. First is that even if inflation was between 0% for the past 18months the price level would still be higher and people would be upset about that. Prices would have still been around 16% higher than they were in Q1 of 2021. Second is that people got very used to the ultra low inflation and interest rates of the the 21st century, particularly the post GFC where rates were near 0 for almost a decade *and* inflation was under 2% with brief periods of deflation. The 90s are often thought of as a great economy. During that period inflation averaged 3% and the federal funds rate spent years higher than what we saw post in 2023. Cheap credit subsidized *a lot* of things people liked in the 21st century, basically all the tech companies that could afford to not turn a profit because investors could borrow for near free. This was not the norm and is unlikely to be in the future.\\nFurther people who talk about Manchin and others inflation concerns in relation to the infrastructure bill are *really* bad at math. The 1.2 trillion bill only authorized 550billion in new spending...over *eight years*. That's about 80 billion extra per year. Even if we assumed the entirety of the 400billion that was allocated by November 2023 was spent (it wasn't and anyone in contracting or construction knows that) and assume the baseline spending was evenly spread out that is roughly 250billion over two years \\"spent\\" (again this was just allocated) or 125B extra per year. If you think 125B in an economy of 25 trillion is what causes 8% inflation then I really don't know what to tell you. Oh and recall the people like Manchin and Sinema opposed the revenue components too which would have taken a good chunk of that money out of the economy. Can't have it both ways where they were visionary for saying the spending would cause inflation while opposing the taxes that would be deflationary.\\nTL;DR: we didn't have 36+ months of inflation, it was transitory needing raised rates for a short period, and the extra spending over multi-year plans that Manchin opposed weren't the contributor. I can't believe people think 80B extra per year in 6.5 trillion of federal spending and a 27-28 trillion economy would cause the inflation we saw.","title":"How Joe Bidens Gamble on Inflation Backfired - WSJ"},{"text":"That was the ppp loan slush fund and I agree with you on that.

You can't get them to pay for their trip back because they have nothing, and they will do literally anything to survive in the country, including crime, because again - if they return, they will die, and if they starve, they also die.From a pragmatic standpoint, by doing nothing, the government is hoisting the cost of handling illegal immigrants on the communities themselves - they'll need to be fed and dressed, and it'll come from illegal jobs, charity, or crime. This is not ideal.Alternatively, the government can spend money to support illegal immigrants, try and deport them, or just shoot them on the spot; the third choice is decidedly cheaper and has the same effect as the second, while the first choice could be (but isn't necessarily) more expensive than the second.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"The FBI has been advising that the police and military are invested with white supremacists for decades.

You live in France, benefiting from its freedomsfreedom to dress how you please, freedom to protest, freedom to critiqueyet you frame its secular policies as \\"oppression\\" while championing a Saudi system that enforces mandatory dress codes and punishes deviation. Frances laws do not forbid you from practicing Islam; they enforce secularism in public institutions, applying equally to all faiths. Saudi Arabia, by contrast, mandates not only attire but behavior under theocratic law, stripping women of any choice in how they express themselves.Why havent you moved to Saudi Arabia, the supposed utopia of womens rights and Islamic governance, if you find Western secularism so oppressive? Could it be because the rights you enjoy in Franceeducation, unrestricted movement, and the ability to critique systemsdont exist under the Saudi regime?Is it truly \\"oppression\\" to ask for neutrality in public spaces, or is it more oppressive to jail women for unveiling their faces?--- **\\"Where do you think its better to live: in a country where youre free to live your religion or in a country where when you go out you have the fear to be spit on, insulted, harassed, killed because of your religion and where the media tries as much as they can to make you and your other religious folks the bad guy, as terrorists, as the problem of the world (just like Nazi Germany did)?\\"**This is a blatant false equivalence. Comparing Western criticisms of Islam to the genocidal policies of Nazi Germany is not only offensive but historically illiterate. Nazi Germanys atrocities involved systemic extermination, the West does not strip Muslims of their fundamental rights or humanity. You are free to wear a hijab, practice halal, and openly criticize governments in France, none of which would be tolerated in Saudi Arabia, where dissent is criminalized.Your argument collapses under your own choices. If Western countries are so dangerous for Muslims, why do you remain in France instead of moving to Saudi Arabia, where your faith supposedly thrives unchallenged? The reality is that you enjoy freedoms in France that Saudi women can only dream of, including the right to practice your religion without state-imposed penalties for deviating from it.If Saudi Arabia is the shining beacon of Islamic virtue, why do you choose to stay in a society that allegedly treats you as \\"the problem of the world\\"?--- **\\"As many others already said, youre only seeing this from your Western point of view and dont try to understand the point of others.\\"**The classic \\"Western bias\\" accusationa convenient deflection used to avoid engaging with universal truths. Human rights are not a Western invention; they are codified in global treaties that Saudi Arabia itself has signed, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Are you suggesting that Saudi women, who campaign against guardianship laws, imprisonment, and torture, are also blinded by Western bias? Or do their lived experiences not count because they challenge your romanticized narrative?Its not \\"Western bias\\" to assert that women should have the right to marry, travel (a freedom you freely indulge in while residing in secular France), and study without male permission. If you claim to champion Islamic equity, why defend systems that deny women the Quranic principle of free will? You benefit from the very autonomy you deny others.If cultural relativism excuses oppression, where do you draw the line? Should we accept apartheid, child marriage, or honor killings as valid cultural practices too?--- **\\"Moreover, youre acting like a neo-colonialist when people tell you that some women there are fine with it.\\"**This argument is intellectually bankrupt. A handful of women expressing contentment under oppression does not justify the system. History is full of examples where marginalized individuals defended their oppression: enslaved individuals who opposed abolition, women who resisted suffrage, and workers who supported exploitative labor practices. This isnt evidence of consent; its evidence of internalized subjugation.Saudi womens \\"happiness\\" under guardianship laws mirrors the psychological coping mechanisms of the oppressed. Research, such as the Hostage Behavior Model, shows that prolonged exposure to control breeds compliance, not genuine contentment. Even if some women claim to \\"choose\\" their oppression, what of the thousands who flee Saudi Arabia every year, risking imprisonment or death? Are they merely \\"brainwashed\\" by Western ideals?Every year more than 1,000 women try to flee Saudi Arabia. Text alerts sent by the Saudi authorities enable many guardians to catch them before they actually escape. The fact that so many risk their lives to escape doesnt signal satisfaction with their society; it signals desperation. The absence of large-scale revolutions isnt proof of contentment; its proof of repression.If you equate cultural acceptance with morality, would you also defend slavery or apartheid because \\"some people were fine with it\\"?--- **\\"You think they have been brainwashed into oppression, and they feel the exact way about Western women and their 'freedoms.' In fact, I personally know many conservative Muslim women who are not happy with the 'progressive' changes happening in Saudi Arabia.\\"**Conservative discontent with progress is nothing new. Every civil rights movement, from ending segregation to legalizing same-sex marriage, faced backlash from traditionalists. Discomfort with change does not invalidate its necessity. The fact that some Saudi women oppose reforms like driving rights or independent travel reflects the strength of systemic indoctrination, not the righteousness of the status quo.Your argument that Western women are \\"slaves to corporate desires\\" is laughable when compared to the reality of Saudi women requiring male permission to marry, work, or even leave their homes. Western freedoms include the *choice* to reject corporate cultureSaudi women are denied even the basic agency to decide their futures.If conservative women fear \\"progress,\\" does their resistance stem from faith, or from a lifetime of conditioning that equates independence with immorality?--- **\\"I personally think its better to live in a society that protects women through systems like guardianship than in societies where women are exploited and objectified under the guise of freedom.\\"**This statement reeks of paternalistic arrogance. Guardianship doesnt protect womenit infantilizes them. Saudi women are among the most restricted in the world, facing one of the highest rates of domestic violence globally. With male guardians controlling their legal, financial, and social lives, victims often have no escape. Contrast this with Western societies where women can access shelters, legal recourse, and financial independence.Objectification in the West pales in comparison to Saudi Arabias state-sanctioned denial of personhood. In France, you can critique media representations of women or campaign for change. In Saudi Arabia, voicing dissent against guardianship laws can land you in prison. Protection through control is not protectionits a gilded cage.If guardianship truly safeguards women, why does it rely on surveillance, coercion, and punishment to enforce compliance?--- **\\"I live in France, but where do you think its better to live? I personally think its better to live in Saudi Arabia, it's a better place for true Islamic values.\\"**This is peak hypocrisy. You cherry-pick the benefits of living in Francefreedom of speech, independent travel, and access to educationwhile romanticizing a Saudi system that denies these very rights to women. If Saudi Arabia embodies \\"true Islamic values,\\" why havent you relocated there? Perhaps its because deep down, you recognize the suffocating realities of life under Sharia law for women but prefer to virtue-signal from the safety of a secular society.Why is it that you advocate for Islamic governance while enjoying the liberties of a secular state?---If Saudi Arabia is the shining beacon of justice, equity, and Islamic perfection you glorify, then why do you hypocritically choose to live in Francea secular country you claim \\"oppresses Muslims\\"? Is it because you know the reality would suffocate the very independence youve come to take for granted? Is it because deep down, you know that the freedoms you cling to in Francelike unrestricted travel, education, and the ability to speak without fearwould be nonexistent under the suffocating system you so eagerly defend?","title":"CMV: Saudi Arabia exemplifies a society where cultural defenses serve as pretexts for systematic oppression"},{"text":"Biden should dissolve the US Supreme Court and through Executive Order initiate a nation-wide Audit with the use of the NSA/CIA to determine data breaches when/where and by whom, validate all ballots and verify all voters who submitted their votes were indeed counted correctly.After all, the US Supreme Court said he's untouchable.

Additionally, while it is true that the price of something like Humira is substantially higher in the US than in the UK, the same can be said, for example, about doctors salaries. In the US, a doctor can earn $400K annually, compared to 40-50K in the UK. This trend generally applies to most healthcare inputs.  \\n  \\n1.b/ Finally, I would add that with the current pricing model in Europe, pharmaceutical R&amp;D is not sustainable. If the US were to try to adopt European pricing levels, it would likely result in a substantial increase in drug prices in Europe rather than a decrease in prices in the US.2/ I do agree.  \\n  \\n3/ Total drug sales in the US are about $600B. Eliminating consumer advertisements would have a limited impact. Additionally, there is a freedom of speech consideration. Finally, Americans tend to visit doctors less often than citizens of other Western countries. Consumer advertisements can help people with chronic diseases on outdated medications become aware of new treatments and motivate them to consult their doctors.","title":"Neolibs gonna shill, shill, shill, shill, Shkrel..."},{"text":"No I haven't.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"his recognition of the need to engage with new media outweighs almost everything else (RFK Jr is a fucking anti-vaxxer jfc)","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"It was just generic whining about European negotiating on pharma prices.

This live exercise is part of the wider MILEX24 which also included a command post exercise part. It is an important step in the implementation of the full operational capability of the European Union Rapid Deployment Capacity (EU RDC), one of the key deliverables of the EU's Strategic Compass. The aim of the EU RDC is to enable the deployment of modular force of up to 5,000 troops to respond to a crisis outside the EUs borders. The Combined multinational exercise will be conducted under the command of Eurocorps and the German Army Command. The EU LIVEX will build on the German-led Exercise EUROPEAN CHALLENGE 2024. This live exercise will train the deployment of the EU Battlegroup Force Package 25 for a predefined scenario. 15 EU Member States* and more than 1,700 soldiers will participate in the EU LIVEX. The aim is to test the interoperability in planning and conducting common operation throughout all levels:  The Operation Headquarters (OHQ) at strategic level under the responsibility of Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC) from Brussels.  The Force Headquarters [(F)HQ)] at the operational level under the responsibility of Eurocorps, will train from Bergen (mainly) and Strasbourg, reinforced by an Irish company as force protection.  The EU Battlegroup (EUBG) troops at tactical level deployed in the Bergen training area. Germany provides the EUBG with the CORE Battle Group under the command of the Mountain Infantry Battalion 231, a light/reinforced infantry unit, as well as medical parts of the Medical Task Force (MED TF). Austria provides the Combat Service Support Battalion. A Distinguished Visitors and Media Day will be held in Bergen Training Area on 4 December. Further information will be provided at a later date. **Background** Since 2002, the European Union has been conducting crisis management military exercises to test the effectiveness of military command structures and procedures.\\nWithin this framework, the EU live exercises, with the first edition taking place in 2023 in Spain, are a key step in the implementation of the full operational capability of the European Union Rapid Deployment Capacity (EU RDC), which is one of the key actions under the EU's Strategic Compass. With the 2022 Strategic Compass, the EU Member States have adopted an ambitious action plan to strengthen the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) between now and 2030. Once fully operational in 2025, the EU RDC will enable the deployment of a European force of up to 5,000 soldiers, capable of responding to any crisis outside the EUs borders. It will stand as a robust, flexible and scalable military instrument of rapid response. Within this framework, Eurocorps will be the Force Headquarters ((F)HQ), responsible for commanding the European Union Battlegroup (EUBG) for the year 2025. *Austria, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Hungary, Croatia, Ireland, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Sweden. \\n!ping EUROPE&amp;FOREIGN-POLICY","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I mean the consumer sentiment index results post election show a huge gap down for Democrats and a huge gap up for Republican respondents.

Personally, I would lax the laws and make it easier to entry, as documented migrants are easier to trace in case they break any law. Some other people already explained better than me, why judging people by misdemeanours and barring them entry to US is unjust, seeing how US has already broken prison system. I would make sure to regulate companies from using people as cheap labour as they're the ones fuelling the problem and gain the most by hiring illegals, these same people wouldn't mind having slaves. If you can't hire people properly, without using cheap labor and immigrants, you shouldnt be having a business in the first place, as clearly you don't mind slavery as well if it were legal. I would rather focus on fixing the system itself, instead of demonising whole groups of people, as most migrants don't commit crimes and many have/had valid reasons to flee. US is so vast, rich and the unemployment is so low, clearly not the migrants are the issue itself, but rich people want you to believe that instead. I would take examples from countries, where recidivism is low like Denmark and rather fix those prison system and migration, than force people onto inhumane conditions. Rich folks laugh at us seeing how we fight for scraps blaming each other. All countries should have the need to thrive for better environment, further growth and comfortable life for its people, unfortunately we can only dream.Seeing how many immigrants there are in the US there's no way to deport them all at once, without gassing them and making it costly. Then again, I have empathy.You can blame all the countries' problems onto poor, elderly, migrants, women, disabled, like it always has been, see Margaret Thatcher or read some books about the Civil War and how people were being told rumours about black people - and maybe realise we make the same mistakes all over again with the issues being the same, as we put trust and power onto the same rich folks, who profit from populism as it gets them elected.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"Let me know how many wars you fought in because I'm at three and I know the majority of Gen Z is challenged by a flight of stairs.

The closures highlight the struggles of the Russian refining industry, which has been caught in the crosshairs of Ukrainian drone attacks, Western sanctions on Russia, which force refiners to sell fuel at a discount, as well as high interest rates. The five sources who work at companies, which operate the refineries and are familiar with the refineries' finances, said the three plants - Tuapse, Ilsky and Novoshakhtinsky - have suspended or cut runs in recent months. The development has not been previously reported.\\nIlsky and Novoshakhtinsky did not reply to requests for comment. The crisis is reducing fuel exports and denting companies' revenues, generating less cash for the state budget at the time of high inflation and uncertainties on energy markets, already concerned by sluggish demand. Refiners around the world reaped record profits in 2021 and 2022 from the post-pandemic surge in travel demand and recovering economic activity. However, margins then dropped sharply as huge new plants opened up around the world and demand growth slowed, partly due to efforts to transition away from fossil fuels. **LOW-TECH PLANTS SUFFER THE MOST** Russia's least sophisticated refineries, which produce no premium fuels, have been hit the hardest, posting losses of up to 10,000 roubles ($102) per metric ton during several months of the second half of 2024, two sources said. Some more complex refineries also operated at a narrow loss while others were able to post modest profits on robust light fuel sales, the sources said. Russia has 30 big and medium-sized refineries, not including several small plants, which are able to process 5.5 million barrels per day (bpd), making it one of the biggest fuel exporters in the world. Russia exports around 2 million bpd of oil products and consumes the rest at home. Russia's biggest oil firm, state-run Rosneft had to suspend refining several times this year at its large, but relatively unsophisticated Tuapse plant on the Black Sea due to weak margins, the sources said. Rosneft did not reply to a request for comment. Other major Russian oil firms - Surgutneftegaz, Gazpromneft, Lukoil - also did not respond. Smaller, independent Ilsky and Novoshakhtinsky refineries in Russia's south have been running at half of their nameplate capacity for several months, processing some 70,000 and 60,000 barrels per day respectively due to weak margins, according to four industry sources. All three refineries were hit by Ukrainian drones earlier this year, contributing to the low runs, the sources added.\\nIndependent refiners have to amass debts as they cannot count on support of bigger parent firms, the sources said. Russia's central bank raised interest rates to 21% from 19% last month, the highest level since the early years of President Vladimir Putin's rule in a move to further complicate survival for many plants, the sources said. Another issue was the rising cost of crude, which traded at 50,000 roubles per ton on the Russian domestic market in October versus a required maximum price of 35,000 roubles per ton for an independent refiner to make a profit, the sources said.

I stood firm and called for even more investment in public safety\\"Defund the police\\" is a shit name for the idea, but the idea is specifically \\"more investment in public safety\\". Under President Joe Biden, borders opened, inflation surged and disorder flourished in Democrat-led cities.Borders did not open. Inflation surged everywhere (but Biden handled it better than most).

They also formed the EU thanks to Soviet control right at their doorstepAlso, nuclear weapons haven't prevented numerous proxy wars and regional conflicts. The Soviet-Afghan war, Vietnam, Korea - all happened despite nuclear deterrence. Even today, Russia is waging war in Ukraine despite having nukes.We are talking about direct great power conflict. The last major war we had was WW2, at least with actual superpowers. Without nukes the world would get into conflict for other minor things as the Hungarian revolution of 1956 or the Suez CrisisThe real game-changer has been the rise of liberal democracy and free trade. Countries that trade together and share democratic values rarely go to war with each other. That's why the West has been largely peaceful since WW2, while authoritarian regions remain conflict-prone.You are ignoring the major amounts of conflicts between two democracies as for example the Cenepa war in 1995, you are also implying that just bacuse the liberal democracies, especially Europe are satellites of the US, then that mean that tehy are naturally peaceful.

I tell you why you are wrong on the first two counts.Preface: Prescription drugs account for 9% of US healthcare expenditure whereas insurance is involved in ~90% of all US healthcare expenditure. Jesus himself could conjure up Jesusbucks and pay for all prescriptions in the US and your healthcare cost problem still won't go away. See the forest for the trees.1) Americans are sick and tired of paying several times as much for the exact same prescription drug as other wealthy countries.A: Blame insurance companies. Pharma might be in cahoots with the insurance companies blah blah but at the end of the day this is happening because of insurance companies. In every OECD country the government practices monopsony price setting for healthcare goods and services. Only in the US and the US alone do the private insurance companies freely negotiate prices - why the fuck are they negotiating? Their profit motive is if you pay more, they make more money. Your private insurance is actively negotiating against your interests due to the prevailing incentive structure. 2) The costly FDA approval process adds costs and delays lifesaving drugs. The average out-of-pocket cost of developing and getting approval of a new drug is $1.4 billion. Here I tend towards an approach that would allow provisional sale of drugs after SAFETY approval, with labelling showing that efficacy has not been demonstrated, pending the efficacy trials.Terrible and dangerous idea. Trusting that the best drug will come out on top here is a fool's errand. In this model, pharma can just throw money at convincing users/media/doctors/health gurus/podcasters that their drug has good efficacy, and once people start consuming it the genie is out the bottle. They will burn down the FDA if they are emotionally/politically attached to this drug and in the end the FDA denies its efficacy claims. See: Covid.3) The US is unique in allowing consumer advertisements for prescription drugs.This is stupid. Get rid of it. Good point.Thanks for listening, and please go speak with some European and East Asian healthcare economists instead of asking /r/neoliberal. You sound very ideologically captured by the current political debate in the US. You are a Governor, talk to experts who have built working models of healthcare. G.F.

The FDA is not immune from the issues that government orgs have. But, it's also not hapless government body. Compared to  most, FDA is intelligent, relatively capable and efficient.

That's why \\"evidence based\\" policy traveled so poorly from the business world to government. *Good* evidence, on demand, is expensive. Hard. Meanwhile, the FDA process is also a major arbiter of intellectual property, and adjacent assets. By design, and by accident. As I said, there are issues. Real, serious issues.

I see it in my country - the guys who go to work everyday (or volunteer if they aren't allowed to work) are easiest to find (at their work), and when agencies have quotas to fill (this is how agencies operate) they start with the low hanging fruit. So the regular Joes are deported for minor stuff while the true criminals hide until this month's quota is filled.   Also, there's something economically wrong with deporting people: The USA heavily relies on immigrant work. So this will either drive up prices, drive down wages, or cause lots of unemployment (because the \\"unqualified\\" work enabling the qualified work isn't being done) - or combinations of the above.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"See i dont need to refute u.

RFK Jr. is in the position hes in, and no amount of frustration will change that. I get the instinct to lean into his taking on big pharma rhetoric and wrestle some good out of the situation. But as someone who takes Vyvanse, his stance on mental health medications like ADHD meds and antidepressants is deeply alarming.In a recent podcast, RFK Jr. proposed sending people on these medications to government-funded wellness farms to be reparented and weaned off their medspotentially for three to four years. Funded by cannabis taxes, these farms would involve growing organic food to reconnect with community. I dont want to be cynical, but wellness farms sounds suspiciously like labor camps where your Vyvanse is confiscated at the door.Youre absolutely right that big pharmas monopolistic practices and slow FDA processes drive up costs, but ADHD meds arent just expensivetheyre increasingly _unavailable_. This shortage is leaving millions of people in the lurch. Teva Pharmaceuticals, one of the largest manufacturers of generic Adderall, has been hit with labor shortages; meanwhile, the DEA, in its infinite wisdom, has imposed strict quotas on how much amphetamine pharmaceutical companies can produce, creating another bottleneck. And lets not forget the FDAs role in dragging its feet on approving new manufacturers or loosening supply constraints to help alleviate this crisis. People like me are being forced to ration doses, call every pharmacy in town, or go without entirely. And I cant help but worry that RFK Jr.s anti-medication stance will only exacerbate this shortage, further stigmatize people like me, and deprioritize the production and accessibility of these life-changing medications.ADHD meds and SSRIs are already FDA-approved, clinically proven, and essential for millions. The issue isnt efficacyits access. RFK Jr.s fixation on wellness farms and reparenting suggests he sees these medications as a problem to eliminate, not a tool to safeguard. I appreciate your effort to find common ground with RFK Jr. on reforming drug costs and advertising, but is he really the person to lead this charge? His pseudoscientific ideas about medication and food purity dont inspire confidence. People like me dont need wellness farmswe need access to affordable, effective medication.

This effectively would allow new drugs to be used \\"off-label\\" for conditions that a doctor believes that they will help with. About 20% of approved drug prescriptions today are off label, but they are only allowed for drugs that are ALREADY approved (eg, safety and efficacy for a DIFFERENT CONDITION).With respect, Governor, not only is this is a terrible idea but it demonstrates that you have not consulted with experts at the FDA who would be happy to educate you on how our regulatory system works. Drugs and Drug Candidates are very different things, and confusing them in this way will blow a hole in the ability of the United States to make drugs that work. Most off label uses of drugs are found to be effective when they are tested while most drug candidates that are worth investing in and are tested are found to not do what their developer hopes they will. However, you wouldn't just be allowing manufacturers to market the off label uses of drug candidates that are worth investing in. Decades of mismanagement at CBER has demonstrated how stubbornly permanent 'provisional' approvals can be outside of hyper-specific contexts, and the only important thing you would be doing would be to open the door for manufacturers to market drug candidates that are not worth investing in and never will be. The best you could hope for is to create a parallel market for drugs that are developed to stay candidates forever, where manufacturers specialize in telling good stories about why to naive physicians and patients rather than specialize in making good drugs. Moreover, what exactly do you think will happen when pharma executives realize that pretending to make drugs that work is much less risky than making drugs that actually work? This is not a hypothetical concern, RFK has been enmeshed for decades in market that already exists for 'medicinal products' that are designed to fool patients rather than heal them.

So if the Medicare reforms were implemented that limit drug prices to no more than those in other countries more widely, it would cause some pretty dramatic schisms in the market I think, where competing drugs might find they have wildly different maximum prices depending on whether they've got customers in Europe. Obviously the \\"high ceiling\\" drugs could lower their asking price, but without large orders in Europe, they'd _just_ be selling for cheap.

Most countries wouldn't accept these people back, especially if said criminal doesn't have any ties to his \\"original country\\". Why would they? They were born and/or raised in a different country. Despite their mistakes, most of them pay taxes that everybody gains from.Knowing Trump and his minions, he would use any loophole to frame people he doesn't want in the US. It's really easy to bust someone for drugs for example. Any charges also need time to process and deem the person guilty.I almost agreed with OP until he further explained his \\"plans\\". He has no idea about law, the court proceedings, how the justice system works, how much deportation costs, he doesn't even know the situation in Mexico it seems. People in Mexico dont fear persecution from the goverment itself, but the cartels. US' \\"War on drugs\\" decimated that country and made their situation worse - same as with the Talibans. US could end the immigration and the cartels issues long time ago if they truly wanted to - they dont have a problem with funding other wars - but that is too profitable as well as the cheap labor, to pass on. At least half of the Mexican police is bribed.Migration issues across Europe were also kicked forward due to US and their fight \\"for freedom\\". After 20 years of us complaining of USA being the world police, the goverment plans to abandon its allies as well as the immigrants they forced out of their countries, because it became suddenly inconvenient to their citizens and a good populist promise for people like OP. The events in Palestine will make current situation even worse.A stable goverment even in a poorer country doesn't grant you citizenship or entry in another country. Mexico is at war with the cartels not the goverment and even if they did, why the hell would you ever want to ask a hostile goverment that is after you for an asylum? Where's the fucking logic in that? jfc.Worst of all, he naively believes the system is always just and the goverment will always care for your wellbeing. It doesn't. We already have people sitting in jail for small shit like weed, women have life sentences for defending themselves from their abusive husbands and killing them, or things they didn't even do in the first place. US has more prisoners per capita than China. To any empathetic and intelligent person, it would ring alarm bells in their head.With a hostile goverment in power (which already threatens generals for example), it would be very easy for them to deport political opponents like AOC using denaturalisation as their \\"weapon\\".I dont know what OP even considers an \\"immigrant\\". Who is to decide how far the family line goes to be accepted as \\"true\\" American? This country was build on slaves and immigrants. I wonder if he ever tried to move to another country, leaving everything that one holds dear behind, and knows the horrible reality of it, especially for traumatised folks coming from a war torn or a hopelessly poor country, where one has only scraps to live from. I know - and the EU opening its borders literally saved my life.

Or do we just delay the age at which they start taking risks and therefore also delay the age at which they learn how to assess risks?We all stare in the mirror and ask ourselves how we were so fucking stupid as to let that happen because obviously a child shouldn't be climbing a mountain where the trail is marked by unrecoverable corpses.The very fact that he did it and in fact had climbed the highest mountain on every continent by 15 proves that they are capable. Why would we want to age restrict behavior that they are capable of?

I disagree quite a bit but its nice to see you engaging with the subreddit! I work in the tech side of the pharmaceutical industry (my views are what I picked up from learning about the business and my own conclusion, doesnt represent my companys beliefs per say)1. I agree that its not right that Americans pay higher drug prices in the US vs outside the US. You pointed out that Americans have higher incomes, but also since the drug market &amp; innovation is mainly made in the US, it heavily targets the US population. Meaning prices may be cheaper outside the US but they may not have the same access to these drugs as Americans do, where its more readily available here. Thus, companies accept the losses outside the US and allow other countries to negotiate prices while the US consumer base, their main customers, picks up the bill for other countries. While a ton of pharma companies offer payment programs for those in need of these medicines, I think the solution should be more geared towards sharing the price, bringing the price of drugs sold in the US down while bringing the price of drugs sold outside the US up, because theyre sold at a discount. Bigger solution is in point 22. I fully agree with your point, but its underselling how much R&amp;D costs for pharmaceutical companies.  The average price to bring a drug to market is around 4 billion and at bigger companies, it can reach up to 10 billion dollars https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/060115/how-much-drug-companys-spending-allocated-research-and-development-average.asp#:\\\\~:text=The%20average%20R%26D%20to%20marketplace,Congressional%20Budget%20Office.    For reference, Trumps net worth is I believe around 2.2 billion. It costs more to bring a drug to market than some billionaires net worth and costs are going up more and more each year. Tackling this problem will give the best return on investment, as high R&amp;D costs is what leads to necessitating a high return on investment, meaning higher spending on advertising, and higher prices for US citizens.3. It sucks to hear that some advertising is leading to worse patient outcomes, when it shouldnt be the case. Pharma advertising should mainly be to raise awareness, Health Care Providers (HCPs) have the final say and the final determination. Pharma companies cant force doctors to write prescriptions, the best they can do is raise awareness to viewers and HCPs about drugs available and if theyre covered by certain insurance plans, the HCPs have the final say on what drug to prescribe based on patients needs. This high spending on advertising is necessary because of number 2, extremely high R&amp;D cost better have extremely high return on investments, otherwise bankruptcy &amp; layoffs occurSomething you didnt bring up but Id like to touch on is the short patent protection lifespan of so many drugs. Its extremely expensive to bring a drug to market, and advertising is necessary to make people aware of a new drug in the US. These drugs arent cheap and Americans usually have to foot the bill for this. With how drug patents work in the US, you only get 10-15 years worth of patents on the drugs, meaning pharma companies have 10-15 years to make a ton of money before generics can be introduced at a cheaper rate. This is the dynamic driving so many pharma companies. While it mostly works for consumers after 10-15 years as generics will be cheaper (since they didnt have to go through expensive R&amp;D), in the short term, itll lead to higher prices, as pharma companies have to recoup their R&amp;D investment to get ready for another Hail Mary drug thatll get them ROI for another 15 years before the cycle repeats again. I dont know what the solution is. Ideally, longer patent time combined with lower prices would be nice, but I dont know if thats a viable solution or if the current workflow works just fine, but I wanted to bring it up to you for awareness purposes","title":"Neolibs gonna shill, shill, shill, shill, Shkrel..."},{"text":"My dude please don't tell me you're seriously defending Biden.

There are many more examples.

There was nearly zero change in any major metric for 3 full years.That was actually nice because it meant he didn't mess anything up.  But it also means he did nothing useful either.Any legislation that did pass was either down party lines like the tax code change or completely bipartisan bills that both parties voted for.  None of this was anything Trump campaigned on nor spearheaded during his term.But come campaign season 2020, he took credit for everything, even stuff that happened during Obama's term, lol.Then Covid happened, and he royally screwed that up.  The problem is people have no concept of how much better things could have been with a competent leader.  Most think the course of Covid was as good as it could have been.  That...is a big fat fallacy.  A good example is Vietnam which handled Covid exceptionally well.  Good leadership would handle everything significantly better, INCLUDING getting in front of it with boots on the ground in December when it first came up.  The US would have normally been heavily involved in world containment with a big push of personnel to help manage critical outbreak areas.  Trump did none of this.  All the resources of this great nation, and he didn't lift a finger.  If this happened during Obama's term, the outbreak would have been significantly different, not just far more rapid and SIGNIFICANT response to outbreak sites but heavy communication and support worldwide.  Equally, there would have been action plans in place to lock down and contain the outbreak and manage the spread...again like Vietnam.  It was possible.  It was manageable, and thousands, not millions would have died.This was the problem with Trump.  He didn't specifically do anything exceptionally bad in the context like Bush going to war in Iraq.  Trump let a million Americans die, but there's no context of what better could have been.  Tariffs were bad, but too many people are too clueless about them to understand they got shafted by one of the biggest tax hikes in recent history.Trump just takes credit for everything, lies about everything, and takes zero blame or responsibility.

That's before mentioning how he also has at every opportunity worked to drastically reduce legal immigration, too, despite the rhetoric about focusing on criminals.

I am fearful of the creation of detention centers.

I think it's best to set a statute of limitations for the initial crime of everyone the country illegally, and then give most illegal immigrants outside that time frame the opportunity to become naturalized citizens. If they don't want to pursue citizenship and pay taxes (or if they've committed other significant crimes), then they should be deported along with those inside the statute of limitations.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"Agreed.

By the time they're 20, they typically realize they were not very smart at 14.  By the time they're 30, they realize they were deeply stupid at 14.  Nobody 30 year-old, excepting a brain injury, thinks they were smarter at 14.  So, as a group, 14 year-olds are comparatively stupid.Because they are stupid, they do or can be persuaded to do very stupid things.  Other people share that characteristic, but young people as a group are far more likely to be stupid.  So they need to be especially protected from being stupid or being exploited because they are stupid.They are also smaller and more fragile, which is fairly relevant when you're talking about people driving at 30 mph on a device that relies on their body for control, fighting in a war, or climbing a mountain littered with corpses.  And we need to calibrate our rules for children to fit most children, not weird cherrypicked outliers.So let's imagine a world in which for whatever reason it became illegal for people to play Go before they turned 16.Why would we do that when there is no risk whatsoever entailed by playing board game?  Or chess?  Or Starcraft?  Or music?  Or math?And what happens when a 12yo tries to break the world record for the youngest person to climb Mount Everest and dies attempting it?We all stare in the mirror and ask ourselves how we were so fucking stupid as to let that happen because obviously a child shouldn't be climbing a mountain where the trail is marked by unrecoverable corpses.If you really want to climb Everest...it's not moving.  You can go when you're older.  It's not that complicated.  It's basic prudential reasoning; like...maybe you should be in peak condition before you go on a hike that might kill you?Yup, 18yos get into a lot less. And this is because 18yos have two years of experience that 16yos do not. If you remove that experience, all you'll do is move The Wall of Idiocy and 18yos will be the new demographic that gets into the most accidents.Except you're ignoring that comparing the same class if they started 16 vs 18, the 18 year-olds would be marginally better at the start.  The 18 year-olds wouldn't be as good as 18 year-olds who started at 16, but that's the wrong comparison.  The point is to reduce the number of stupid-hours and restrictions achieve that.But instead, now she just gets to wait until she turns 16 before she can hop on one in the first place, and when she does, she will still have to go through that exact same learning process. And three years of experience, learning, growth, and development will be sacrificed for nothing.She'll also be bigger, stronger, smarter, better coordinated, and have a better general understanding of risk.'Is that fair to them?' Is that fair to the 13yo girl who would like to start learning to ride an e-bike?Yes.  Obviously.  It's riding an e-bike, not getting a PhD in astrofuckanautics.  She'll learn how to do it over the course of a few weeks, plateau, and be more or less exactly where she'd otherwise be.Is it fair to essentially impose developmental delays in the name of protection?Yes.  Obviously.  We could probably get some great soldiers if we let them volunteer for a lifelong enlistment at 7 and trained them for 15 years.

Its entire existence is problematic because its intent is to avoid popular presidential elections. Once we started tracking popular presidential elections, we should have gotten rid of the electoral college because the electoral college is intentionally antithetical to direct elections.Originally, the constitutional framers intended for the electoral college to be a way to ensure the election of the president would not be beholden to the passions of mob rule- it was a check against the people. It worked as such: the (landed, educated, white male) population of a state would elect their state legislators, who would then elect the electoral college electors for their state, who would then elect the president (did I say elect enough in that sentence?)The electoral college is intentionally a very Republican system that is baked in layers of republicanism as a repudiation of direct democracy. The constitutional framers so disliked direct democracy in fact that originally only our Representatives, the members of the Peoples House, were directly elected, and even then party machines picked the candidates. Once we started to have popular elections of the  President, we should have gone with that system. Instead we largely kept the vestige that is the electoral college because its usually moot.Then we kept tweaking its rules until it turned into this thing it was never intended to be, and thus is very broken. We complain that it doesnt reflect the popular vote, but *its not supposed to*. Its creation is in large part to avoid direct presidential elections. Direct popular elections is a system of democracy. The Electoral College is a system of republicanism. Instead of going with either direct democratic elections for the president, or indirect Republican elections, we have this bastardized system that the founders never intended that creates discrepancies between who is the actually legitimately elected president.Hopefully that makes sense.

Basically established interest groups for various causes, environmentalists being one of them, have essentially a veto on Democratic politics, not because they provide good arguments but because that's been the default Dem policy for ages. These activist orgs rub shoulders everyday with Dem leaders, lobby them, provide research and funding and may offer a Dem politician work opportunities after they leave office. So a culture of deference to them has developed. For other orgs, at least you can argue that they ostensively represent electoral groups (Black voters, Latino voters, LGBTQ etc; although we've seen how much these groups aren't represented well by the orgs that purport to speak for them), but environmental groups don't even represent a real constituency. And since many of them either have a malthusian worldview or are outright NIMBY's they tend to veto environmental projects. And Dem leaders in all their infinite wisdom and sheep like behavior of following established norms...listen to them.","title":"Biden could have repealed the Jones Act, but didn't because it was anti-union..."},{"text":"When was Ukraine admitted into the union?

Now you have a person who has no connection to the country they were born in, does not have any family there, and doesnt speak the language. They are essentially Americans without the citizenship. Now imagine making a mistake and being exiled to Korea? No money, you dont speak the language, you dont know anybody, and you leave all your family behind in America. This is a thing that happens.Heres a wiki page about it:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_Korean_adoptees_from_the_United_StatesIf you scroll down to example deportations theres some pretty heartbreaking stories. Heres one:Phillip Clay (Kim Sang-pil) was found abandoned in Seoul in 1981 and legally adopted into an American family in?Philadelphia.\\nAfter a struggle with?drug addiction?and a run in with the law, Clay was deported back to Korea in 2012, despite no knowledge of the?Korean language?or customs, nor without a single contact in the country. In 2017, Clay ended his life jumping from the 14th floor of a building in?Seoul.[7][2]\\nAnother famous example is Adam Crapser, he was adopted from Korea as a baby in the 70s, he had the misfortune of ending up with 2 extremely abusive families, both were actually charged with child abuse and after he was removed from the second family he wound up in foster care. He had a rough start in life and was arrested a few times in his youth for domestic violence. He decided he didnt want to be an angry person anymore and turned his life around, became a barber, got married, and started a family. Years down the line when trying to find his adoption documentation he learned that he was not a US citizen and applied for his green card, this turned out to be a huge mistake as it alerted the system that he was not a citizen and had been arrested so he was looking at automatic deportation. He was deported back to Korea leaving behind his business, wife, and young daughters.\\nHes been pretty vocal, if you look his name up youll find a number of articles talking about him. He also participated in a 10 minute long documentary for vice that I strongly recommend:\\nhttps://youtu.be/ORAGvfeGrqc?si=kQMygjZ6C5rg-ZIx","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"Can you back up your claim that the US is to blame for three million deaths in the past twenty years?","title":"cmv: not standing for the american national anthem is NOT disrespectful"},{"text":"Completely agree!

He doesn't speak Spanish. He doesn't even know if he has family in any Latin American countries. He knows he crossed as a baby with his mom and she couldn't get citizenship for him. He's 19 and wants to join the military to get a Green Card. One day Jon gets into a fight with a guy who had groped his girlfriend. He can't afford a lawyer and is stuck with a public defended and is convicted of simple assault. Under your rule he gets deported.Or one day Jon gets caught with a small amount of weed on his person in a state where it is legal to carry. But he gets caught by a federal officer. Under your rule he gets deported.Or at night tries to find a bush to take a piss and thinks he's alone but someone records him and he is picked up for indecent exposure. Under your rule he gets deported. And keep in mind in all these cases that Jon is already fighting an uphill battle because he doesn't have the same access to resources that a citizen or resident has. He may not even have done the crime at all but the right (or I guess wrong) prosecutor, judge, or investigators mean he gets deported to a place he doesn't recognize, where he doesn't speak the language, and where he has no known family.This isn't unrealistic either - Jon is based on a friend of mine from college who went on to join the Navy.

Trumps administration deported about 1.5 million from 2017-2021. Bidens Administration has allegedly deported roughly the same figures as the Trump Administration. So over the last four administrations, 16 years, there have been around 5.9+ million deported with Obama being responsible for the most. Thats less than 1.5 million undocumented/illegal immigrants deported per administration. Since 2017 there have only been 95 cases sent to the DOJ for prosecution and denaturalization. There are millions of first-generation Americans. People need to stop fear mongering and understand that the government does have an idea of who they are going after. It is asinine to believe theyll just round up anyone. Since 2017 theyve reviewed thousands of cases and only 95 have been prosecuted and denaturalized. Basically less than 1% of the demographic is going to be investigated throughout the next administration. Very few people will be affected. There are millions of first and second generation Americans in this country that can vote and are law abiding citizens. They have nothing to worry about. Its racist to think they will just target anyone they deem an immigrant. If you think that Hispanic-Americans or Arab-Americans need to live in fear out of the risk of deportation/denaturalization then you are part of the racist problem.

Since 2017, there have been 95 cases sent to the DOJ for prosecution and denaturalization. Less than 100 individuals who deliberately changed their identities to be granted immigration benefits had those benefits revoked. In other words, out of thousands of cases that were reviewed, only 95 cases were deemed to have sufficient evidence that an individual lied to obtain something they may not have earned if they were honest from the beginning. We finally have a process in place to get to the bottom of all these bad cases and start denaturalizing people who should not have been naturalized in the first place, USCIS Director L. Francis Cissna. Very few people have actually gone through denaturalization since Trump was president. The idea that they will just go after anyone they see as an immigrant is insulting to those Americans who truly believe that Trump is not referring to them. To assume that our government doesnt have an idea of who they want to target as well is asinine. To assume that we, as Latino-Americans, should all fear possible deportation is racist. There are 65 million Americans who identify as Hispanic/Latino according to the 2020 U.S. Census, and were supposed to believe that any of us, hardworking, tax paying, law abiding citizens are going to be stripped and deported?

The Reddit bubble that was sure Harris would win is now sure that leopards will feast. Stop fear mongering. Youre not helping anyone. If you want to be an ally for undocumented/illegal immigrants then advocate for a plan. Let it be known that we want the immigrants here and that there should be an easier way for them to get documents so that they can get decent jobs and not be exploited for cheap labor. If you advocate for illegal immigration you need to advocate for a plan so that the undocumented can be documented and accepted quicker than it already is, so they have access to decent jobs with benefits instead of waiting around for an opportunity. Advocate for housing so that the then documented immigrants have places to live and communities to grow. Undocumented workers are cheap labor that cant fight for fair rights or defend themselves against the law to the opportunistic. Fight for their rights.

The very idea of unions is considered a human right worthy of protection by the UN and for good reason.  It was right to make sure union pensions have the ability to restructure and remain solvent.  It was right to show support for auto workers who gave up a lot during the Great Recession with the promise theyd get a bigger share when the companies came back stronger than before.  It was right to support legislation that said workers shouldnt be threatened and intimidated by employers during union campaigns and that there should be consequences if they do (current law has zero punitive measures, so violating the NLRA is routine).

I refuse to take antidepressants even when I'm thoroughly depressed and anxious most of the time. However I've been able to cope and have gotten pretty far with managing my GAD without prescriptions. I do have a couple low dose antianxiety pills just in case I have a reallyy bad day. But I never take them lately lol. They're only for emergency. and doctors keep trying to prescribe me a bunch of crap I don't need. I have acid reflux (apparently- you know how It goes, they diagnose you without proper tests half the time). I was told to take Omeprazole every day but I never take it and feel f*n fine. For some reason I suck at taking pills every day anyways. I think it's my body's way of saying \\"no\\" to what's not natural. I won't even take Tylenol or ibuprofen unless I absolutely need to. Heating pads, hot showers, wash cloths to your headache, etc helps too.  Stop trusting them and IMO we can start by not taking their dumb over prescribed drugs unless you have a serious medical condition and absolutely need it. I hear fasting works wonders too. Stop buying into their BS and take doctors recommendations with a grain of salt. Do you really think some provider that you talk to for 15 minutes knows your body better than *you* do? Haha, nope!!! These doctors are not GOD nor great healers like they like to portray. A lot of them are actually egotistical, especially in America. If you take a good long look at the healthcare system you will realize that multiple patients are crammed into 1 day for every provider and there is literally just no way these providers can take on healing so many sick people without making mistakes and burning out. Also don't forget it's a battle between healthcare facilities and insurance companies. They healthcare facilities are getting screwed A lot by insurance not paying up so you better believe they cut corners and try to make up for it by cramming A ton of patients in 1 day into 1 provider. A lot of these providers and healthcare management are a bunch of bullshitters IMO besides the occasional true good doctors or those who are truly passionate about what they do and/or have the grace and intelligence and moral compass to set boundaries to not cram their schedules. I can't stand what this world has become. Beware the organizations that claim they will heal you and/or are so empathetic bc often times it's the complete opposite and they will gaslight to cover it up. If you think about it deeply, the earth has everything we need and God and nature takes care of his people. I know many will call me crazy or ignorant for believing and saying all this but wake up people. I know and see the truth and others need to too.

The current physical fitness standards for women (for example, in the Army) are lower than those required of men.  This is not merit; this is strength and endurance-based affirmative action.  A few years ago, the Army tried gender-neutral fitness standards.  It was a disaster.  According to a RAND study of the gender-neutral fitness standards, only 52% of female soldiers could pass the gender-neutral ACFT (Army Combat Fitness Test), while 92% of the male soldiers passed.  Shortly after, the Army abandoned the gender-neutral test and went back to the lower standards for women policy that had existed for decades.  Well, this means that in combat, you have two tiers of fitness and endurance standards.  This could be a readiness and effectiveness problem for the Army.  If women can meet the same standards that the men must meet, then they should be able to serve in any role or MOS that the men do.  If not, then no.  Men who fail to meet this standard should not be able to serve either.  A standard is a standard.

In that sense, it should be legally wrong, in many cases, to move to a different country without permission.But in the case you describe, it feels difficult to argue that it's always immoral to illegally immigrate to a country.For one thing, when you say that a country \\"doesn't want you\\", this is complicated by the fact that many countries actually benefit, on the whole, from at least some immigrants who arrived illegally.Right now, for example, the US has a 4% unemployment rate. It's generally accepted by experts that 3 to 5 percent is a healthy unemployment rate; you can't get lower than that, as \\"frictional unemployment\\" is mostly unavoidable (sometimes people get fired, quit their jobs without having a new one lined up, etc. - that's just natural).Meanwhile, it's estimated that there are 8 million US workers who immigrated here illegally. Many of them are working at jobs that citizens would prefer to avoid.Doing the math suggests that these workers are actually benefiting the US as a whole. They aren't getting Social Security or other benefits, they're not taking high-paying jobs, they're contributing to the economy. So, it's not really the case that the country doesn't want them - it's more that the legal system doesn't want them, while employers *do* want them.Really, this just shows that our immigration system is broken. It's messed up that our country benefits from these immigrants, but we make it illegal for them to come here; presumably, we'd be better off letting in more people legally and then limiting illegal immigration more.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"These are good arguments, but given that you posted [this tweet](https://x.com/jaredpolis/status/1827765288575619180)Not sure how bringing back Measles and bringing back Polio makes anyone more healthya few months ago, it seems that back then at least, you recognized that the danger of RFK leading the nation's health policy far outweighed any of the beneficial policies he advocates.

An implicit premise is that the US justice system is inherently fair and just, only delivering jail time to people who really deserve it. You might believe this, but I would say among Americans its a controversial statement  certainly not something everyone believes. Anecdotally, I have discussed this topic personally with multiple prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges and not a single one of them holds this view. They vary on how fair they think the system is but they all acknowledge that we do, in fact, lock up innocent people and charge people overzealously to give them jail time when its not really justified.2. Even when they deserve it, deporting these criminals might not always be in the US interest. Suppose for example we have drug cartel members from Mexico in a federal prison. When we deport them to Mexico, are they more or less likely than before to do harm to the US? I would guess more. We have to decide if its better to pay for their imprisonment here, or risk their return to crime that negatively affects our interests (such as drug smuggling and production).3. Theres an assumption that the downstream consequences will be worth it. Lets grant your argument that theres no deontological reason why deporting these folks is morally wrong, there could still be something wrong with the plan if a large number of people are deported and it has some negative effect. A lot of formerly incarcerated people have jobs, and if they suddenly disappeared it could destabilize certain areas of the economy. I dont really know how many people fit into category 2, nor can I say with extreme confidence what the downstream consequences of such a plan (only deporting the people you describe) would be, but I do think these are unexamined issues with your view as stated that at least complicate the matter.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"I just know every time a private company needed to run a background check on me I had to sign off on it.Any slimy Republican is free to squirm out of a routine check by not taking the job.

I wouldnt put Steven hawking in charge of something that requires lifting 50 pounds compared to the average woman. Averages are average, not definitive. Reducing physical requirements by how much? Again if the role doesnt require that type of physical labor why does it matter? Let me put it this way. A 6,4 guy needs to be able to carry more weight than a 54 woman in the field. He needs significantly more calories and water by default. If they need to pull themselves up a rope the 64 guy again will need to be significantly stronger to pull himself up compared to the woman. I seriously doubt the military is going to send Lizzo to the front line. But if theres small differences and it doesnt impact the teams efficiency, why does it matter? Yes theres potentially roles women might have problems with tanks but thats a small part of the military. Women are lighter and have a lower profile than men for stealth roles as an example. They can also probably fit in jets more easily than men or submarines, etc. If youre a soldier youre a tool, and there hasnt been one tool that has been designed to be superior in every possible situation.

This rarely impacts the average American because most prosecutors aren't really interested in going after the average American. In a world where the Republican administration is looking to deport tens of millions of undocumented people, you are likely right that they will start with people who have criminal records, but once they run out of those people, they will very likely begin to use federal criminal law in such a way where they rapidly indict otherwise \\"innocent\\" people who have not truly committed crimes but can be shoehorned into a broad federal crime.

I'm convinced that so much of the problems with breaking through to people is that our media has convinced them that their feelings matter more than objective reality. Ignore plenty of positive objective economic indicators - people still feel the squeeze (even though we know partisans' view of the economy is going to improve by 30 points on January 20th for no particular reason.) Kamala didn't make a bit deal about being a woman or biracial, but doesn't it *feel* like she did? Hell, even left-leaning people aren't immune to it. It takes like 20 seconds for some rando to remind you that Flint doesn't have clean water, even though it has had clean water for literal years at this point. Good intentions don't cover falsehoods that do nothing but sow distrust in institutions. Not really the point of your post but that's become a huge pet peeve of mine. Anyway, answers: 1. I've had this with a coworker who I do tabletop gaming with, and my brother. They can usually point to some random obnoxious person on Twitter or Vanity Fair or something doing a performative \\"men, amiright?\\" bit, but nothing really beyond that. And in fairness to them, I also find it pretty cringe-worthy. But then I'll see them repost something like Harrison Butker's speech talking shit on women with jobs. It's very hard to see it as anything but insecurity that other people are happy with other lifestyles. Most people don't actually care that you want to be/have a tradwife, you trying to crowbar your lifestyle on other people is what people lash out at you for. \\n2. I don't have the patience for it. Again, we have a society that coddles peoples' narcissistic perceptions of what we as Democrats do or don't do. If people are going to insist that we're abandoning them due to support trans rights or women's rights, they're not going to change their mind if we try to walk it back, they'll just find some other grievance.\\n3. I don't want to belabor it too much, but as a straight man who's fallen on very hard times in the past and didn't go down these paths, I'm very much not interested in trying to understand manosphere dudes right now. Not proud of it, but I know I'm not in the mood to and probably won't be for a while. That said, one thing I've always found effective it to weaponize that persecution complex. You think JK Rowling is on your side fighting the woke agenda? Think again, her hatred of trans people is tied to her hatred of men. These people don't like men, don't respect men, have a low view of men, and want to exploit you for their personal gain. If you're on their side, you're a weak-willed follower. (Again, I'm probably not the best guy for this lol. I doubt I'll win anyone over, but I think it does take the wind out of some men's sails and makes the whole masculine facade feel faker.)\\n4. I do think there's some genuine improvements to be made in messaging. \\"Identity politics\\" is kind of a shibboleth to let people know you're against wokeness or whatever, but I think there is maybe one legit criticism to be made in there. I do think we assume to much about what specific identity groups want or even identify with themselves. I've met too many black college conservatives or working-class lesbians (who identify more with the former than the latter) to assume I know who literally anyone is going to vote for. This probably sounds passe, but I do think speaking to universal issues of opportunity, while still making it clear that Democrats want to enable everyone to live the specific life and expression they see for themselves is a much more winning message.
