The regions under the USSR were free to practice their own languages in most aspects of statecraft and everyday life.\\nYou could call the way that the USSR was propagandised to be \\"the best state in the world\\" as a form of nationalism - but that is not the ethnic nationalism that you seem to think is central.\\nI want to push back on China a little because its much more complex than just Xinjiang and Tibet. They also have a concept of (iirc) 5 core ethnicities, and do have large regions speaking languages other than Mandarin and ethnicities other than Han. The biggest examples are Hong Kong and also a region of Mongolia (I forget whether it is \\"inner\\" or \\"outer\\"). I'd have to check whether different subdivisions are allowed/encouraged to practice their language for statecraft (etc) or not.\\nBut the centralisation of the Chinese state around Mandarin is pretty inarguable, and it does seem like they are pushing for slow erasure of all but Mandarin speakers in the long term. I certainly wouldn't call them a shining beacon on non-nationalistic multiethnic socialism. But they are far more that than, say, America or modern day Russia - similarly sized nations with ethnic and linguistic minorities that they could promote if they wanted (and no allowing people of different skin tones to fully intergrate into your own culture does not make you a good example of a multiethnic state - because that is still one culture being held by multiple races rather than multiple ethno-linguistic groups).","title":"CMV: Left-wing politics cannot succeed on a national level without nationalism or a strong sense of national identity"},{"text":"That is not what I said. The burden of proof is not a logical fallacy, for starters. The proper relation to it is an epistemic one: is someone doing their proper epistemic duty or not? It seems OP is not failing necessarily on this end. As for whether he has provided enough social evidence or not is another thing.Take, for instance, my claim that \\"my mother has a dimple in her nose\\". Even if I don't provide YOU evidence for it, it doesn't mean I have not satisfied my epistemic burden(proof is an overly strong term for the epistemic concern, btw). It is clear I have sufficient and justified evidence that my mother has a dimple in her nose. But what if you ask for me, and I told you \\"I know because I have seen her dimple in her nose\\". Would it be good to say \\"oh, there are other possible reasons\\". Sure, there are. But that doesn't invalidate my experiential evidence.\\\\ Saying \\"There is a pink giraffe in mars\\" and \\"There ISN'T a pink giraffe in mars\\", according to you, are subject to the same fallacy.Both are positive claims. Do they intend an epistemic burden? If so, they need to satisfy it. Because, yes, to say there isn't a pink giraffe in Mars would be something that requires evidence. It happens to be the case, though, that epistemology has many concerns, including some concerned by doing one's duty and inferences. We have priors that make the likelihood of the existence of any kind of giraffe in Mars unlikely. But the problem of priors is that they are not objective. If I lived in China in 1200s I would likely have little or no prior in Viking men coming to my village.

He was the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for many years, where he played large role in shaping U.S. foreign policy and building international relationships.He was usually able to make a deal with the opposition, which is one of the pillars of our democracy.Biden was able to make deals with the most obstructionist opposition in modern US history ( if not ever, apart from the era around the civil war ),From what I can see, President Biden has absolved himself of all nuttery going forward. As well he should. He served the country extremely well and very likely would have given four more productive years. But ...

Obviously the more centrist the politician, the less left-wing the legislation they support. So it's relatively easy to pass centrist legislation, but the more leftist the legislation the more difficult to pass. As OP lays out, Biden passed a 1% tax on stock buybacks, passed massive investment in climate change, and tried to expand the welfare state with an expanded CTC (incredibly ambitious considering narrow margins). Contrast that with a Republican Presidency, which at minimum would have seen an attempt to make the Trump tax cuts permanent. Those are all laws that that helped voters.My problem with so-called \\"leftists\\" is not their (ostensible) goals, which I mostly support. It's that they prioritize being angry and purity politics over pragmatism and concrete actions that improve people's lives.   \\nIf Bernie Sanders had become President in 2017, he would still have been limited by the which bill's Joe Manchin (and other Senate moderates) would be willing to vote for. Those are the facts, and pragmatists deal with them. Thats not to say you can't criticize Democrats.

Left wing nationalism does exist though.Also, a core leftist point is that we share more meaningfully in common across class lines than we do along national lines.

They refused and allowed corruption and incompetence to reign. The men of Afghanistan could not be bothered to defend their women and I look at their culture and values and see a people not worth defending. Leaving Afghanistan was the right thing - but not the way we did.  What was the answer? I don't know. Hand over control to another Nation? Hand over the keys to the armory to the civilians so they had a chance to stop the Taliban when they advanced? Pull our material hardware out and rain down destruction from the air once the Taliban climbed out of their hidey holes? Maybe leave the Nation but keep providing air support for 1-2 years?Part of me thinks the best option was to remove our hardware, give civilians all the small arms and provide air support for a fixed period of time.

I 100% agree with the idea that nationalism (although I would personally call it national liberation) was at the core of many anti-colonial/anti-imperialist revolutionary movements. To this day, the concept of the century of humiliation (the 100-ish years prior to the rise of the PRC) is a foundational means of how Chinese people, and the government of the PRC, understand Chinas position in global affairs. Cubas revolution was just as much against American corporate hegemony as it was against the Batista dictatorship. The reason I use the phrase national liberation rather than nationalism is that these anti-colonial/anti-imperialist movements were resisting the occupation and exploitation of their lands by imperialistic nations. This was a struggle by the colonized peoples of the world against the great empires that dominated global affairs and markets for centuries through the barrel of a gun. Meanwhile, in the West, nationalism is a distinctly right-wing ideology. The nationalism of Western Europe and the US (and later Japan who adopted this same framework from European and American sources) was not about liberation of an oppressed people or the end to colonial violence instead it was about oppressing other peoples and inflicting colonial violence. Nationalism has never meant the same thing as national liberation the former is the source of exploitation, colonialism, and imperialism, and the latter is in opposition to those exact things.","title":"CMV: Left-wing politics cannot succeed on a national level without nationalism or a strong sense of national identity"},{"text":"Here are the numbers according to the BLS (https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/ces0000000001?output\\\\_view=net\\\\_1mth):2018 - 2,283,000 jobs added2019 - 1,988,0002022 - 4,528,0002023 - 3,013,0002024 - 2,232,000So to compare:Trump 2018/19 - 4,271,000Biden 2022/23 - 7,541,000 (3.27 million more jobs or 77% more)Biden 2023/24 - 5,245,000 (974 thousand more jobs or 23% more)  \\nBiden beats Trump anyway you want to slice it","title":"Biden job gains top Trump and Obama"},{"text":"The only thing history is in the middle of showing right now is the dangers of socialist/progressive economics and how they truly are pseudo-scientific and Elitist.","title":"Biden defends Afghanistan withdrawal that ended in catastrophe and insists 'history' will prove he was right"},{"text":"Catholics were the original Christians, in fact!","title":"How many people here are Christians?"},{"text":"The maga cultists actually believe greedy billionaires are going to convince the rest of the greedy billionaires in the US to make less money.

But this is conditional on someone knowing him or his teachings.

My point is that if they themselves dont want to try, theyre complicit in letting republicans spin and control the narrative.If it wasnt for Reddit spoon feeding Biden administration accomplishments, I would have no idea what the hell Biden did over the past 4 years, and how good he was in most aspects. That was the average American. The Biden Administration failed to broadcast the good they were doing, and in doing so let Republicans control the narrative until it was far too late.The issue is that Democrats arent offensive enough. Republicans always play on the offense, so when the Democrats choose not to, thats a reflection on the entire party, and usually ends with Republicans being on top. The fact that Donald Trump wasnt sentenced for his inciting of J6 should be proof of that.But yay, now we get to complain for 2 years about not having any mechanisms of power to wield against the Republicans onslaught of terror.","title":"Biden calls Metas decision to drop factchecking really shameful"},{"text":"Catholic here","title":"How many people here are Christians?"},{"text":"TikTok can't invoke the First Amendment... it doesn't apply to foreign entities.","title":"Mark Kelly says he is aware TikTok ban is controversial, yet there is national security risk to' app"},{"text":"Sorry, your post has been removed for breaking [Rule 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_5) because it appears to mention a transgender topic or issue, or mention someone being transgender.

So yes I agree that something is needed to overcome the fact that this economic system is not natural and cannot coexist with economic freedom, but I believe that you could accomplish this without nationalism. However, nationalism is such an easy and cheap tool for a despot to use that they are almost guaranteed to use it, but I dont think its 100% required. Also just because a government promotes a nationalistic message doesnt mean that the population necessarily agrees with it, they might be too scared to say anything for fear of being branded enemies of the country.","title":"CMV: Left-wing politics cannot succeed on a national level without nationalism or a strong sense of national identity"},{"text":"Trust me I am.

The only way a leftist regime can actually succeed in the US is as a response to a catastrophic event where they have massive public backing, even then it won't last long.","title":"CMV: Left-wing politics cannot succeed on a national level without nationalism or a strong sense of national identity"},{"text":"1 clarify the first amendment that freedom of the fee press means the right of anyone to publish any speech in any form of media, not the creation of a professional,  establishment protected propaganda system masquerading as a professional press corps working for the benefit of the left and immune from libel and slander prosecution. 2 clarify the second amendment to ensure that the right exists to protect the citizens from a tyrannical government, and is therefore absolute, and includes the right of any law abiding citizen to own any weapon he can afford, including \\"military\\" arms. 3 clarify that it is the responsibility of the legislature to write the laws, and that responsibility cannot be abdicated to the executive branch through administrative rule making. 4 insist that the legislature include a statement of intent to guide the judicial branch in how to interpret the law and the executive branch in how the law is intended to be enforced, so as to avoid hidden sabotage in the wording of the law or deliberate misinterpretation due to perceived ambiguity. 5 no God damned omnibus legislation.

Sure many times they blame someone else for the misfortunes of their nations but then they reccomend something like tax benefits for parents, deportation for criminals etc. It is just that people agree with their own takes rather than demonize the left, which to be honest isn't inherently open-border EU and with such a stance could attract voters that vote right because of immigration. So at some point, the actual politician needs to provide a course of action which is radical for modern technocratic standards and people agree because they are impoverished.Also I wonder if the solution part in the US doesn't happen on the national but on state level.

This, to me, is where the concept of GOD is unavoidable.Why? Because Logic is a category that belongs to the mental. It is also a category beyond existence(beyond space and time and concreteness). It is also something universal and absolute. So, this already entails a universal, absolute Mind that is the pre-condition for any rational structure and any real structure which you don't possess but which you can access(because you don't create Logic, we think logically, which is not the same) and also transcends you as a finite creature(because in order to even establish your own existence you use Logic). Logic also cannot be impersonal for three reasons:  \\na) Its category is conceptually mental by nature,  \\nb) In order to not have an infinite regress Logic must be self-grounded in a way that relates to itself(I could expand on this if you will), which this can only be done by a Mind that self-relates and then relates all entities unto itself and through itself,  \\nc) Rationality is an intrinsic feature to our own mode of being as persons. No ultimate reality that is not of a personal nature could be apprehend by us as persons. Given that we can apprehend the category of ultimate foundation, logic, and relate them, it means our personhood can apprehend it as such(which entails it is not impersonal).Does this mean the Christian GOD? No, but in a further analysis, we can see that the fundamental structure of reality is trinitarian by necessity(object, subject, medium; this is the basis of all semiotic and hence all meaning). Minimally, it negates atheism and leaves open the Mystery of how GOD relates in the concrete with ourselves and the World.","title":"CMV: God is definitely not real."},{"text":"OK, I have to ask about Greenland.","title":"NVIDIA Statement on the Biden Administrations Misguided AI Diffusion Rule"},{"text":"It's only idpol if it doesn't involve my in group","title":"Maybe It Was Never About the Factory Jobs"},{"text":"Just repeat deadly insurrection and never go into who died and how.Just like 34 felonies without detailing what they were","title":"Redditor wishes that more people died in Jan 6.

The energy industry for example requires a lot of infrastructure and relatively few workers. The insurance industry requires little infrastructure and a lot of workers to process claims. All industries tend to have the same rate of benefit. If there was extraordinary benefit in one of them, capital would shift towards that industry. Factories would be sold and refurbished. Until the increased competition would bring the benefit back to around the median.How then, for different compositions of capital (or rate of exploitation as they'd call it), the benefit is the same?Bohm-Bawerk explained this very well.2- What they criticize capitalism for is inherent in socialism. A socialist society with socialized healthcare, armies, infrastructure, education, etc, CAN ONLY BE POSSIBLE BY PAYING THE WORKER LESS THAN WHAT HE PRODUCES. There is literally no other way to finance such a society, it must come from taking value from workers to finance all those other things.","title":"How to argue with dem socs?"},{"text":"no i didn't say he should've snapped his fingers.

Most people didn't actually qualify for PSLF under Trump as direct loans (the ones that qualified for PSLF) didn't really proliferate until 2010 when the FFEL program was terminated. Biden had to enact a massive waiver process during his Administration which allowed many people who didn't really qualify under the actual program eligible for forgiveness under it. I'm sure Trump could have done something similar if he was so inclined (which he wasn't); however, its misleading to say they outright refused to process it. They generally just held people to the actual rules of the program whereas Biden waived many of those same rules (including allowing some payments that were clearly said to be ineligible according to the legislation as qualifying payments). PSLF recipients are pretty fortunate Biden started the waiver process back in 2021 before student loans became a hot button issue in 2022 with the large forgiveness program.

I'll be the first to admit he says some stupid things (talks about adding Greenland, Panama Canal, Canada to the US constantly), but he isn't the first to mention a lot of that, and I've seen no compelling evidence that Trump is a Hitlerian fascist dictator. Fascist dictators don't leave office and then rely on elections to come back to power. If that's the case, I guess Grover Cleveland is a fascist dictator.2 - Skimmed the first half of a very long piece about this (I don't have time to read the whole thing right now), but the relevant parts seem to be about Jan 6 (I'm well aware there are crazy far-right people out there gathering in mountain hideouts preparing for the end of days or whatever). Firstly, let's make it clear that I hate what happened on Jan 6. That being said: If the whole thing was an elaborate conspiracy to overturn the election, Why was nobody armed? Why are there videos of Capitol  Police escorting rioters around? Why was there no desperate battle between the \\"\\\\[un\\\\]armed insurrectionists\\" and the military in an attempt to save America's way of life from the \\"fascists\\"? Probably because angry people rioting was not going to end almost 250 years of American democracy.3 - Haven't read the book, and I don't have time to now, so I won't comment.4 - I do know how to identify propaganda, thank you very much. Whenever I try to learn about a new issue or what have you, I seek out multiple unbiased sources and ignore the ones pushing a narrative. That aside, I get that a lot of international leaders are wary of Trump. He says a lot of alienating things and has a very...bold personality. He also comes from a different ideological background than a lot of current leaders, especially in Europe, but that doesn't warrant a comparison to Hitler. Important people buying into a stupid idea does not make the idea any less stupid.4 (5?) - Blaming half the country is just par for the course in American politics right now. Both sides do it, as much as I wish they wouldn't. I'm not aware of any political prisoners Trump has taken. If anything, Dems tried to make him one with all of the lawsuits and whatnot.

I personally think he was a very productive president, and surprisingly progressive for how divided the country has been and how MAGA-poisoned the well has become.  \\nBut I want to propose a different angle: The left is not really in a state where it can acknowledge victories, even when they are happening.I am not sure why this happens necessarily, but the right does not have this issue. They are lockstep behind their figurehead, and there is little to none dissent. No republican commentator, pundit, media personality, or politician can meaningfully stand up to Trump or criticize him in any real way without being instantly shunned by the whole movement. So when they vote, they all vote, and when decisions are made (however stupid or insane) they stand unquestioningly behind it.This is madness I believe. But the left is also mad in a way, because however imperfect Biden or Kamala are, they are qualified serious people with the capacity for leadership. I may not agree with EVERYTHING they do, but knowing that the alternative is Trump, the left should be unified in supporting them. Instead, we repeatedly see them held to an entirely different standard. Kamala was criticized mercilessly during the campaign, a lot of times from the left.A good example is her less-than-good take on Israel-Palestine. She may still be orders of magnitude better than Trump both in her take, and her ability to deal with such a complicated issue, and yet, somehow so many lefties decided to stay home and now we are stuck with this idiot for another for years.

He did what the Left has done since 1932, and better than most of his Democratic peers: he delivered competent governance and tried to use government to advance the needs of citizens. You'd think that would be enough. But when Republicans are in power they spend the time they're not enriching themselves in actively undermining the Left. And we see the results before us. Obama and Biden both had an opportunity to cast our collective gaze back across the devastation wrought by previous administrations and force us to observe the lesson: Conservative governance is a disaster. They didn't do that. That failure, the results of not understanding the nature of the threat, is the same thing that's doomed every democracy that's fallen to right-wing extremism across the 20th century, not only in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany, but in Chile, Argentina, El Salvador, Guatemala, Iran, and more.

Social safety nets will be demolished because they're too expensive while he gives billionaires another trillion dollar tax cut, the economy will crater and, just as during the pandemic, those same billionaires will vastly increase their net worth yet again with assets of what's left of the middle class.Hard to find a victory there.","title":"CMV: Biden's term in office did not meaningfully deliver victories for the American left domestically"},{"text":"You're acting like he's some kind of mythical beast.I think trump's a buffoon who wasn't eligible to run for any political office after his attempted coup he ran from the WH.

Biden was *real* gung-ho about what was happening. Enthusiastically supportive of Netanyahu. Netanyahu came to power by getting his pro-peace predecessor assassinated and then running explicitly on anti-peace rhetoric. He then became Hamas's primary political sponsor and, based on #s coming out of the West Bank alone even if you ignore everything else, established himself as possibly the most prolific terrorist warlord of the modern era. If conflict in the region ends, Netanyahu almost certainly goes to trial and potentially spends the rest of his life in jail (given his age). Giving this man more weapons was never going to end well, peace is directly against every incentive he has.So Biden's only plan for peace was to give infinite bombs to a man opposed to peace on personal, professional, and political reasons. And then when the bodies ramped up and up (I'm terrified of what's under that rubble and thoroughly believe we're in the hundreds of thousands of child casualties alone)...Biden's response was continued overt support for Netanyahu and more bombs. While barely acknowledging what was happening on the best of days.To this day, Biden is riding a \\"rah rah patriotism\\" train that's built out of child corpses. He still doesn't seem to get it. At this point I'm wondering if it's a sign of cognitive decline that he's just not seeing the horror, or if he's internalized the complete dehumanization of Arabs that's been so common in America. \\"Oh, it's just a bunch of brown, mostly Muslim kids who cares\\".

Even if leftism requires a strong sense of community to succeed, that doesnt need to be a national community. Nationalism is a fairly modern concept. Until about a couple of hundred years ago, with the French Revolution and then the unification of countries like Italy and Germany, most people didnt really identify with a nation state. When states (as opposed to tribes) existed at all, they were defined not by blood but by being under the control of a king, emperor, or sultan. It was normal for these people to have foreign roots (for example, the current royal family in Britain are Germans, and the Muhammad Ali dynasty of Egypt were Albanians). Ordinary people identified most strongly with their local area. It would be very unusual to travel to the other side of your country in those days, and if you did, the people would probably speak such a different dialect that you wouldnt get along with them and youd instantly seem foreign. If you did identify with something bigger than your local area, it was probably a religious institution, like the Caliphate or the Catholic Church. In the 1800s, nationalism began to make more sense due to technological and political advances. Things like mass literacy, faster transport, and Enlightenment-era philosophy. Even today, if you travel to pre-industrial, rural areas of the poorest countries like Afghanistan or Yemen, people will identify much more strongly with tribes or clans than a nation-state. This is normal for most of human history, nationalism is arguably the aberration. So as technology continues to develop, people move around more than ever, and ideas continue to go in and out of fashion, nationalism may also decline in importance. We might identify with different forms of community again. Perhaps it will be one of these that leftists unite around.","title":"CMV: Left-wing politics cannot succeed on a national level without nationalism or a strong sense of national identity"},{"text":"The American Way.","title":"Trump admins question civil servants who they voted for"},{"text":"Good guess! https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-hostage-release-ceasefire-deal-hamas-israel-brink/story?id=117630406","title":"Discussion Thread: President Biden Delivers Final Foreign Policy Address"},{"text":"Calm down there chunky, I dont watch any cable news.But you sure seem to be invested in it.","title":"Bezos enables Trump's threat to democracy, WashPo columnist says as she quits"},{"text":"??this is the kind of wacko comments that radicalize people....why would you want to align yourself with someone who talks about people this way?

You have Israeli officials literally foaming at the mouth to re-settle Gaza and the more radical, far-right in Netanyahu's government will instantly pull any support of a ceasefire if they see Netanyahu giving concessions that are contrary to their overall goals. Israel knows that Trump and Huckabee both love the WB settlements and it knows that the need to put up a facade to look like they care about Palestinian civilians will evaporate the very second that Trump is inaugurated.I see a lot of people compare Hamas/Gaza and Hezbollah/Lebanon and act like they are equated in terms of Israeli policy vis a vis a ceasefire. The reality was that Israel was much more willing/eager to accept a ceasefire with Hezbollah because they are a much stronger entity than Hamas...they have the power to actively strike Israel back. The IDF's recent operation with Hezbollah was a costly theatre for Israel - it's actually an absolute disaster in that morale is extremely low nor have they made any significant territorial gain. Internally, a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah was quite popular given the group has more or less forced those in northern Israel to flee.Lebanon is also a physical sovereign state with a very wealthy overseas diaspora so there were greater political costs for that operation.Israel faces none of those hurdles with Hamas in Gaza - which is a much weaker entity than Hezbollah. You don't sign a ceasefire with your weaker opponent.I also see a lot of mentioning of hostages - the very sad and unfortunate reality is that the Netanyahu government wrote off the hostages over a year ago. Just look at the way the hostage families are treated in Israel - they literally regularly arrest them for protesting in Tel Aviv.","title":"Biden says hostage-release, ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel 'on the brink'"},{"text":"I didnt lick the oligarch boot for the tasteYou still licked it, enthusiastically.

This is why Roe v Wade created a right to abortion out of thin air from the 'Right to Privacy\\" in the 9th amendment (huuuge stretch).

It also prohibits companies from expanding foreign investment. While companies are not completely restricted from using non-government funds for buybacks / dividends, as that would likely completely deter them from pursuing these government grants, they are required to submit 5-year buyback / dividend plans in their applications, which affects the funding and restrictions on the funding they receive. The CHIPS act also includes a bunch of other requirements regarding worker incentives and protections, profit-sharing, and has already resulted in semiconductor companies announcing a bunch of new domestic projects. So, I'm confused on what specifically you find problematic with the CHIPS Act that isn't completely unrealistic, or a non-starter.\\nSpeaking of stock buybacks, Biden's 1% tax on stock buybacks was welcome but in my opinion too modest to alter a practice that could potentially damage American competitiveness for the long term (as companies like IBM are spending more on buybacks than R&amp;D).\\nExpecting Biden to be able to pass a much larger tax on stock buybacks is just wishful thinking that ignores the incrementality of progressive legislation, and the reality of a partisan congress this legislation needs to go through.","title":"CMV: Biden's term in office did not meaningfully deliver victories for the American left domestically"},{"text":"How would that be scaled to a national or international level?

A small group of militants largely reliant on sclerosis between members of NATO for survival (which is now in question with Turkey gaining the upper hand locally).None of these are really examples of success, and insofar as China is arguable, its difficult to argue that its a success of left-wing politics when the things that made China successful where where it abandoned left-wing politics substantively.The issue with nationalist leftism is that it attempts to maximize two axes against each other when most people cant conceptualize complicated political thought to allow for multiple axes of political disagreement to begin with.

Most countries are able to pull together and fight for a common cause because they have that sense of identity. The French have a very unique communal sense of identity, as do Norwegians, Japanese, etc. America does not have that on a national scale at all. The sense of community you mention is laudable and great, but it is extremely local to your town or neighborhood. It also does not extend to government - many, many Americans (including likely some of the people you know) care about their neighbors but consider ANY form of government, even a basic local government, to be \\"tyranny\\".

For example, only king should be able to declare wars, declare alliances and rivalries, sign international threaties even without parliamentary sanctions. Or he should be able to veto some laws (regarding culture), like removal of state religion or allowing LGBT marriage (those laws should return back to parliament), and he should be able to pardon somebody (but only in a specific circumstances), give citizenship to somebody (but not revoke), and that's mostly it. Parliament should be able to force a king to resign and change to his heir.So, just to be clear, do you want them to be able to declare wars in like a \\"rubber-stamp\\" sense- as in basically approving decisions made by parliament, or do you think he and only he should be in charge of wars/alliances/foreign relations, with no input required by parliament or the Prime Minister? If so, why? Why is the king uniquely suited to this role rather than somebody who was elected by the people?Part of what I'm getting at is, do you acknowledge that the UK as it currently exists and every constitutional monarchy in existence today are liberal democracies? It is okay. But why you want to fight in a peaceful discussion? Better understanding can lead to changing views.\\"Fight\\" can be used in a metaphorical sense here. It is an hierarchy. So, if your family member suffer, it is okay to make others suffer, if you save her. If your friend suffer, it is okay to make others (but not family) suffer for saving him. If a member of your culture suffer - it is okay to make members of other cultures suffer if you save him (but not previous three).But again, would you not agree that we all share the common identity of being human? And if so, shouldn't we, on some level, seek to prevent or mitigate the suffering of other members of the human family? In other words- human rights? I think it is. It is simply unjust to have only one supreme power.What? That's not even what we were talking about. We were talking about why an American can support providing aid to Ukraine on moral grounds, and also on the grounds that it's geostrategically and economically in their best interests. And also, why that unjust? You keep saying justice doesn't exist and then start calling things you don't like unjust lol. Suppress an ability to escape is not okay. But suppressing other rights you mentioned can be okay.Rights such as? I'm getting the impression you hate the gays so I guess that's one. But how do you justify drawing that arbitrary line on what's \\"okay\\" and what's not okay within your moral relativist worldview? Why do you get to decide what rights are okay to violate and what right's aren't? And it is a main measure.Depends on what you're measuring. I would argue a country in which it is horrible to live where they commit horrific atrocities against their own people is not doing \\"well\\". Only one evil thing that China do is forbidding Uyghur and Tibetans to flee abroad and in some cases kill them outright. Other things, like suppressing opposition - it is neutral and it is their business.Killing them and forbidding them to free is a form of suppression on but okay. Again I question how you can say that within your moral relativist view. What if another country decides it's okay to genocide people? Who are you to decide what other countries do? It's not your family.But disregarding that, I take it you're okay with the social credit system? Would you be okay if your country implemented such a system? I don't care if you think it's \\"their business\\", that's not an actual statement on whether or not something's evil.","title":"CMV: Liberals cannot understand people with other political stance and vise versa."},{"text":"Yes and he brought back a very strong economy with low inflation that will be handed to trump.One problem, which Biden recently admitted, it that many of his infrastructure projects have taken too long to get started so many people haven't seen the full impact yet.","title":"CMV: Biden's term in office did not meaningfully deliver victories for the American left domestically"},{"text":"*citation missing.Trump inherited Obama's economy, ran it into the ground with poor policies like tax cuts for the wealthy, and then made poor decisions around covid that hurt the economy more than the pandemic already did.

Part of the provisions is that they would not be responsible for loans if they were defrauded. They have been waiting for loan discharges since 2015.For the second group, they have a permanent disability, covered under the Higher Education Act , TPD was added in 2021, that permits anyone who had a student loan that gets permanently disabled to discharge their student loan.For the third group, PSLF program was passed in 2007 under George Bush. The first round of eligible participants should have had their loans discharge in 2017 but found out that \\"qualifying payments\\" did not cover all loans or all payments. The program was tweaked under President Trump. Until then, only about 1% of public workers were actually eligible.

It's best not to think of this as an economic item but instead a national security one. [ Taiwan makes 90% of the world most advance chips and 68% of all chips world wide](https://www.wired.com/story/taiwan-makes-the-majority-of-the-worlds-computer-chips-now-its-running-out-of-electricity/#:~:text=One%20of%20them%2C%20the%20Taiwan,of%20all%20global%20chip%20production). Computational power is arguably the most important resource in the world right now. It's needed to run every aspect of the economy, as well as the military. China has long wanted to take over Taiwan for obvious historical reasons. If they did they would control the lion's share of all manufacturing for the planet. This would give them the ability to have their hardware in almost every house, every data center, and every military installation in the world. China would be dominant in any trade negotiation, and sanctions would be impossible because they would be too valuable. Obviously this is scary. This is why the US wants to onshore chip production so that they can ensure no foreign actor is able to leverage that against them. Even if we spend more then we get out (doubtful) it's still worth it for our national security. I think the biggest argument against the CHIP act is that it makes China invading Taiwan more likely. Because China is bigger and stronger than Taiwan, their strategy has been to be too valuable to the world so that if they are invading everyone will help. Having a near monopoly on chip production is part of Taiwan's national security, and by breaking that monopoly the world will find it more palatable if China does invade. Right now if China invades the US 100% would back them because they don't want the scenario I described to happen. However, if we have our own chip production and don't need Taiwan, that changes the calculus.","title":"CMV: Biden's term in office did not meaningfully deliver victories for the American left domestically"},{"text":"That is unconstitutional and holy fuck.

I grew up Christian, and agree with some of your points here.I disagree with your points about omnipotence, and omniscience, as this largely just seems like fun with words to me.The Bible never actually describes God as omnipotent, his omnipotence is an interpretation of the church, as a logical progression from things the Bible does say, like in Genesis where God created the Heavens and the Earth, or in James where it says he has authority over Satan and the demons, etc. From the perspective of highly limited human beings, a being who can accomplish such things is as good as omnipotent, but it is a title the Church put on him, not a claim made in the scriptures.Omniscience is similar. Again, God is described as the \\"God of Knowledge\\" in Samuel, or the \\"Lord Who Sees\\" in Genesis, but you won't find the word \\"omniscient\\" in the Bible. But, from a human perspective, if such a being exists, then it is as good as omniscient to us, so the description makes sense, but just remember, it's humans giving that title, not the scriptures themselves.All that said, I do believe in the existence of a creator God, but don't think the Bible or any other religious texts we have are actually his word.Ultimately, it doesn't make any sense to me that a deity capable of creating life and the world would entrust his holy word to something as flimsy as words on paper. Doing so makes them subject to issues with accurate transcription, interpretation into different languages, or fraudsters adding text that wasn't supposed to be there.The Bible is just a compilation of books from various authors that a group of Church officials once agreed constitute the holy scriptures. Who is to say that those fallible humans made the right call about which books to put in and which to leave out?My view is that God communicates to his creations through his creations, themselves. This may or may not be purposeful communication, but we have been given the cognitive ability to reason, and have been given tons of information about how to act.For a basic examples: We have the ability to think and examine the world around us. We can understand when we cause pain to others, and we have the ability to feel pain ourselves, knowing it to be unpleasant. By simple deductive reasoning, we can infer that we shouldn't hurt others, as a general rule.We have the capability of understanding that if we are God's creations, then so are other people, thus, we shouldn't do onto others as we would not want them to do unto us.I think all religions have a portion of understanding within them, like the Golden Rule from Christianity that I just expressed above, and those sorts of conclusions, in my view, ended up in those books because they were discoverable by examining the world around us with our logical mind, as opposed to being there before a God needed to spell that out to us.Science and philosophy are essentially the study of God's creation, and therefore, the study of God himself. Archeologists study ancient civilizations by looking at the things those civilizations created (eg. they look at the tools and creations of old cultures to piece together the lifestyle of those cultures). Essentially, science is the study of God, in the same way, by examining God's creation and using it to make hypothesis about the nature of the creator.","title":"CMV: God is definitely not real."},{"text":"When they decided to go into public service, was this program in place?","title":"Biden's total student debt relief passes $183 billion, after he forgives another 150,000 borrowers"},{"text":"You're being young and dramatic.

While some people might enjoy temporary benefits from this arrangement, the overhelming majority of people will get fucked over. I don't know why so many people convinced themselves that an economic system designed to concentrate wealth at the top will stop in its tracks to preserve their momentary privilege. It won't.

Posturing himself as \\"nothing will fundamentally change\\" candidate when he was running and attempting to distance himself from more progressive politicians in his own party, imo, subdued voters excitement for him on the left and forced him into a situation where he could not champion more left leaning ideas (even if he wanted) without hurting his campaign persona that was focused primarily on picking up moderates that had become disillusioned by trump. I would argue that this strategy worked for getting him elected, but inevitably tied his hands from actually accomplishing much or setting the stage for future liberal victories.

If they weren't paid higher then no one would volunteer to do them. This leads to wealth inequality and the richer people become the rich and the cycle continues.   \\nAlso don't read Sowell.

But I'll make my argument: Half his presidency was simply recovering from the shit-show that was Trump and the pandemic, and people love to forget that. He wasn't handed a thriving economy like Trump was, he was handed a flaming pile of you know what. The housing crisis? Trump removed the brakes in 2020 by dropping the fed rate to 0.05% and left the federal government with absolutely nothing to leverage to help with it moving forward. They made it so cheap to borrow that it sharply increased demand for mortgages at a time where supply was rock bottom. This triggered the never-ending increase that still hasn't stopped due to speculators, flippers, and people just planting their feet and demanding that \\"Yes, my home is worth 60% more than it was 4 years ago for some unknown reason.\\" Inflation? Not caused or fixable by the federal government. It's all corporate greed. We're looking at record profits EVERYWHERE. When there's record profits, and high inflation, a lot of that profit is because of just jacking up the price beyond what inflation would have deemed necessary, further adding to overall inflation. Aka: Take advantage and blame some \\"mysterious inflation\\" for your unnecessary price increases.

You'll see that with the other comments (currently zero but I haven't refreshed since I started writing this.)

The result was a historic victory: record low unemployment, strongest economy in world history, record low crime rates, fastest recovery from covid inflation of all nations in the world. The US rejoined climate change accords, redoubled efforts to invest in renewable energy, funded science-based legislation, strengthened ties with our allies, crippled the growing war machine of our historic enemies (who are the enemies of democracies everywhere), and put the United States in a position to be a world leader for peace and prosperity again.And look, if half a decade of health and wealth isn't enough, then what the f are we even doing?

What you're outlining is simply how social media engagement algorithms work, which is going to be pretty universal across countries at this point.However, the material conditions of working class Americans are just, so much worse than your average working class Dutch person. I'm not sure I need to elaborate but I can if you'd like. I don't pretend to know what life in the Netherlands is like exactly, but I do know your social programs and labor protections put ours to shame, and that's a big part of what I'm talking about.Couple the rapidly deteriorating material conditions with a political climate that is simply not even discussing a single thing that might help those material conditions, from any major political party, and you have a much different driver toward political radicalization.The shit we have to put up with in daily life is not ragebait, it's just enraging, and everyone who can do anything about it would seemingly rather we just die or disappear into the prison system.Unfortunately, Americans are uniquely terrible at political literacy as well. So a lot of the radicalization has been toward simply blaming whatever otherized group de jour is most expedient for the political ghouls.And the engagement algorithms of social media compound this. But they're far from the only thing going on. And not all radicalization is created equal. I would say we're at a point where the only ethical response to our situation IS radicalization, not because of out of context ragebait, but because we face numerous crises and our leaders are utterly unwilling to even acknowledge them.The type of radicalization borne out of deteriorating conditions and disenfranchisement is not new, the type borne out of engagement algorithms is.

Post some articles about native culture being destroyed: yeah right. Post about birth rates: couldnt care less. But, I am enraged by gimmicky variant covers on comic books. So, if you post an article on how many companies are bringing them back to boost sales Ill fly into a nerd rage as I was already semi-radicalized on this topic.","title":"CMV: online political radicalization mostly works using out-of-context ragebait"},{"text":"She said racist stuff about all israeli students, it was justified","title":"The amount of power Israel has over us..."},{"text":"The left tried to convince us that Joe Biden was a good and decent man.

It is the best metric psychologists and sociologists have for measuring psychological and predicting success, but that isn't because IQ is good.. it is because everything else to do with their \\"science\\" is nonsense.  It is the best out of the worst. And, ironically, what makes 'IQ correlate' is a lot of bad statistical math. Which is par for the course when dealing with anything with the sorts of \\"soft sciences\\". Namely if you eliminate the lowest performing portion of the IQ scale then the correlation with success goes pretty much random.  This is because the bottom end of the scale in IQ testing is dominated by people who are mentally ill or are suffering from other form of intellectual disability.  Nobody except academic psychologists should be surprised that a person suffering from Down Syndrome (etc) isn't going to perform well in the Army or as a professional in a corporate environment.  Eliminate the low performers like that and IQ pretty much becomes worthless.Which relates to why IQ became popularized in the USA. The Army started using IQ tests early on to filter out people who can't handle being in the military.  And in that case, as a sort of highpass filter that blocks the lowest quadrant, it is kinda useful. However we have something much better then IQ.In the real world we have a lot better metric.  it is called \\"past performance\\".   If you are successful in the past it is more likely you'll be successful in the future.  This takes into account all aspects of the human condition.... socio-economic profile, intelligence, \\"emotional intelligence\\", educational background, family life, drive, luck, morals, work ethic, etc etc. And what is more you don't have to depend on trying to figure out these things in terms of social groups.  It doesn't require academic studies to know it works. All this stuff matters only per individual, which is useful because it is the individual that actually matters. Not the groups. So caring about IQ is like trying to measure how good a baseball player is at baseball by measuring the size of his wrist or shoe size or whatever while ignoring their career statistics.  It is just nutty. We can do much better.---On a side note:The dirty secret about IQ is that it is primarily used as a therapeutic device.  Usually in children.When children get tested for IQ is usually because they are considered screw ups in some way.  Like they have speech problems, can't follow along in classes, tend to act out and cause problems and disruptions.  Stuff like that. And the point of the IQ test is try to figure out what is wrong with them. And in that situation is where the IQ test is most useful... because it isn't just the IQ score that maters, but it also takes into account a observer watching the child take the test.  The results from the observation is as important, or more important, then the results of the test itself. From this they can try to figure out if the kid is just bored because he is ahead of the rest of the class, or he has some sot of undiagnosed learning disability, parents are abusive or he has lousy diet, or can't sleep at night, or maybe just has ADD, or even that he has a hard time reading and nobody noticed vision problems before.  All these things impact the results of a actual IQ test and it requires a observer to try to figure it out.Which means that people that know their IQ and obsess over it often tend to be a bit \\"off\\".  Just because somebody scored high doesn't mean that they don't have other issues.","title":"How Anti Racism Policies become simple Racism and how the laws will always be unclear"},{"text":"You going to delete this comment too?","title":"Distinct possibility of Gaza ceasefire deal this week, top Biden official says"},{"text":"I didn't vote for that POS","title":"Trump admins question civil servants who they voted for"},{"text":"I mean you dont need to vilify students for a war they have no control over","title":"The amount of power Israel has over us..."},{"text":"Piss off fascist genocidal Nazi Israel and they'll have Trump impeached and removed by the end of the month.","title":"Trump Shares Video Revealing Netanyahu Got America Into War with Iraq and is Trying to Get US to War with Iran"},{"text":"Late night TV loses it over Trump saying. and then a bunch of late night hosts quotes.","title":"Kamala Harris posts Jimmy Carter funeral photo with notable exclusion; internet reacts"},{"text":"In Germany...

People today are oblivious. With that said, I would say the darkest period of time was the period preceding C-VID. People were absolutely lost, and I felt like society was moving in an absolute nihilist manner. After the pandemic, people in general seem more open and willing to question things. I know this is a hot take, but the pandemic in my opinion was generally a needed event for people to wake up.

I'm trying to figure out if you think the monarch should have power or just be a figurehead. Do you think UK monarchy as it currently as it currently exists is a model you would support? Or do you want the king to have more power? Why? But my point is you cannot assume this, because different people want different things. Your view is better to you, but not to me.Yeah but I don't live in this detached moral relativist world that you seem to. My view is better to me, and not you, and I think I'm right and you're wrong, and I'm not going to just say \\"oh we have a difference of opinion\\", I am going to fight for what I think is right and against what I think is wrong.I also think it's kinda funny that I, an atheist am taking the moral objectivist position here against you, a religious person you is taking a relativist position.  It is not good. But it is not your business if somebody not related to you suffer. If they ask for help - you may help, but that's it.This is again just a fundamentally selfish attitude that I can't be with. How are you defining someone as being \\"related to you\\"? Do you mean just your immediate family? Your nationality/race/ethnicity? What terms are we talking of in here and why do we draw the line there? Do we not all share a common identity of being human? I can understand this point. Yes, it is good for US, but majority of US citizens I saw online do not openly admit it. They try to give those conflict moral values, and not geopolitical ones.They don't have to be mutually exclusive. I think the U.S. led world system is a moral good for the world and economically beneficial to the U.S.  Because free will is way more important than universal rights. God gave us all free will, so, only God will judge in the end. There is no universal rights among humanity.But you yourself contradict that here- It is simple - if you have a war, you have a conflict. If you do a violent genocide, you are killing innocents. So, it is like fight and backstab. While fighting is not so good, but in some cases necessary. But backstab is way more evil.How could genocide be evil if it not a violation of peoples' human rights? How are you determining who and who is not an innocent and if it's okay to kill them if it's all subjective? If I want to commit a genocide, why can't I say \\"Your view that genocide wrong is better to you, but not to me.\\"?  Depends on what we define \\"oppression\\". In some cases I would agree, but in some cases I would not.The malicious or unjust treatment of, or exercise of power over, a group of individuals, often in the form of governmental authority. For example the suppression of peoples' rights, freedom of speech, freedom of movement, etc. China now doing well, better than most countries.China is doing well on the geopolitical stage (sort of anyway, it's more complicated than a lot of people think but I don't wanna get sidetracked) but they treat their people terribly.

It makes sense why they tried to structure as much as they could in such a way that few entities could sue them due to standing rules. The original promise was that Biden would sign legislation forgiving $10K of loans. Activists then made it sound so easy to just write these loans off without Congress, leading to the current predicament where people feel misled.  The Administration probably should have been more forceful in acknowledging their limitations without Congress. Its clear now that throwing things against a wall and seeing what sticks isn't a great strategy (although it might still be the best one they had).The Biden Administrations reform efforts for student loans (both the ones enacted and those they attempted but had rebuffed in the Courts) really didn't address the exorbitant cost of higher education. It should seriously not cost as much as it does.

I tried to explain those in other answers. I think my culture's view on human rights is better than other cultures',But my point is you cannot assume this, because different people want different things. Your view is better to you, but not to me.  Do you think people suffering is a bad thing? It is not good. But it is not your business if somebody not related to you suffer. If they ask for help - you may help, but that's it. Russia asserting dominance over Eastern Europe, NATO collapsing, and the world moving back towards a multipolar geopolitical system would be a disaster for us. I can understand this point. Yes, it is good for US, but majority of US citizens I saw online do not openly admit it. They try to give those conflict moral values, and not geopolitical ones. Oh wait so you believe in god? How can you say natural/universal human rights don't exist?? Because free will is way more important than universal rights. God gave us all free will, so, only God will judge in the end. There is no universal rights among humanity. I don't see why you're drawing the line there, seems a little arbitrary.It is simple - if you have a war, you have a conflict. If you do a **violent** genocide, you are killing innocents. So, it is like fight and backstab. While fighting is not so good, but in some cases necessary. But backstab is way more evil.

I need to love liberal democracy instead of executive form of constitutional monarchyWait wait what? Are you an actual monarchist or do you just like constitutional monarchy? Do you think monarchs should actually wield effective political power, or do you support constitutional monarchies? Because if it's the latter, you do realize you support liberal democracy, right? The UK, Belgium, Netherlands, Sweden, Japan etc. are all liberal democracies. Do you understand/accept this? So, here is a short summary of my political views: There is no \\"natural and universal human rights\\". All human rights is given to us by a state and ingrained in a culture, and there will be no rights without a state.I generally agree with this.  Different cultures has different beliefs in human rights, so one culture can view something as right, but other is not.I also agree this is true. However, you seem to think that means these things are neutral, which is a strange conclusion that I disagree with. I think my culture's view on human rights is better than other cultures', and the promotion of my values and the suppression/supersession of barbaric backward values is a tangible good as it measurably increases global well-being and rights for people around the world. Anything is a state's business, not world one. This is a meaningless statement. States are part of the world.   If you are strong enough, you can try to subjugate other state to force it to stop - but what is the point? I mean, on one very basic level the point can be to prevent harm. If there are people who are unjustly suffering in the world, is it not a moral good to try to stop that suffering? Do you think people suffering is a bad thing?  You need to have some profit from it. You do. The vast majority of the time anyway. For example, the United States has a vested interest in backing the people of Ukraine and limiting Russian power, because the United States-led world system in which we protect global trade has been a massive success not just for humanity, but for the United States as well. It makes a ton of money. It's why we're the biggest economy in the world and the most powerful country in the world. Russia asserting dominance over Eastern Europe, NATO collapsing, and the world moving back towards a multipolar geopolitical system would be a disaster for us. But aside from a state business, there is some recommendations written in Testaments, which recommended by God Himself, and you can morally justify to intervene to other country if they are systematically against this recommendations (like violent genocides). Oh wait so you believe in god? How can you say natural/universal human rights don't exist?? Doesn't god love everybody? Why do you say genocide is wrong, isn't that just a subjective thing dictated to us by a state and ingrained in our culture? But mere wars and other violent conflicts did not justify an intervention.I don't see why you're drawing the line there, seems a little arbitrary. But yes I agree not every war necessarily justifies an intervention, but it can, depending on the specifics in the ground, humanitarian concerns, and what our interests are. I see no issues in a dictatorships in authoritarian states. They can be as good as democratic ones, and as bad as democratic ones too.Do you generally think people being oppressed is a bad thing? This and other questions I'm asking aren't rhetorical by the way, I'd genuinely like to know. What are some dictatorships/authoritarian states you would name that are \\"as good\\" as liberal democracies?Overall your point seems to be about people \\"not understanding\\", and just calling you a \\"bigot\\" or a \\"moron\\". My final question is- do you not think that's possible? Like, do you not think bigotry and stupidity exist in the world. Because (and I seriously do not mean this as an insult) I think your political worldview as you've laid it out here sounds quite dumb, and if someone thinks that I don't think it's wrong for them to say it. It doesn't mean they don't understand you. People can understand that a worldview is dumb. But if you don't think I have a good understanding of your views please answer the questions I asked here, because I'd really like to know more.","title":"CMV: Liberals cannot understand people with other political stance and vise versa."},{"text":"It has always been the intent of the government to obscure military expenditures.The GDP is itself a misleading metric that includes government and defense spending within it.

If the limit is supposedly not important, why the need for it? Germany should decide for itself whether it would ever want to increase/decrease it's army2. Russia and China's threats are absolutely the reason Europe SHOULD massively boost it's military strength. Especially with how immoral the US is, and how finicky it is. Currently Europe has to basically tow whatever line the US wants us to, simply because we rely on them to an unhealthy degree for protection. If the US decided one day to stop that, we would be fucked. That's not a situation I particularly want to live in. Having to choose a lesser evil to protect us against a greater evil when we easily have the resources to protect ourselves.3. No, lack of military isn't what made Germany a \\"beacon of democracy\\". Denazification was. Having a strong army or not doesn't change anything about that, this isn't the 50s anymore. Nations change, their social structures change. Alliances change. Britain and France went from being some of the most at odds arch nemeses in history to being a close alliance against Germany in the early 20th century. Germany has shown absolutely no reason why it shouldn't be \\"trusted\\". If anything it should be the other way around, the US, with it's millions of civilian massacres throughout the cold war, should be limiting it's strength, not the nation that has not shown any inkling of acting immorally since 1945.Germany being europe's strongest economy isn't stopping Russia from invading a European country. That's the key issue. Russia is poorer than South Korea but is able to boss around the world, why? Because it has a large army and nukes.Foreign policy that amounts to \\"we shouldn't provoke pariah states, no matter how unfair that is\\" is EXACTLY the mentality that led to the Nazis doing what they did. Imagine if you were to say that Britain shouldn't have increased it's military because it might \\"provoke France\\".

The world does not need to be about war. If cultures within France got destroyed its not that they were too weak and therefore deserved it. Some of it was unjust forceful imposition of the newly created French culture, some of it was willing transition probably. The first is to be condemned the second is neutral.?\\nStates need not be about armies and force. Yes, to some level, per definition we say a state has a monopoly of force, criminal law is the ultima ratio and many hold that people should be obligated to serve in the military if needed. But that is a bleak outlook kf that's what you think a state is for, nowdays it can be about welfare, about progress, a better life for everyone. Most of the world has left behind expansionist notions. Sure, some places need to be prepared to defend themselves but that not something that every other policy needs to follow.\\nAnd regarding armies and democracy. It's a pretty recent thing thaf armies are almost totally top down. There used to be elected officers still in WW1. Not to mention how feudal armies were or the Romans who had a mix of bottom up and top down. In fact, they were a militaristic society where the proto democratic notions they had was heavily tied to the military. Israel is also a heavily militaristic country. But many other countries have a professional army instead of a militia, which is just a tool, and not really something that is at one with the people.\\n\\"You don't trust a monarch, however good their education to decide.\\" I think i explained that one in the same comment.

So, for example, Finnish government and culture should serve you as long as you are Finnish and want to give birth to more Finnish people.\\"\\nAgain, we are talking of different paradigms but the good thing about liberal democracy is that no, you can expect the Finnish government to serve you in its function as a secular government no matter who you are. In fact, even if you are outright hostile to what Finland stands for it will tolerate you right up until the point you do serious things to undermine it, and even then, mostly proportionally (it will be justice, not revenge, it will be incapacitation, not extermination etc). Although basically all states have a history and some level of basic cohesion based on some professed culture, a liberal democrat would not approach a state in that way primarily - those are mostly tolerable remnants of history.The state should serve the individual regardless of culture, or maybe by a very minimal definition of shared concepts of human rights (or at least what we hope almost everyone at some point will accept as such). You don't need to leave if you don't want to be a part of dominant culture. You can create your own culture. Cultures can be something people engage with freely on top of the shared minimal values like fundamental rights, since that's what can allow it to be that way.\\nI don't know how to get to to change your thinking to the liberal democratic paradigm, but maybe the first step has to do mostly with outlook:\\n-liberal democracy is optimistic, aspiring, liberating, curious, trusting, values individuality etc\\n-hobbesianism, realpolitik, facsism and others (not all the same? are pessimistic about human nature, about the future, don't really value individuality, don't think in terms of trust, but 0 sum games, view many things as threats that liberals wouldn't and while being pessimistic maybe are even unwilling to do sisyphusian things to make it better\\nNow sometimes liberal democracies make mistakes too, but not only to non liberal states do possibly way more mistakes on a state-interest level, but at the same time their subjects are probably way more unhappy tha citizens of liberal democracies.\\nI mean I would rather have the liberal democracy even if it implodes once in a while (and try to perfect that, so it doesn't) than all the alternatives that seem to implode way more often and violently but even when they don't they are pretty bad for everyone and I see no value in keeping them alive (not to have at least a gradual transition to democracy, if immediate is not feasible or wise)","title":"CMV: Liberals cannot understand people with other political stance and vise versa."},{"text":"She seemed to be doing a great job right after Biden stepped aside and endorsed her.

Yeah, labor in a given field is subject to supply and demand shifts which increase or decrease the wages paid.  That's just how things work.But at the same time the general consensus of economics is \\"a rising tide raises all ships\\" IE the \\"lump of labor fallacy\\" in which, in aggregated, labor produces value meaning it increases the total and per capita wealth of all involved.  If not through direct compensation, then in lower prices of goods so that the same dollar you earned goes farther than it would, thus making you richer.Now the caveats?1. When it comes to the \\"low-skill immigration\\" you're talking about?  The counterfactual is that, in theory, if this low-skill immigration didn't exist and thus wages had to rise to meet the supply needs?  It would become uncompetitive to the point of failure.  A tomato that costs twice as much to get on store shelves is one that won't sell and will end the firm.  In practice, we suppose that American Agrobusiness without this labor... just ceases to exist outside of niche applications.  Maybe that's not the case of course, maybe it'd just be marginally more expensive but still exist.2. Yes the lump of labor fallacy is a fallacy, but there isn't a magic money fairy that makes it so all wages in every industry go up.  Some lose, some win, in finding equilibrium.  And globally, free trade makes us all richer, but that doesn't mean every single person gets richer.  How much shifts actually occur depends a lot, but probably isn't to the extreme level you said. Or maybe that's the case, who knows.That's why I mentioned the Maoist-Third-Worldists here, their whole bit being the \\"Labor Aristocracy\\" IE: American and other First-World Workers make \\"Super-Profits\\" that push their wages up off the exploitation of the Global South.  Put another way, a world without American Hegemony and policy that benefit American Workers has the world getting richer as a whole while Americans get poorer.

I do believe there is a god, but he probably just isnt of the same nature those religions described him to be.?In regards to the being created by chance argument, however, I believe it is perfectly possible to be created by chance. Let me explain:How likely is it that the first clumps of matter that would ever form the first living beings would ever form them? Very very unlikely. But wait. The universe is really old. And when I say old I dont mean millions of years, I mean billions of years (13.8 billion). That time period is so unfathomably long that we cant even begin to imagine how long it is. But that longer time period also means that theres a much higher likelihood that events of extremely low chance can actually happen. Okay, that bumps up the likelihood, but its still nothing crazy. But then theres also the fact that the universe is so unimaginably wide (93 billion light years wide. For context, light can travel around the whole world 7.5 times in one second, but it takes light 8 whole minutes to get to the sun and would take light over 4 years to get to the nearest star. The fact that it would take light 93 billion years to cross the observable universe is crazy enough. There are so many planets littered in this space that it really really really bumps up those chances. Okay so we went from very very unlikely to very unlikely after the time analysis. Now weve gone from very unlikely to unlikely from the observable universe analysis. But then theres the even crazier fact that nobody knows how big the actual universe is. Some have estimated it to be 7 trillion light years across which is absolutely mind blowing.?Imagine youre throwing a dice and your goal is to land it on the 6th face 1 million times in a row. Increasing the time you have (opportunities to throw the dice) would make it more likely you could achieve this goal.

Garland should have been fired when it became clear less than a year in that his primary focus was restoring normalcy, well Im sorry to say but normalcy is dead and it died on Election Day in 2016. Trump and all his associates and coconspirators needed to be aggressively prosecuted including the members of the House and Senate who were almost certainly involved but instead we went after the foot soldiers who will probably all be pardoned now anyway. They never found the person who set the pipe bombs despite DC being under heavy surveillance but they did manage to find Luigi Mangione somehow. The whole thing is a joke. People care about democracy I think in that most dont want to live under a totalitarian dictatorship but the Democratic Party elites kept saying Trump was a threat to democracy and yet all of their actions said otherwise. They continued to work with Republicans who were almost certainly involved to some degree with the insurrection, allowed Trumps prosecution to be slow walked, other than the Electoral Count Act reform they passed no legislation to address problems in voting or to codify many of the norms of the presidency that Trump violated. Nothing was done to reign in the presidency or Supreme Court. They could have required ethics rules to be binding on both. They could have required presidents to divest their finances, share their tax returns, undergo public mental and physical health testing. They could have passed laws ensuring certain people couldnt be fired at a whim, protected the civil service from F series. Restore the Voting Rights Act, expand the Civil Rights Act. They did none of it. Some of that is because Manchin was practically a Republican and Sinema was sold to corporate overlords.

Especially as change can be disruptive. A leader in power for a long time may not see the need for change. It's an extreme example, but look at somebody like Hitler who came to power on a massive wave of popular support, then by 1944 or 1945 had lost a lot of that. Any views should be respected, if you try to chat. I would try to respect foreigner, even if he would openly said than he want to destroy my country. As long as chat is peaceful - it is okay to him to have those views.I suppose this is semantics over what is meant by respect. But broadly we agree. In your example you would listen to the person who hates your country, but what then? Would you feel obligated to support him, or not disagree with him?  In your example replace you with most people in the West, and replace the extremist with you and you will see me point. You can believe these things, but nobody is obligated to see them as sensible, credible or practical. Them telling you they disagree with you or don't respect your positions is them expressing their own opinion. Which they have a right to as much as you do.

While my views is more right-wing than mainstream, but I see no issues with understanding and tolerating my views at home, at least some of them.Ah see you mentioned the West so I focused on that. Where are you from? It's cultural differences in action. I can understand it for USA, but fail to understand it for Poland or Britain, for example. Is Kiepling forgotten? Churchill?I don't follow your point I'm afraid. I don't know a lot about Kipling. But Churchill is generally seen as a divisive figure who was the right man for the job at the time. He undeniably played a major part in our success in WW2, but there is more awareness now of his politics aside from that being controversial. He was an unashamed advocate for Empire (not uncommon at the time but the view of the Empire is  more nuanced now) and a bit of an adventurist with big unrealistic ideas sometimes, especially during WW2. I'm British so don't know enough about Poland to follow your comment there.

The whole system has been corrupted by messed up incentives.Government backed loans means that a bank is going to give any 17-18 year old idiot that walks in a loan for college with zero concern for whether or not that kid will reliably pay the loan back. Meaning some 17 year old yahoo with \\"the concept of a plan\\" as they like to quote, can walk in, ask for mountains of money to get a degree in underwater basket weaving, and walk out with a loan. No questions asked. The first, obvious effect of this is that a ton of people are taking on huge debt to get degrees that will not put them in a position to be able to repay that debt. The second, less obvious effect is that colleges are going to get their money no matter what. They can jack up the price as high as they like, and they'll get it because the students have a seemingly infinite supply of loans behind them. They don't have to keep prices reasonable because they'll never reach a point where the price is too high when students can keep getting loans for whatever the school charges. They can also lower quality of product and still get that money, in part, because those kids are backed by \\"free money\\" as too many of them see it and in part because of reasons below.Now, this has massively inflated the number of people with college degrees in the job market. That causes two big problems. For one, it dilutes the value of that college degree. Supply and demand. The supply of college graduate job candidates has risen much faster and higher than demand for them. It also means that for almost anything but entry level and trade jobs, a degree has become a baseline. Which leaves many kids feeling as if they CAN'T get a somewhat decent (quality and pay) job without that degree. Which is another reason colleges can spike prices and skimp on quality and students will still show up and pay the huge amount. They're convinced they HAVE to do it or \\"spend the rest of their life flipping burgers\\" as parents of millennials always said.","title":"Everything we say about you is right, we cant be wrong, long live democracy .

I had this conversation with my wife last night. In our lifetimes we can hope to have on the order of $1-10 million in assets. That is 1, 000 times less than a billionaire. I think over a lifetime, about $1 million is assets is achievable by rhe average western family, especially if we are just rounding and using orders of magnitude.The worlds poor are likely not to ever have more that $1,000 in assets, if any at all. If you make $2 a day, over the course of 60 years of working you will have made $40,000... Over your whole life. The difference between the average western family and the worlds poor is also 1000 times.The difference in wealth between a billionaire?and an average western family is the same order of magnitude as between the average western family and the worlds poor. The worlds poorest people are even poorer than that. There is literal slavery in this world and we haven't talked about access to developed resources that we have that the worlds poor do not, like roads, hospitals, schools, etc. I feel quite confident in saying that in terms of wealth, there is a smaller gap between a billionaire and the average western family than there is between the average western family and the worlds poor.*edit the replies below are missing the forest through the trees here. Firstly, \\"especially if we are just rounding and using orders of magnitude\\". The numbers $500,001 through $5,000,000 are all on the same order of magnitude as $1,000,000. Secondly, even if we drop this one order of magnitude and say the average western only makes $100,000 (aka $50,001 to $500,000) in their life time, it really does not change that much and this number is 100% justified as the median and mean wealth (not just boomers) in every western country is greater than $50,000. This actually starts to extend into developing nations as well. The world's poor have nothing. The average member of the world's poor are at least as far away as the average westerner is from a billionaire (or if you want a hundred millionaire). The point here is to try and put into perspective the gulf in wealth between a member of the worlds poor and the average western.But, to re-iterate, we have not even taken into account access to developed resources. As an example, my wife and I were discussing someone in poverty in Canada. My wife is a doctor and had seen this person 3 times in the last month for various ailments including abortion and reproductive services. This person lives in arctic Canada and has access to a home with heating and has access to food regularly. This individual is signifigantly better off than a member of the worlds poor whom makes less that $2 a day. Again, that individual will earn about $40,000 over their entire life at that wage. This poor Canadian accessed more that $40,000 in medical services over the past month. Something this member of the world's poor would never see in their lifetime.To summarize, \\"I do not think the average person truly understands how poor the worlds poor are.\\"","title":"Why the MAGA Fight Over H-1B Visas Is Crossing Party Lines: Critics from the left and the right say Big Tech companies are exploiting the visa system for high-skilled workers to reduce labor costs and boost profits"},{"text":"Sort of like the illegal crime syndicate the Brits created.

The medical field has been taken over by money making entities and they have jacked up the costs to do more, plus the middle men of insurance (which adds people and bloat to the system). Things don't actually cost that much to do or make, they have a crazy markup. One that just gets passed down the line from corpo entity to insurer to person - and guess what the first two make money.Look at drugs and medical, actually. I bet you aren't aware of the drug insurance scheme run by companies. They basically make shell companies saying \\"ah I don't owe you money, Shell A does.\\" Then shell A says it's B, etc. By the time you move down the list to recoup your cost, the company doesn't exist and lots of time has passed. CVS was a victim of this, many pharmacies are. Many people are too, the insurance companies charge the person and the company, they double dip. People want to be accountable for their debt. They don't want to be held hostage in an unmanageable situation with no way out that drains resources from going to otherwise useful growth endeavors.","title":"Medical debt banned from credit reports by new Biden administration rule"},{"text":"This is always how they do it.

Basically every culture arose like that.\\nYou can respect the good and neutral, and even the possibly bad aspects of their culture while condemning the condemnable part of said culture.\\nIt doesn't make much sense to say members of a culture can try change their own culture with new (or old) ideas of that culture as long as it's not foreign. What does it matter if a foreign culture also has something similar? You can lift the best parts of other cultures, they don't have dibs on it.?\\nOn the first point, I don't think that's something a state should be actively involved in, or if yes, then either straightforwardly or through other nudges, that are secular. But I am not even sure that religion is the only way to do that. Religion seems effective mostly because of the most fundamentalist types have the most children. Moderates far less so. Also, demographic shifts are far more a consequence of other factors, which muddle the data. But even if the data was free of these problems, a correlation wouldn't be causation. The people who don't agree with a religion, and demands made by that religion (such as pressure to procreate) are more likely to leave. Similarly there is a bias of who wants to join.\\nOtherwise, the whole point of liberal democracy (as opposed to fascism for example) is that while you accept that society as a whole may have some interests, goals (hence, democracy and not anarchy), there is at least a balance, if not a clear favoring of the individual (hence, liberal). You can make policies in the public sphere, and there might be a public debate on where the line is between that and the private sphere, but you should generally err towards private. A lot of it not just because members of a culture agree, but because of practical considerations. You don't trust a monarch, however good their education to decide. You don't just have a hierarchical setup for information. You have individuals with freedom of conscience, freedom of speech etc who can debate and let their voices heard, overall it will mean power will have to be more responsive. You see the messiness of democracy and think it's unstable. Well, for the most part, the more democracy, actually the more stability. Never is it 100% stable but more representativity is better, at least there are processes from bottom. Anything like that in a top-down system built on too much deference might seem stable, until the tipping point when it's not.\\nOn a more philosophical level. Cultures don't have feelings. Nations don't have feelings. People have feelings. First and foremost society should serve the people in it, not some abstract entity. Sure, there might be feedback loops, where do do better for people you need to defend institutions, but those institutions should serve the people, who actually count.

Meaning TikTok viewers were definitively exposed to more pro-Palestine propaganda than any other social media. And with that knowledge comes the question how bad would that ratio be skewed to a pro-China position compared to a pro-US position when the feared Taiwan conflict begins. Of course many politicians do not want to overtly admit its about controlling propaganda. Its understandable from a Machiavellian sense, but that would mean people understand nuance in this world.","title":"Mark Kelly says he is aware TikTok ban is controversial, yet there is national security risk to' app"},{"text":"You do realize Israel is taking Christian land too right?","title":"The amount of power Israel has over us..."},{"text":"Google \\"Satanic panic\\"   this isn't new","title":"Anyone else noticed this trend?"},{"text":"Hasn't this always been the go-to tactic?
