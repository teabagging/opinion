In other countries it might be different, radical islamist countries might call me evil and then kill me, radical anti-islamists might call the islamists evil and then kill them for what they preach.Morality is not a science, there is no end goal where you prove one moral position \\"invalid\\" and then you win. Even if other side has the might to give them the \\"right\\" to silence it's critics, from a safe distance you can still call them wrong, there is no rule against it other than the proactical difficulties of doing so, and if you are clever enough about it you might end up gaining power and imposing your own ideals on them in turn.There is no *logical argument* that invalidates fascists, or liberals, or zionists, or islamists, or anarchists, or communists, or any other belief, if you believe strongly enough that they are evil and a danger to you then you either have to kill them, or switch to an ideology that tolerates them but allows for marginalizing them.Or if you think that their strongly held beliefs are *equal to yours*, then *you don't actually hold yours*, you have to give up your own and switch to a neutral nihilism that states that your former beliefs have no more value than your formerly hated ones.","title":"CMV: - Modern/Liberal/Westernised Muslims have no right to criticise the implementation of Sharia law by the Taliban as morally or ethically 'wrong'"},{"text":"Nevada Democrat here.

As to why the left wing in the US is aligned with the equivalent of a Dick Cheyney Warmonger/Trump corruptionalist right wing Netanyahu government in Israel, I don't know. Well, it's campaign donations, so I do. My personal guess is that Netanyahu is deliberately goading a war to create political instability for the democrats, in order to help Trump win. You have Trump, the corporate media, the military industrial complex, vs left voters that want nothing to do with Netanyahu, and are disgusted with his actions. This sets up conflict with the large muslim democratic population base in Michigan, for example. I expect Israeli actions will become even more provocative in what's left till the election. By contrast, Iran and Lebanon have been relatively restrained in their responses - they have populations that are demanding retaliation, but they have opted for \\"show\\" strikes of minimal severity.

You then say internationalism has failed (not that it is a good or bad thing). If you are saying nationalism is bad but successful, then how is it successful? Is it more successful than internationalism? In what way?I would argue nationalism is successful in terms of being able to crowd out alternative ideologies (such as the ones you mention). Internationalism has then failed because it cannot compete with nationalism as an organizing ideology for states and peoples. However, there is another sense of failure too: nationalism has failed as it has not brought peace. Internationalism has succeeded as it has, when it has prevailed over nationalism, brought wars to an end. You also note different kinds of internationalism. It is obvious that some kinds of internationalism are opposed to other kinds. (There are also lots of kinds of nationalists, but if we skip over this with generalizations for now, we can focus on internationalism). Post-Soviet economic globalization was a form of (neo)liberal internationalism that was actually supported by nationalists and opposed by defenders of human rights, environmental and social justice, Indigenous peoples etc. Neoconservative preemptive wars and wars of retribution can also be considered to be a form of (neocolonial) internationalism with support from proud nationalists in many countries. It is only more recently that nationalist and internationalist discourses seem to have diverged, with the far right now opposing neoconservative wars and neoliberal globalization as not providing sufficient benefits to the nations that were pushing them, while constraining their autonomy. If you look at the global economic institutions like the WTO, it appears like the rules that previously entrenched the rights of primarily western corporations and constrained the rights of states to protect their economies, social safety nets and environments, now also empower Chinese and other non-western corporations and constrain the ability of western governments to legally resist them. The rise of China and more widely the BRICS also point to a shift to a more multipolar world, where international institutions will no longer be designed based on a US-led western consensus. Nationalists in western countries are therefore shifting to different forms of internationalism seemingly based on forming blocs and bilateral negotiations, which still undermine full national sovereignty, but also help achieve some economic self-interests, maintain elite power within countries or achieve nativist nationalist goals in new ways. Part of this means trying to undermine human rights and economic conventions built up over previous periods of nationalist internationalisms built up during the Cold War or during the post-Soviet Washington Consensus. So I would argue that internationalisms continue to coexist with nationalisms. That the more successful (powerful/actually implemented) internationalisms are the ones that gain support from nationalist actors, while the unsuccessful ones tend to be those which are opposed by nationalists.","title":"Cmv: Internationalism has failed."},{"text":"I pinch myself.","title":"You wake up on November 6th and his is the result of the election, how do you react?"},{"text":"Get the fuck in !!

In the small scales, yea Texas blocking its border makes sense but we have to emphasize that Texas is one state in the country of United States. Texas acting on its own affects politics/ outlook of the country. Remember Texas is one state who is taking action against a whole country Mexico. Having state law trump the federal law is a slippery slope which Im sure we can agree is ideally not something we have to deal with.

You claim that   Modern/Liberal/Western have no right to criticize  the Taliban based on not your understanding how one interpretation could be better than the other. You also claim that as a non-Muslim it is not your place to judge the merits of interpretations of Islam. Yet in making your first claim, you are in effect making a judgement about the merits of different interpretations of Islam, are in effect claiming that the Modern/Liberal/Western interpretations have no greater merit than the Talibans interpretations, and are in effect claiming that those people dont have the legitimacy to debate how their own religion is interpreted. Just because you do not personally understand the reasoning behind why they regard their interpretations of Islam to be better than that of the Talibans does not that their assertions do not have merit or that they dont have standing to make the case for their interpretations. To address the matter of how one interpretation can be regarded as better than another, it is important to recognize that while different people may interpret something differently, that does not mean that the different interpretations hold equal merit. Quite often different interpretations have different degrees of merit. Some interpretations can be based on sound reasoning and analysis, the application of sound concepts, and factually accurate information. While others may be based on faulty reasoning, poor analysis, false concepts, or incorrect information. In general, trying to discern which interpretations have more or less merit involves working to be well informed about what ideas, information, and reasoning went into different interpretations and analyzing them to see how they hold up. Considering the merits of different religious interpretations is a complex topic. It can involve theological, philosophical, historical, and literary analysis. For these, key considerations can include what teachings/stories/writings should be considered the canonical works of a religion? What other works beyond the core canon should be considered consistent/ beneficial supplementary materials? What key values and ethical principles do these works express about how people should worship and live their lives? What aspects of religious stories should be regarded descriptive of things that are said to have happened and what aspects should be regarded as prescriptive for how followers should live their lives? What practices do or not embody the key values and ethical principals of the religion? How should these values and principals apply in various real life scenarios? And of the guidelines that come from these considerations, which should be regarded as more contextual and which be regarded as applying more universally? By looking at how these and other considerations are handled by these different interpreters of the religion, one can gain more of a sense as to how other Muslims would contend that the Talibans interpretation is wrong. Those include contentions that the Talibans interpretation mixes in wrong concepts in a way that warps their understanding of the religion, that it asserts things to be key values or principals of the religion that should not be regarded as such, that it misinterprets how certain values should be applied, that it promotes practices that go against what should be regarded as key values and principals of the religion, that it promotes practices that are by virtue of their qualities and implications immoral, and that it distorts interpretations of certain aspects of the religion in self-serving attempts at justifying practices that followers of the religion may otherwise see as wrong. Additionally, there are broader philosophic contentions, where the supports of certain interpretations may look at the broader ethical and moral implications of competing interpretations. Where they contend that the values and principles  they propound have good reason be regarded as being true and embodying moral qualities, that the practices they promote well embody those values and principles, and are beneficial to humanity. That on that basis, their interpretation would be regarded as more consistent with the idea of a righteous god and therefore should be considered as a better interpretation of a religion. This type of argument can be seen among those that contend that an interpretation of Islam that supports equal rights and decent treatment of women is a better interpretation than the Talibans more repressive interpretation.","title":"CMV: - Modern/Liberal/Westernised Muslims have no right to criticise the implementation of Sharia law by the Taliban as morally or ethically 'wrong'"},{"text":"Like how fucked is it that \\"let's implement The Purge\\" is the charitable interpretation *fuck*","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Look at my coalition dawg, we're getting a no-confidence vote!","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Can you name any current house or senate member who would be relevant against Trump?If MTG, Gaetz, *and* Boebert came out against Trump tomorrow -- do you think it would make any difference come Election Day?","title":"Republican Jeff Flake endorses Kamala Harris, says 'she's ready' for the job"},{"text":"We are way behind.

This is because almost all of the oil he sold was already mandated by law to be sold, before he even became president.The big thing he changed is that he took legally required sales scheduled for 2024-2027 and rescheduled them into a lot of sales all in 2022.In the short term, this early execution of sales lowers the SPR below expected levels for this year. However, as the next few years pass, those sales would have happened anyway. If no more sales or purchases are made beyond the legally required ones, the SPR is already set to be at approximately the same level in October 2027 as was expected before Biden was even elected.Even back in 2018, the coming SPR drain was clear:[https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=35032](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=35032)Also, I'm skeptical that Trump will refill the SPR. He was a big proponent of the movement to drain the SPR back when these SPR draining laws were being passed. Back in 2017, Trump told us the SPR was a waste of money because we produce so much oil domestically, and he asked Congress to drain it faster and deeper than was planned at the time. Of course, we produce significantly more oil domestically now than when he made that justification for draining the SPR.","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris is likely to win the presidential race, but to solidify her chances and beat Trump decisively, she should also focus on issues that resonate with young, white men."},{"text":"It also includes people who are still serving sentences.

It's one thing to be an accelerationist and believe that Trump will destroy the system so much that we'll be able to build it back with good Leftist policies (which has not been borne out by recent history, but is not impossible) and it's another to say that \\"Democrats too are awful and there should be criticism of both of them\\" (which is undeniably true), but this post is actually implying \\"Trump is the better choice of the two in terms of his actual policy and the threat level he poses,\\" which is utter insanity.

I find it difficult to understand the basis of your argument other than vague vibes.For example, why is it that you focus on modern or liberal or westernised Musilims as exclusively the ones who have no right to criticise the Talibans laws? Is it equally wrong for you to do so? Is it not equally wrong for traditionalist conservative Afghan Muslims to do so? What gives you the authority to be the arbiter of who can and cannot criticise who and on what basis?It doesnt sound to me that you think there is something particularly hypocritical or wrong with being a modern or liberal or westernised Muslim in general. Or is that one of your premises?It doesnt sound like you have done a great deal of research into Islam and believe the Taliban have the most reasonable interpretation of the ideas in the Quran and/or hadiths. Or is that one of your premises?It does sound a bit like you think that being Muslim is irrelevant, and that being modern, liberal, or western (however you define those terms) makes it illegitimate to criticise a group which is not any of those things in your opinion. Do you have the same problem in principle with a western Muslim and a non-western Muslim criticising one another? Why would you want to take the right from the western Muslim to criticise the non-western Muslim alone, and not the right for the non-western Muslim to criticise the western one?Also it is unclear to me whether you think a liberal non-western Muslim would have the right to criticise a conservative western Muslim. You seem to me to lump these broad ideas together in a very idiosyncratic way based on vibes rather than any reasoning I can follow to make a logical argument for or against it.I am not even sure what you mean by a right to criticise. Should there be legal repercussions on someone for someone who does something they have no right to do? Or should they be shamed? Or should they be censored? It sounds to me you maybe mean something else, like that people have the right to criticise each other, but you personally dont take this particular group seriously when they do so.It seems like you arent willing to go deeply into their reasoning, but you assume that they came to their conclusions due to some kind of indoctrination into western liberalism or desire to fit in. Perhaps you expressed yourself badly and you have discussed this deeply with your Muslim friends and you were unimpressed with the depth of their reasoning. However, you go on to make a relativist argument which is much broader, as if there is no argument they could make that would be legitimate, because they have different cultural backgrounds from those you imagine support the Taliban in Afghanistan.

It really has to be analyzed on a case by case basis much like the consumption of alcohol or junk food, neither of which are inherently beneficial for the society.Porn isn't always a depiction of consensual sex like you make it out to be, there are a lot of scenes containing aggression where the female is almost always the target. Consent in porn is dubious and just 'assumed'. A lot more women report getting choked/slapped/ surprise anal when they have sex with their male partners without prior consent to such acts in the recent years with the rise of such acts being mainstream in porn.[stats](https://theconversation.com/sexual-strangulation-has-become-popular-but-that-doesnt-mean-its-wanted-239235)[one of the effects of 'extreme' porn becoming normalized](https://endsexualexploitation.org/articles/institutions-of-higher-violence-the-influence-of-pornography-on-college-sexual-assault/)[dubious consent in porn and how it manifests into real life consent](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://scholarworks.smith.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi%3Farticle%3D2036%26context%3Dtheses&amp;ved=2ahUKEwii1JOE3-mIAxWdhv0HHZ-DCjoQFnoECBkQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw34FMpF_sHCShVlyEoKrXNw)Mutual pleasure for both partners is shown but female pleasure and expectations are misrepresented, which challenges the question as to whom it is made for (male audience). If anything it is a representation of male fantasy  and it often does not focus on what is actually pleasurable for women irl, leading to orgasm gaps. Popular media and porn has it that PiV is the main event, aka sexual intercourse becoming the definition of sex itself, and has made it a notion to both genders that all women are always able to orgasm from PiV alone when it is very far from the truth. Leading to frustrating outcomes where men feel insecure about their performance and women think that something is wrong with them for not being able to orgasm as easily.[misrepresentation of female pleasure](https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/millennial-love-olivia-petter-extract)Sexual violence-wise, Japan is safer than many countries for outsiders, but to say that is among the safest for non-foreign women living there is not true at all. Their culture downplays sexual assault and rape, often going underreported and even goes as far as to take no action after reporting. Japanese women are expected to be subservient and 'take' sex as it happens to them, and their pornography very clearly reflects it. They had to create women only compartments in trains because of how common groping was, there is also a whole porn category for this in Japan which is distrubing.[Sexual violence in Japan](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/commentary/2024/04/10/japan/sexual-violence-japan-nhk-survey/)\\nApart from all that, the exploitation of vulnerable women and children in this industry affects them in such a way that is quite different to getting exploited in other industries. You're often dehumanized after being involved in porn, whereas the general public has a lot more empathy towards child labor in a coal mine in the Africas or a sweatshop worker in Bangladesh. Ask any guy if they'd like to be with a woman who has a history of being in the porn industry, most of them will say no. Same goes for when asked to women about men who has previously worked in the industry.Porn is not a monolith. You keep talking about how you enjoy sensual and passionate porn in this thread, depending on your definition of it, those are the only ones where mutual pleasure and consent may be depicted. Yet you cherry pick and choose to ignore the other side of the coin which depicts very inhumane acts as something totally normal when it's not.","title":"CMV: Porn is not a bad thing.

The combat is so intense and slick. Bullet Time is a massive game-changer to Hotline Miamis formula, and having doors always be breakable changes the combat flow immensely. Weapon variety is good, and I particularly like the mechanic of being able to control which weapons you can get by having them spawn in on enemies. Of course, the better weapons you give yourself the more dangerous your enemies are. And you need the more powerful weapons to get past the boss fights. The game is, even with bullet time and being able to survive numerous bullets, still very difficult. Enemies can swarm you very easily, especially if you arent careful about shooting open doors. Enemies with explosive vests are particularly dangerous because of this, as well as the mounted MG enemies that can hose you down from beyond the edge of the screen. Even with a health bar, you need some form of healing and defense through the games upgrades if you want a chance to beat the final stages. Upgrades take the form of drinks purchased at a recurring bar. Currency to get upgrades is dropped by enemies, and the more you kill in a short period the higher your combo meter builds up as in Hotline Miami. Youre heavily incentivized to play aggressively and raise the combo meter as getting your combo higher means you can afford more and better upgrades if you survive long enough to reach the bar. In addition, if you cant afford to buy upgrades, you can invest your currency toward unlocking new upgrades that become available at the bar.

You've basically said that the _woman_ must marry the _man_, you're already interpreting it through a modern lens. But how does the text actually put it? \\"_He_ must marry the _woman_.\\" This whole idea offends our modern sensibilities. But if you consider it from their perspective, it's basically saying you can't decide to just have sex with any woman and leave her used and abandoned. In that cultural context, a non-virgin woman is less likely to get married. And to be an unmarried woman in that society is risky. But also in that society there are expectations for how a husband treats their wife/wives. If he doesn't follow through then he will experience social shame, which in that society is everything. The reality is he is now _forced_ to provide security to the woman he used, with security being the main reason women would get married then in the first place. This idea could be applied to many of your examples.\\nAlso, this isn't hypocrisy at all, since we are not living by these laws now. It would be hypocrisy if we said, for instance, sex should be reserved for those that are married, but then everyone just freely has sex before marriage anyway.","title":"CMV: Porn is not a bad thing.

I appreciate a data-based debate.Before getting too deep into it\\nYour debate focuses only on the perspective of us being here firstagain, what about those here before us? I know its comparing apples to tennis ballsbut merely pointing out you might be cherry picking.In general youre oversimplifying and stereotyping a model minority.Maybe dig deeper??For example, Asian-Americans is a wide generalization. Indian- and Filipino-Americans have higher median incomes ($119K and $90K respectively) but other sub-groups are not even close.And when you consider that median simply means 1/2 the numbers above the middle and 1/2 the numbers belowa better approach would be NORMALIZED MODE income, i.e., better reflects reality as youd see it in the schools, stores, and on the street. But such reports simply do not delve into this type of analysis because it doesnt help policy makersits too accurate.~31% of Black immigrants have at least a 4yr degree, compared to American-born Blacks at about 25%. The rate for American-born Blacks is better than it used to be, but the deeper dive points again to the model minority bias.And, if you drill down even further you see that African-born Blacks with 4yr degrees rises to about 41%. I have yet to research this next point, but Id bet African immigrants without 4yr degrees upon arrival probably have similar degree achievement rates to American-born Blacksin other words NOT anywhere from 6-16% higher than American-born. Im suggesting here that if you dont come through the borders with some sort of edgesimply being from away doesnt guarantee better results. So at the risk of starting a different disagreement, Black immigrants have been less subjected to potential systemic limiters which would likely increase their earning potential.Look, I sincerely appreciate engaging in a positive fashion.

Yes some addicts are in denial but we dont know OP and as such we have no idea about his circumstances. Something isnt an addiction just because you take it every day, an example of this is ADHD Medication.  Someone is prescribed ADHD meds and take them every day, their brain has become dependent on them but they dont cause problems, in fact the doctor prescribed them because they help more with other problems then they cause problems for this specific individual.We wouldnt call that an amphetamine addiction, thats just called a prescription of medicine.\\nIts the same with drinking coffee, coffee is objectively a drug and the majority of people drink coffee, a lot of them every day. Yet we dont really hear people talking about coffee addiction seriously, because usually it is not causing enough problems and as such is not problematic. A dependence is not the same as an addiction is my point, and we cant know for sure about OPs circumstances. Theres way more people that watch porn regularly then that actually have an addiction and OP might be someone that regularly uses it but doesnt run into problems or lets it consume his life.And if it doesnt cause problems for OP then it is unlikely he would stop just for a random Reddit comment, just how I drink coffee everyday and wouldnt stop for an extended period because of a Reddit comment, even though Im not necessarily addicted to coffee.To add to my points Im pretty sure porn addiction is not classified as a real addiction yet in the medical field as theres lots of contradicting research and views on the matter.Although I personally believe you can get addicted to anything if you have an unhealthy relationship with it and are prone to addiction because of pre-existing issues.

You went from \\"F the DNC, we need better Democrats whose policies will save the country from the coming ravages of fascism and corporate greed\\" to \\"the DNC is actually correct, let's listen to them and happily elect the greedy fascist.\\"  Regardless of what you think of Democrats or Kamala Harris, this is one of the most pitiful things I have seen.I'll give a reason to be afraid of him.  It has been basically proven that a sitting president is above the law.  Even if there is massive evidence of criminality, by gentleman's agreement in Washington they cannot be indicted.  Since it is clear that no crime will be big enough ever again to make 10+ Senators cross the aisle to convict a president from their own party, there will never be a successful conviction for impeachment in our lifetimes.  If neither Trump nor Biden (an unhinged lunatic and a man who could barely talk anymore) were ousted via the 25th Amendment, that's never going to happen either, short of a president falling into a coma.  (It actually has a higher burden to oust than impeachment does, if the president fights against being removed.)So right now the ONLY way to hold a president accountable is to defeat him/her at the ballot box and then indict him/her afterward on crimes committing during the presidency--something that with the help of Trump's SCOTUS appointees is rapidly dwindling also.  The most remarkable thing happened over the last couple of years--Trump was indicted on four sets of crimes, and convicted on one set.  The odds of someone rich being actually convicted in this justice system?  The odds of someone White?  Rightwing?  An ex-president?  A celebrity?  They're all small or tiny, and the odds of this happening to someone who is all of these things is minuscule.  Add to that that he has literally appointed judges that are overseeing his cases, and ALSO that the jury was not intimidated by the certain mob of lunatics out there who scream from the rooftops that they'll do violence to anyone that thwarts their demigod Trump.  Somehow despite every single probability, Trump was handed SOME amount of accountability, and if the trials are allowed to continue next year, likely some more accountability for his (alleged) crimes.  It's a very small victory for justice, but it's the only one we have.However, if Trump wins, he will pardon himself and all of his co-conspirators, and so that incredibly difficult effort to indict and convict him will also become meaningless.  We cannot have a president that pardons himself for his own crimes.  Plain and simple.  It's simply a literal dictatorship if we do.  Forget about Trump--any future president can commit the worst crimes you can even imagine, knowing \\"it doesn't matter, I won't even face accountability for this even if I lose, I'll just keep running for president again and then I'm permanently immune.\\"  Worst thing you can possibly do to a system you're trying to fix.But it's actually much worse than that in Trump's case, because some of the crimes he is charged with involve attempting to steal the election itself.  January 6th was a coup attempt--not because of the rioters at the Capitol, but because he was trying to get fake electors to forge that they were the real electors in the swing states, so that Pence \\"wouldn't know which slate was real,\\" would send the slates back to the states, the clock would run out and the House would elect Trump.  The rioters were there to try to intimidate Pence and others into not counting the certifications.  That's an actual theft of the election, much worse than what the SCOTUS did in 2000.If someone can just STEAL the election, and then become president and know that they are now immune for all crimes in perpetuity, every single person from now on is going to commit any crime he/she can in order to steal the election.  The shenanigans by the DNC in 2016?  It will just be EVERYONE doing that now.  A candidate has to kill poll workers so that he/she can get favorable poll workers that will rig the vote?  They're immune from that crime if they win.  They have to kill enough members of Congress so that the remaining ones refuse to certify?  There are no laws anymore, just win.  Poison their opponent--who cares, nothing is a crime anymore as long as they win.So even if you prefer Trump to Harris, or your understanding of politics is nothing but \\"F the DNC and nothing else matters,\\" if you have any interest at all in a system of government that does function or will ever function again, the moment you re-elect a criminal who pardons himself for crimes related to stealing an election, there's nothing more after that.

While it may have sounded like that was the intent, the intent was always a rules-based society where the biggest dog (America) could push the boundaries as needed, but the rest needed to stick to the line.-and I don't think that's bad. There is a seemingly \\"fair\\" aspect where any government willing to reliquish power and join the world trade order would generally be accepted. The problem is that societies where power is highly centralized, those in power rarely wish to ive it up.At the same time, American Internationalism was made to block bad actors from enjoying the benefits from internationalism. While this may push others to form pacts of their own, that's kind of build in by design. American internationalism cannot work without a potential boogyman. Russia provided the stimulus NATO needed to bring in more members. China created the stimulus to drag traditionally unfriendly nations back into America's good graces (Phillippines and Vietnam). North Korea creates the conditions for a permanent American presence in South Korea.Similarly, while we might not agree with Israel, we agree less with Iran- so we make bedfellows with unsavory people in the Middle East, not because we champion an ideal, but because we have a unified enemy.TL;DR. It was always American-led Internationalism. Some countries that may not always agree will ultimately work together (Israel/Egypt/Saudi Arabia), bring neutral nations to the fold (Norway/Sweden), drag up African nations via $$$, bring unfriendly nations to America (Phillippines/Vietnam), and militarize others (NATO/Japan/Korea) all for the benefit of what America sees as a world order.

Society is made better because of porn."},{"text":"OK...You're kind of approaching this in a way that looks for a very strict \\"good\\" vs \\"bad\\" in these two nebulous terms. That's probably not going to be possible.Nationalism, when it's a foundation to protect domestic labor through strong unions and politicians who defend the domestic consumer and producer is a positive, but populists tend to take this idea too far (sometimes way too far). Nationalism can become populism (and even authoritarianism) if democratically elected people vest too much power in a centralized figure or unelected body to roll that out.Globalism has been used as a reason to steam-roll labor and consumer rights in favor of higher profits. In countries like the USA where bribes to policymakers are essentially legal through a number of channels, you get cronyism that is very adversarial towards domestic consumer and laborer. In general, international trade and cooperation through treaties and contracts can be healthy, but only when the incentives that drive cronyism and corruption are absent.What you need is intelligent and dynamic leaders to balance interests and stand shoulder to shoulder with the working and middle class in a country to find the right balance in all these fairly nebulous ideas.

The right likes to paint the left as elitist but I think thats because we prefer data over emotion. That preference for data often requires study, and looking at history as something to learn from.not perpetuate. It doesnt mean we dont have emotion, it doesnt mean we dont value family, it doesnt mean we dont value lifeat the end of the day a basic statement of each sides values would look remarkably similar. The left just happens to want to include more people. Whereas our brethren on the other side of the aisle appear to act from emotioneven provoking emotion. A dislike of change. What I think is a fervent belief that if someone gets something its a cost to them, personally. A zero sum kind of mindset. Back to the middle ground thoughWhat I mean is that a down and out person is likely to NOT be conservative because they need help (even though their self respect may bristle). I get that conservatives like the bootstrap, self-reliant, self determination story line. Who wouldntif the odds are 50:50. Problem is, theyre notfrequently. I think sometimes it comes down to who was here first? And newcomers are vehemently disliked and distrusted and as a result suffer disproportionately.When I ask what about the millions of native Americans that were here first? Why doesnt your argument apply to them? And thats often when they get angry, and then the vitriol and name calling starts. As for illegalsthe things that are appropriate to care about are: are they violent or felons; do they register for and get green cards and move toward citizenship; and do they pay taxes?End of the day thats what I want. I wouldnt be here if my ancestors hadnt landed on Ellis Island from Ireland and Germany. So who is anyone to say no, youre brown and not from a country I likeso go away?

Does that address your question?[Edit] its barely been a few minutes and the votes have already gone negative. Which I expected. But why? Is it because my facts are wrong? I claimed no factsits all my opinion. So its my opinion being downvoted. Okay, you have different opinions and thats what America is supposed or be about. Heres something to think aboutor just disagree more withor rage against and call me names.Which parts of my opinion do you disagree with.?If its the parts that suggest conservatives and the right are disproportionately concerned about selfthen give me objective data that suggests yall have interest in or care for those that do not look like you, and other points along that line. Id welcome something verifiable by a 3rd party source that hates both sidesBecause something that is VERY different about being a liberal mind is that I can dislike what the data says, the facts, the proofand not feel the other side should be hated for it. Moreover, I might even change my mind about some of these fundamental differences in the human condition and how they ought to be addressedwhich I have never experienced a conservative/right-aligned mind do.

People talk about how Australia used to have more economic diversity, but that came apart when tariffs were lowered. I mean, everyone keeps braying for a lower cost of living and now this is the result.To convince that R&amp;D spending is not a waste of time or disdainful, it would be incredible to see some results; and I think a little arts and culture would be the magic it needs to happen. Why not divert some of that attention on exports? Or do some proper marketing for what we currently have? I don't mean just maintaining pure stats on exporting and shipping off goods according to an agreement. But it also does not need to be entirely new, just packaged nicely with a satin ribbon and shipped off.!deltaArts and culture are not useful in their own right. But they are useful to sway people, and they can be used to sway people for a good cause. Such as making them value STEM - right now a lot of people are using arts to spread disinformation and distrust of STEM (this is a global problem BTW).If you ask most, little is known about Australia's wine except Penfold's. Why not figure some interesting method for others? Things with labels attached work better. Have you ever heard of Hanwoo? It's Korean beef which is on par with some wagyu, but wagyu is simply more famous, and more well documented on than Hanwoo is. Agriculture R&amp;D with nice packaging for Australia would work nicely; the next level for export is usually culture as an added bonus via premium pricing. I think pure STEM is more like the internal workings, and a mix of both generally work better. It doesn't translate well purely STEM focused to public.Funny that you mention that. Australia is a major producer of both Hanwoo and Wagyu beef. They're produced here using the same methods used in Korea and Japan, respectively.","title":"CMV: A nation's lack of innovation is actually a very stubborn problem."},{"text":"Yeah, it's very puzzling because it is poor politics.

This is patently false. Pornography addiction is a well-documented phenomenon, with research showing that it rewires the brain in similar ways to drug addiction. Excessive porn consumption leads to changes in the brain's reward system, making users crave more extreme material over time to achieve the same level of arousal. This escalation mirrors the same cycle seen in other addictions, such as gambling, drugs, and alcohol.The changes in brain chemistry caused by porn addiction are real and harmful, leading to compulsive use, social isolation, anxiety, depression, and sexual dysfunction. So don't tell me that because you personally havent experienced addiction, it doesn't exist. Thats like a smoker who hasnt developed lung cancer claiming cigarettes arent harmful.**Religion and Morality**You take cheap shots at religion and misinterpret sacred texts in a way that suits your argument. But let's get real moral objections to pornography aren't limited to religious people. Many secular individuals and institutions oppose porn on ethical grounds because of the harm it does to relationships, the way it exploits vulnerable people (especially women), and its impact on shaping unhealthy societal attitudes toward sex.Your attempt to deflect by cherry-picking Bible verses as more obscene is a hollow distraction from the real issue: pornography harms people, and that harm is felt across all aspects of society, irrespective of religious beliefs.**Conclusion**In short, every single point you've made is either blatantly false, dangerously misleading, or a naive oversimplification of reality. Pornography is not some enlightened, liberating force for good in society. It contributes to the objectification of women, damages relationships, rewires the brain like a drug, and fosters dangerous attitudes toward sex and consent. The research is clear, overwhelming, and irrefutable: pornography is a societal poison. The sooner we as a society acknowledge this, the better we can begin to mitigate its harmful effects.","title":"CMV: Porn is not a bad thing.

The claim that porn prevents sexual violence because it acts as a vent for mens sexual desires is grotesque. Pornography doesnt diffuse sexual violence it feeds it. Research shows that pornography consumption correlates with increased sexual aggression and leads to desensitization to sexual violence. When people consume violent porn regularly, their thresholds for what they consider \\"normal\\" sexual behavior shift, and this has been linked to real-world sexual violence.Child molestation, rape, and other forms of sexual misconduct are not mitigated by pornography they are exacerbated by it. The normalization of exploitative and aggressive sexual acts in porn conditions viewers to accept and even seek out increasingly extreme behaviors, creating a feedback loop of sexual violence.**Porn Doesn't Cause Harm to Relationships?**One of the most absurd points you make is that pornography doesnt harm relationships. Wrong again. Research overwhelmingly shows that pornography consumption harms romantic relationships. Studies reveal that even moderate pornography use leads to lower relationship satisfaction, decreased emotional intimacy, and a significant drop in sexual satisfaction between partners.Pornography skews expectations for sex and intimacy, leading people to view their partners as mere objects of sexual pleasure rather than equals in a loving relationship. In fact, a study from Brigham Young University shows that pornography use, even at low levels, is harmful to romantic relationships, increasing the risk of infidelity, dissatisfaction, and emotional detachment. So your claim that porn is beneficial for lovers? Dead wrong.","title":"CMV: Porn is not a bad thing.

Pornography is directly linked to the degradation and objectification of women. Numerous studies show that consistent consumption of pornography correlates with increased sexist attitudes and a higher likelihood of endorsing violence against women. You cherry-pick maps and countries to support your narrative, but correlation doesn't imply causation. The countries that have higher rates of violence toward women might restrict porn, but thats because they are deeply patriarchal, not because theyre devoid of pornography.In fact, studies from respected academic journals show that pornography cultivates a culture of sexual entitlement, particularly among men, and normalizes the mistreatment of women. Researchers have found that the more men consume pornography, the more likely they are to view women as objects and engage in sexually coercive behavior. How can you possibly argue that this is \\"civilized\\"?You parade Japan and Israel as shining examples, but pornography has left its scars there too. In Japan, the rampant production and consumption of violent pornography have been linked to broader societal issues like sexual violence, the proliferation of child pornography, and harmful sexual practices. The safety you claim is more illusion than reality, as many women live in the shadow of deep societal misogyny, normalized through the consumption of hyper-violent, dehumanizing porn.","title":"CMV: Porn is not a bad thing.

When the details of the bill leaked, Speaker Johnson immediately said it was dead in the House - because it would not have increased border security, but would instead have normalized Biden's current open border polices, legalized millions of illegal aliens, and made it impossible for *future* Presidents to secure the border.  That's why Biden was in favor of it.4. The following day, Trump made a statement against the bill, when he found out the details.5. Senator Lankford was censured by the Republican Party in his home state for having been a part of it.6. If Democrats wanted the border secured, the Senate could have passed the border bill the House passed in May 2023, and Biden could have signed it into law.7. Biden didn't need new legislation to secure the border.  Trump had the lowest crossings in decades.  All he had to do in order to maintain that was... nothing.

We all saw what they did to Bernie when it looked like he was about to seriously challenge the machine, the Islamic Fundamentalist wing of the party will most likely endure the same treatment at the end of this because they didn't kiss the ring.  If Trump wins there is good odds that these people not only become hated by the Democrats because of the perception that they lost them the election, but they will most likely be in jail on federal charges too. I expect Trump will most likely be going gloves off on the various neo-confederate dipshits on the left and that will mean the moment they start ripping down American flags and looting/rioting they catch federal charges that take them off the streets.Looking forward to either outcome at this point because of how much contempt I have for these people.","title":"Democrat Rep.

Google Search Harris 9 month abortion Harris is on record as voting for no restrictions after 5 months. It is legal to get an abortion at 9 months. And often right at nine months, it is easier to give birth and kill the infant at that moment. It is happening, common logic tells you if it is legal to do so that people will do it. It may not be happening a ton but some desperate women may come to this. Of course, it isnt publicized. I have seen reports of abortionists explaining 9 month abortions, and I cannot find them now, in election season, on YouTube, or in a Google Search (both favoring Democrats narratives).  It is a bit easier on X where they do not censor facts to support a specific narrative.  Although, the mass media that is in the medias pocket, has told us not to trust any source that does not deliver their narrative and says they spew misinformation.  Misinformation is code for facts they dont want you to hear.  So if you are properly brainwashed you will not trust anything I get from X.  Unfortunately, there is not an agreed-upon source of information because there is the uncensored truth, and the Left is calling it misinformation.  Some abortionists talk about abortions at 9 months... it may take a little more digging but it happens. However, it is the same as any abortion: terminating a human life.BTW: most of the mass media and our sources for facts are in the Biden Administration and the Harris Administrations pockets.

First off japan just has less crime in general, and is a far safer country than most others but you have showed a clear lack of the understanding of the life their.First japan isn't a free-thinking country or progressive. They are blantly homophoibc and do not recognize same-sex marriages, they are blantly racist in their policies as police are allowed to stop foreginers at any point and look at their passports.They are an incredibly conservative culture, which forces schoolgirls to wear skirts even in the winter, and showing your neck and armpits are considered promiscuous. They have a rampart problem with upskirt photos to the point that all phones have must make a shutter sound by law, they also have a giant problem with the stealing of underwear and voyeurism by young menTheir are countless women-only zones, in public places as an effort to curb the sexual harassment they face such as being molested on trains. And famously at least nine of japans medical schools rigged their results to make sure woman wouldn't pass, because they didn't want them to get pregnant and miss work.Japan also censors all it's porn as it sees it as dirty, they like to profit off the sex industry but still look down on it far more than other countries. I would also like to add only about 5 to 10 percent of people report sexual assault, because in a collective society like japan talking about such things is frowned upon.Japanese people are also facing one of the biggest loneliness epidemics which also speaks to the impacts of porn on their society. Though I do grant their there work life balance is also a problem.Their is no study that says men who watch porn are more inclined to rape or not that haven't had holes shot through them due to basises. So any opinion on whether it allows men to vent or not is pointless, because we don't know that at all, especially when you consider rape is the most extreme form of sexual violence, it is like saying that doing meth makes someone commit war crimes, it won't but it might make them do a far lesser from of crime like stealing.Though is has been shown that it changes the way men view sex making them more unappealing partners, which causes them to not have sex.So I just feel like you haven't given this argument a fair look.

Wtf is he even talking about?!","title":"Republicans condemn Trumps insulting and false claims on Harriss mental fitness"},{"text":"There are a series of issues i have with your post, and with your commentsFirst porn does cause great amounts of addictions in people, simple saying that you haven't experienced it is irrelevant when it is heavily reported that it does exist. Also trying to deny it's effects by saying that these people might just become addicts to something else is also baseless because you can deny the fact that anything is addictive through that form of thinking. People at the end of the day can get addicted to anything but some things are more addictive and should discussed on the cost/benefit.The fact remains is that it is a quick activity that gives incredible amounts of dopamine to the brain, which causes many to become addictedAs other have said porn addiction makes people more dependent on it, and it has been shown that these people withdraw from finding sexual partners (An example would be japan) which would quite literally be the opposite of natural. Death grip is also a thing. No vagina can truly match one's hand (On average) and this causes many people to essentially train their bodies to only enjoy their hand, leading to erectile dysfunction.Saying porn also emulates consensual sex is a very misleading thing to say. Yes these people agree to have sex, but it exists to emulate a fantasy not what sex is actually like, people who watch it will have bad standards set for how sex is actually like, and cause self-esteem issues. One of the main issues with this fantasy is that the vast majority of porn shows women like dick under all circumstances which often leads to men ignoring woman's pleasure in sex. Or it shows how woman just automatically love things like choking and being abused.A perfect example of this is the uptake in young men just straight up trying to choke woman or do anal in their first few sexual experiences without actually asking the girl if she wanted. Yes woman do like these things, but actually taking about it before you do it is import.When people talk about consensual sex, they also talk about healthy sex. Setting boundaries, talking about what brings both parties pleasure, and not basing your experience off of fiction. Non of these things are discussed or seen in porn so pretending they are is dishonest.Next you have made points about how porn industry is no worst than the modeling, acting, politics, police, or even the catholic church, and I don't know why you would use any of these examples, as they are some of the most heavily criticised things on the planet.Modeling and acting have almost if not all the same self esteem issues, and warping relative issues as porn. These are already horrible industries that abuse people, and the porn industry is worst in every regard with far less regulation, and after they leave the industry they are left with next to nothing, so it is an industry that incourages you to give it as much as possible, while also telling people it is an easy way to earn money which insist true for the vast majority.Here are just a bunch of statistics to show you how much the industry effects both consumers and workers* Between 66% to 90% of women in the sex industry were sexually abused as children\\n* 89% of women in the sex industry said they wanted to escape, but had no other means for survival\\n* Women in the sex industry experience Post Traumatic Stress Disorder at rates equivalent to veterans of combat war (69%)\\n* Excessive interest in online porn contributed to more than 50% of all divorce cases in 2002\\n* 77% of online visitors to adult content sites are male.Their average age is 41 and they have an annual income of $60,000. 46% are married. - This is a 2001 Stat.

Here are verifiable facts for you, that you can logically deduce the truth from or, more likely be in denial about due to your scientific facts - which, your wording doesnt quite make sense: someone can be killed at any stage of life, it is scientifically possible to have 9 month and partial-birth abortions and infanticide is scientifically plausible so how is it disagreeing with scientific facts? We are in disagreement about current events happening, not on the science of late term, 3rd trimester abortions. So right off the bat, you lose credibility with me when you compare apples to oranges by confusing whether or not something is happening with what is scientifically possible. Here are the facts, and the source is a quick Google search you can do for yourself.Google Search: Walz 9 month abortion: the very first article that popped up for me, a few paragraphs down, says Opponents decried the bill as\\nextreme, saying that it and other fast-tracked legislation will leave Minnesota with essentially no restrictions on abortion at any stage of pregnancy. - but I am sure if our algorithms are different on our computer even if the same, exact article doesnt pop up for you, that you will come across it quickly.  Google Search Harris 9 month abortion Harris is on record as voting for no restrictions after 5 months. It is legal to get an abortion at 9 months. And often right at nine months, it is easier to give birth and kill the infant at that moment. It is happening, common logic tells you if it is legal to do so that people will do it. It may not be happening a ton, because I agree that most women pregnant after 5 months want their babies.  But some desperate women may come to this. Of course, it isnt publicized. I have seen reports of abortionists explaining 9 month abortions, and I cannot find them now, in election season, on YouTube, or in a Google Search (both favoring Democrats narratives).  It is a bit easier on X where they do not censor facts to support a specific narrative.  Although, the mass media that is in the medias pocket, has told us not to trust any source that does not deliver their narrative and says they spew misinformation.  Misinformation is code for facts they dont want you to hear.  So if you are properly brainwashed you will not trust anything I get from X.  Unfortunately there is not an agreed upon source of information because there is the uncensored truth, and the Left is calling it misinformation.  Some abortionists talk about abortions at 9 months... it may take a little more digging but it happens. However, it is the same as any abortion: terminating a human life.BTW: most of the mass media and our sources for facts are in the Biden Administration and the Harris Administrations pockets.

Same goes for things like equal rights for racial/sexual/religious minorities. I would venture that most of us are good with equality under the law, equal rights, and equal *opportunity* (not outcome). We just hate the State, media, and corporations fishing for higher ESG scores, shoving this constant equity nonsense down our throats. With all that said, libertarianism attracts a lot of allegedly small government people who believe in scaling back social programs, and having low or no taxes, but also think their conservative values are the only way to live life and dont want others poisoning that. Theyre more like Tea Party Republicans than actual libertarians. I can say that, for many things, Im very live and let live. I have my own personal morals and beliefs and a lot of things in society clash with that, but as long as youre a consenting adult, you should be free to do whatever you want with your own time and resources, as long as you refrain from infringing on my rights. I see no place for the State to legislate morality, just secure the rights of the person and property so as to ensure they are not infringed upon, and let the courts settle it.

He demanded that congressional Republicans whom he largely controls reject a border enforcement bill negotiated by senators on both sides of the aisle. Trump has long viewed bipartisan governance as weak, and a political win for vulnerable Democratic congressional candidates in this high-stakes election cycle could have stung the GOP.Harris vowed that if elected she will reintroduce the immigration bill, which would multiply border agents and strengthen asylum laws. She also proposed adding new fentanyl detection machines at U.S. entry points. An ad touting her proposals is running in Arizona and other border states.The Democratic candidates trip to the border was designed to counter claims by Trump and his MAGA allies that Harris and the Biden administration opened the floodgates to illegal aliens. Both Trump and Vance have spread outlandish claims that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, have been stealing and eating residents pet dogs and cats, leading a group to seek criminal charges against them.Harris trip, however, came at an awkward time, as new government data revealed that more than 13,000 immigrants convicted of homicide, whether in the United States or abroad, are living freely in the U.S. The data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement was provided to Congress.The Trump campaign on Friday ridiculed Harris, who Trump routinely calls the Biden administration's border czar, for taking a trip to the border to rewrite the past 44 months of chaos, crime, and bloodshed caused by her open border policy. Campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said voters are smart enough to realize Kamala Harris has been in charge of the border for four years and she has failed.\\"As anti-immigration sentiment among voters has soared, according to Gallup polling, Trump and Vance have hammered the issue constantly on the campaign trail. At a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, last weekend, Trump declared, I am your border president, your border president. Kamala would be your invasion president.Recent polls show that even as Harris matches or surpasses Trump in national head-to-head polls, the GOP candidate still owns the immigration narrative. A recent New York Times/Siena College poll finds a significant number of voters trust Trump over Harris to handle the issue of the border.But Harris campaign advisers think the Democrats visit to the border will help narrow the gap on her longstanding political vulnerability.","title":"Kamala Harris Shoves the Migrant Border Crisis in Trumps Face - Giddy Up, Cowboy"},{"text":"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-very-fine-people/people who dont watch debates but see clips on social media is a majority of Americans.

This whole notion that trump sank the GOP bill isn't the win dems seem to think it is. That border bill would have literally been the worst border policy and administrative power grab in american history had it passed. Soooo yeah, not exactly thrilled that biden decided he wanted to play chicken with people who regularly lie and make shit up and don't give a fuck about hypocrisy just to show people that republicans are... hypocrites. Imagine where we'd be right now if they actually voted that bill in. Actually most people don't actually know what was in it that was so bad in the first place. Fun things like more executive powers to the president, cause you know... thats never come back and bitten the country in the ass. Or giving republicans even more control over federal agencies. But more over, the ENTIRE notion of this argument is lost in the first sentence. Why is the harris admin blaming trump for a failed border. It suggests to the people that they have no plans, no ideas or even concepts and ceded the ENTIRE problem to republicans. Great!... excpet not really. Like it or not any border problems right now are owned by the current admin. And the biden admin has not been great on the border. Mostly because of inaction. But in some spots they've made trump created problems even worse than they already were. But again, this cedes the entire debate to republicans. That biden or harris has no solution and the only people with answers are racist republicans. When you could also -literally- talk to a hundred immigration lawyers and they will all tell you the exact same thing. The problem is not the border, its the courts and system not being able to process cases and get people sorted.

About 93.5%. A smaller percentage of abortions were performed from the 14-20 week mark. Around 5.7%. And even fewer percentage of abortions were performed at or after 21 weeks. Around 0.09%. These are the abortions that are necessary to save the life of the mother. No professional doctor is preforming an abortion on a woman who is 7-9 months pregnant, and if its happening: it is the worst case scenario for those families. And if its happening in back alleys that late stage: that is what the fuck sexual education is for.

He always chose porn instead. That is absolutely not normal behavior. It can also cause Erectile Dysfunction in men even in their 20s or in some cases men can only get up for porn. I have some issues with this argument.  There is the possibility that porn is not actually the cause of an unhealthy obsession, but is a kind of receptacle for such an obsession.  Such people who have this fixation with porn would doubtful be better off if porn was banned.  They may just instead turn to physical groping of women or voyeurism or hidden cameras in women's locker rooms and such.  This fixation on sex which you mentioned says more about the person doing the fixating than about the thing being fixated upon.  However, you have made some good points.  Personally, I can't imagine turning down sex for porn; it's like turning down eating a Big Mac in order to drool over a McDonald's commercial for Big Macs.  But if there is any truth in what you're saying, then that would seem to indicate a possible problem with porn, so for this I grant a !delta.  Because of this Ive noticed a trend of the way men treat women in bed. Often times theyll be very rough without consent and even slap, spit on or choke women like they see in porn. This is confirmation bias.  There are many women who actually do enjoy rough sex involving slapping and choking.Another reason people dont agree with supporting this god awful industry is the treatment of the women, rampant sex trafficking/actual rape and CP. Ive also seen plenty of testimonies of pornstars who talk about being drugged, raped and often so much damage done to their body like prolapses. More confirmation bias.  There are plenty of industries and institutions that have problems with internal corruption, such as the music and movie industry, politicians, and police departments.  Not to mention the Catholic church, which is supposed to be a paragon of virtue.  But people only look at the corruption in the porn industry because of their preconceived hatred of porn.","title":"CMV: Porn is not a bad thing.

Ted Cruz may lose, Kari Lake will lose, Mark Robinson will lose. Who is out stumping for Trump? MAGA weirdo's like RFK Jr, and a freakshow of losers. Harris has Obama hosting dinners and raising $40 million bucks. The polls are the ONLY good news for MAGA, and they have been shifting rapidly and are also polls. I have confidence Walz will be able to communicate the obvious differences with Vance in the debate Tuesday. He very well could be driving a massive stake into the MAGA movement- that is in many ways on the rocks.","title":"Jeff Flake endorses Kamala Harris for president: 'I know of her character'"},{"text":"More like when they beat you and you tell them they suck","title":"Kamala Harris Campaign Confronts Trump With New Ad on Truth Social"},{"text":"Im going to preface this by saying that Im a veteran, a high percentage of the men in my family are veterans, and most of my friends are veterans as well.

A mental health professional with a full caseload of self-pay clients can pull in close to six figures after expenses, or possibly in the six figures depending on how much they work/bill. The problem is insurance payouts are uniformly below market rate and some reimburse less than half of what we'd charge out of pocket. My out of pocket rate is $120 per session, but no insurance pays that high and some companies will go as low as $45 per session. That's too low, and low reimbursement per session encourages the therapists who do accept insurance to take on too many clients, thus the burn out. After the cut from my practice and supervisor, I average between $35-40 per session, and at maximum, I see 25 clients per week. Any more than that is simply too much and I'll burn out. But it is hard to fill my schedule to that degree because people cancel and most people prefer after-work appointments, typically between 4pm and 6pm. Any time before 3 pm is difficult to fill. All this is also before taxes and I don't get benefits (thankfully my wife gets good benefits from her job). If insurance companies reimbursed my full rate, I'd make $60 per session ($72 once I don't have to pay my supervisor) at my current practice. That's much more doable to live on in my area. It would also solve the problem that many therapists choose not to accept insurances that reimburse at low rates, making it difficult for those people to access care.","title":"CMV: The way out of the drastic shortage of mental health service professionals in the U.S. is to drastically lower barriers to entry."},{"text":"Moron!

Oil is averaging around 42-45% of GDP, not anywhere near 87%. Where on earth did you get that claim? [Economy of Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Saudi_Arabia)0% tax is sign that people arent generating the wealth of Its country, but the oil fields are.That is honestly a very creative cope for having to pay 30% direct taxes. What is the problem with that? If they have enough oil money to relieve their citizens and allow them to live comfortably, that is very good. It is not something to shame them for.It also reeks of desperately trying to drum up artifical tourism by trying to appeal to the worlds tax cheats.Whoa calm down. That is literally every country in the world. Saudi Arabia realizes that it is heavily dependent on oil, and that if it keeps using the same amount of oil it does, it will be completely depleted in the next 60 years. So the kingdom is hoping to create many entertainment projects to increase revenue from other sectors and mainly the tourism sector. That is praiseworthy, and not blameworthy. That is what vision 2030 is all about. Why are you trying to find any little thing to criticize Saudi Arabia for?If it is a pioneer in genetic engineering, it would be because they would be okay with experimenting on humans for money.PFFT WHAT?! ?? The other biggest sky scrapper they built has no sewer system and the islands they spend a fortune building are reciding into the sea.Where did you get that from? They havent even built it yet. Its due 2030. Youre talking about Burj Khalifa in the UAE. Not Saudi. And not having a sewage system doesnt mean anything, the waste is still removed. Huge unneeded mega projects are almost starting to become the calling card for countries in decline.It is needed to both attract tourists and also to make the citizens happy. And Saudi Arabia is anything BUT in decline. Havent you seen the changes? Women no longer need male guardianship, women can drive, the religious police has been abolished, women dont need to wear the Hijab, and the country is just overall modernizing  and becoming better. Its not in decline, its the opposite. No other country has made such a significant change in such a short amount of time.The future is Saudi. If it wasnt for oil, saudia arabia would be another middle eastern non event of a country.OKAY? That is not an argument! They have oil and theyre using it well. How is that bad? They are smart and they know that they must lower their dependence on oil and they succeeded in that. [Saudi Arabia Hits Milestone In Shift Away From Oil Economy](https://gfmag.com/economics-policy-regulation/saudi-arabia-milestone-shift-oil-green-transition/)Im not even going to indulge the environmental friendly image, the only interest saudia arabia would have in green energy is buying it in order to shut it down.I dont understand where the hell youre getting these conspiracy theories from? You have no basis or proof. Saudi Arabia has a much greater literacy rate (at 99.36%) compared to USA (at 79%). And a higher percentage of people entering tertiary education. The country has also produced a significant number of the best physicians and has some of the lowest inflation rates in the world. It is a great country that is leading the Arab world, and soon will surpass even the UAE.

While there is much overlap, there is not to my knowledge scientific consensus that addiction is always driven by mental health conditions.  Alcoholism is effectively treated by whatever means achieves sobriety, and so there are a variety of tools available.  There is no problem substance for other mental health concerns and so treatment is not a matter of doing what it takes to help the person adapt to life without the substance.  Indeed, for those with dual-diagnosis, people with serious mental health conditions existing alongside substance use or addiction, more and not less specialization is required. I dont think a BA graduate will be able to effectively treat someone experiencing withdrawal while also having hallucinations that result from mood-dependent psychosis (e.g. bipolar).The guy in your neighborhood might work for sub clinical populations where the idea of therapy is probably overkill and a good self help book would do.

Young girls who watch porn might also get into unrealistic expectations about their prospective partners' physique and stamina, but also get self esteem issues watching female porn stars have constants orgasms when they might be unable to achieve that in real life and come to believe there is some problem with them.Literally all of this is fixed by simply telling young people, 'Porn is acting. The women you see enduring having their gag reflex aggressively attacked over and over again are being paid. The dicks are all way above average in size.' Straight up add that and whatever else ought to be said about it to a sex education curriculum the youth encounter in the school system and problem solved.

Im going to only address the addiction paragraph because it has the most research behind it. You start out stating a personal anecdote- youve never found porn to be addicting. I think its needless to say that your personal experience doesnt mean porn addiction doesnt exist. Then you go on to say that the desire for sex is natural, and therefore you cant be addicted to a natural desire. This is false. All addictions are motivated by a natural desire for dopamine. I think you may be confusing the ability to be addicted to something with the general notion that addiction is unhealthy. Not all addictions cause immediate bodily harm as do smoking, drinking, and drug addictions- I could be addicted to working out, addicted to self care, addicted to music, addicted to working my joball addictions have the ability to be destructive in a persons life when the activity is in excess, including a porn addiction. Additionally, yes we do have a desire to engage in sexual activity, but porn is the action of *watching* sexual activity, so when we refer to a *porn addiction (and not a sex addiction)*, were talking strictly about someone who engages in an overconsumption of sexual content in media. This can be compared to having a tv addiction- youre addicted to the *content*. This brings us back to the main point. Addiction is caused by the brains desire to replenish lost dopamine. A healthy amount of dopamine is necessary for most people, but when we either snort, drink, do, or watch something that brings in an *excess* of dopamine, the brain is flooded with happiness. Porn watching in itself is not bad but when there is a *dependence on the dopamine you are receiving from watching the content*, thats when it becomes an addiction. This is when we start seeing the negative side effects, which is your next point. When we start depending on a source for dopamine, its easy to drop other more important, less appealing things for the dopamine hit. A persons brain begins to seek out the dopamine hit once the last hit has subdued. If we are at the stage of addiction, depression and anxiety begin to seep in thanks to the lack of happy chemicals. Research shows a strong correlation between anxiety/ depression and porn- its a bit uncertain as to which one is the chicken and the egg. It certainly is known that its circular and as the addiction worsens, the anxiety and depression also worsen. Some people might never experience addiction per se because they have more chemically stable brains, but at that point we are talking more about a regular porn watcher than an addict. Research shows that the porn addict will even neglect sex with a partner over their porn addiction, which to your point should technically be unnatural if we as humans have a desire for sex. Partners have shown to withdraw emotionally and sexually as they seek to fulfill their need for porn. The fact that a lot of porn isnt representative of real sex also affects how the watcher is stimulated- it slowly becomes more and more unnatural. Theres also documented cases where porn addicts become derealized during in person, live sex, as they can lose touch with reality due to the media consumption. The negative effects of porn addiction are well documented- look through NIH brain studies and whatnot. I guess you could say its better to have a porn addiction than a crack addiction, but again the porn addict may neglect their personal responsibilities as well as become a shell of a human as they begin to live for the porn rather than have a life and identity outside of it. Personally, I def have met some porn addicts who even preferred to be late to work or refused to go on dates because they preferred to stay home and watch porn lol.","title":"CMV: Porn is not a bad thing.

It was maybe 20 years ago. Oh, and the fake news heard about it. They said, it never happened. It never happened. And I didnt know who it was. It was a group that honored me as man of the year. The fakers back there, see the fake news. But they said  They said, oh  And they looked and, you know, they said it never happened. But I said, I swear to you, it happened.It did happen. I was man of the year. And I came and I made a speech and I said, why do you allow them to take your car business away? Why do you allow it to happen? Theyre taking your business away. And I didnt know too much about it. All I know is they were taking your car industry away from you. They said it never happened.And lo and behold, somebody said, I remember the event. And then we found out and we had everything. We got the awards. We had everything. It did happen. But I gave a speech, which at the time was pretty controversial. We cant let them take your car business away. Its such an important business.And you know its an important business even in times of war where they switch over. And it was really something. And I looked at that speech from, I dont know, its like 19, 20 years ago. And I could repeat it now without changing a word.You cannot let foreign countries, and a lot of the times our worst foes are our so-called friends, okay? You know, our friends, the European Union takes tremendous advantage of us. As an example, they give us cars by the millions. We dont have too many Chevrolets in the middle of European cities, okay? European Union is brutal. They dont take our farm products for the most part. They dont take a lot. But unlike Kamala, who always complains and doesnt do anything, I keep saying, why dont you do?I saw Marsha the other day. Why doesnt she, why didnt she do it four years ago almost? And I say that, you know, shes on the border today trying just to, what a day for the border. She goes to the border today, and they just announced just before she got up to speak that more than 13,000 murderers from jail, solitary confinement people in many cases, were released.But I just say, lets go back. So we cant let them take our businesses. And were not gonna let them take our businesses. And you can control that so easily through good policy. Not her kind of policy, by the way. She changed her policy 15 times. No fracking. Oh, I like fracking. Defund the police. She wants to defund the police. Now, oh, I love the police all of a sudden. By the way, when anybody is into defunding the police even for a day during their career, they can no longer serve as President of the United States, I can tell you.So were not gonna let them take our businesses. And really, a lot of thats determined by our taxation policy. When China has to pay all that money, the people that liked me the best were the steel companies because I saved them. They were dumping China and others, but mostly China was dumping steel in here at levels that nobody had ever seen before.And it was putting the steel companies out of business. I put a 50% and 100% tax on the dumping of steel and the steel companies thrived. I saved them, and you have to have the steel companies. So well do the same thing.And you dont worry about it.

That's an easy message.What I don't really understand is the bill linked in the article, nor the mechanisms by which he proposes to spread out risk. I'm going to try to write a summary of ideas, and if something is very off, please correct me. I don't know much about property insurance for the record, so I've used a combination of Investopedia and a few other media articles to try and learn.  **Summary**: Given extreme weather, insurance companies (A) want to transfer that risk to someone else, given the relative risk of holding some policies. Reinsurance companies (B) assume some of the risk of these policies, because they want to collect some of the premiums. A -- B, so far. The phrase \\"reinsurance is insurance for insurance companies\\" seems to make some sense in theory. Property insurance companies are required to keep reserves to pay out claimants in the event of a disaster, adequate to the number of policies they issue. However, this can limit the amount of business they can do, given the reserves they must maintain. Reinsurance, therefore, is a way to increase business without needing to increase the reserve amounts. While small claims are usually handled within the capital requirements of the original insurance company, a huge claim (perhaps from historic flooding) may enlist the help of reinsurance companies to handle the increased risk while not losing the sale. (Sidenote: I would love to see how Matt Levine or someone like him would cover an insurance topic like this. He works mainly with finance, but I often find his writing crystal clear and it helps make some finance stories less nebulous).Rep. Moskowitz claims hurricanes and storms are driving up costs for people buying these insurance policies, based on increasing reinsurance rates offered by these reinsurers. Moreover, he believes there is a growing gap between the overall cost of damages and the reinsurance cap limits (not sure how these are determined, other than by reinsurance companies themselves in what they offer). To quote:  The bonds would fund the difference between the cap set on reinsurance requirements and the sum of homeowner damages caused by the event. In essence, the Federal government will help guarantee part of the insurance cost for homeowners when disaster strikes. Moskowitz claims this wouldnt drive up costs for the federal government beyond administrative ones and the main mechanism would be the government posting post-event bonds to aid insurance companies. I took a look at the bill text itself and while I didnt get too far, Im wary of the idea of favoring insurance companies to bypass reinsurers. **Conclusions**: I dont think this program would be effective. The mechanism here is to issue bonds to pay out directly to insurance companies, thus undercutting reinsurers, and essentially tying together insurance companies and the federal government to support homeowners in disaster-prone areas.","title":"Florida Rep.

Basically, for the first six months or so new counselors are surprisingly effective. It then drops off a bit and then starts to climb back up. The theory is that the authenticity that comes with the energy of someone just entering the field transfers to patients in a positive way. This effect compensates for the lack of experience plus a little more and then the value of experience eventually catches up.  The newness effect is interesting but no one is going to limit their career to only 6 months and I cant see any way to replicate novelty. As for comparing different education levels, Im not aware of any, the obvious would be comparing PHD counselors to masters level counselors.  If I did come across such a study, I would be highly skeptical.  Id want to know exactly what methods they used to control for differences in experience.  To my mind this is impossible because PhD candidates usually get a non terminal masters degree as part of the PHD process and then specialize with clinical experience as they approach graduation.  So is a PHD really that different than a masters degree plus experience?  In terms of clinical effectiveness I think they would be expected to be about the same (masters with 3-4 years experience vs new PHD), but the PHD has an easier time getting teaching gigs and writing articles.","title":"CMV: The way out of the drastic shortage of mental health service professionals in the U.S. is to drastically lower barriers to entry."},{"text":"Trump 2024!': Young supporter with rare brain disorder beams after surprise meeting with former presidenthttps://www.yahoo.com/news/see-trump-meets-young-supporter-004230485.html","title":"Just a reminder: Obama won his very first election by charging his opponents with election fraud.

There is no bottom when it comes to low standards for mental health. Who is paying them? I think it starts by raising the floor. The lowest pay is in community mental health settings.  Here, the funding is set by the state legislative process with tax dollars footing the bill.  So, fixing the floor requires political will.  If Im writing my representatives, Im going to tell them to pay the counselors more rather than say that poor mental health patients should get a lower standard of care. Raise the floor and this should help the general ecosystem. AI helpbots are interesting.  I think there should be more guardrails there and Im not sure where that will land. I think there are too many variables for bots to handle mental health without a human overseeing the process but it is theoretically possible that the advanced linguistic capabilities of a machine may help if sufficient guardrails are in place. This of course assumes that patients will be amenable to having a machine help them with problems, and I think people should always be given an option to talk with another human.  But this doesnt mean less standards, just rethinking the whole system. There are other things in the works like ketamine and psilocybin assisted therapy that I think have promise. But again I dont want staff below a certain skill level doing these things.  Patients deserve a higher level of care, not lower.","title":"CMV: The way out of the drastic shortage of mental health service professionals in the U.S. is to drastically lower barriers to entry."},{"text":"I'm not disagreeing with you, but the current form of the Republican party is pretty much all white supremacists or other bigots.?\\nThey brought us Trump, because that was inevitable, and I don't see old school Republicans getting away from the crazy to save the party.\\nThat's what they sowed.","title":"Jeff Flake endorses Kamala Harris for president: 'I know of her character'"},{"text":"I mean, yeah, it's not exactly a positive message, but it IS true.

The ability to shape U.S. policies and wield executive power is a form of influence that cannot be equated with financial wealth alone.No one on our end (America) is starting a war. Trump has had the convenience of no war starting while hes been in office. Dumb luck. Whatever you want to call it. I implore you to do a lot of historical research behind why wars start, and especially the most relevant ones. The conflicts in these regions have complex historical, political, and geopolitical causes that predate Bidens administration. Regarding Ukraine: The roots of this conflict trace back to Ukraines move toward closer ties with the West, its pursuit of NATO membership, and Russias long-standing interest in maintaining influence over former Soviet territories. While Bidens administration has supported Ukraine with military and economic aid, the decision to invade was made by Russian President Vladimir Putin, not the U.S.Regarding Gaza: The conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has deep historical roots tied to decades of Israeli-Palestinian tensions, territorial disputes, and broader regional dynamics. Bidens administration has supported Israel but has also pushed for a two-state solution to resolve the long-standing conflict. The recent flare-up in violence was triggered by actions on the ground, including attacks by Hamas and Israeli military responses, not directly by U.S. policy.Inflation/Gas: The Biden administration is not solely to blame for the current high inflation rates, although some of its policies have been a factor in the broader picture. Inflation is influenced by multiple global and domestic factors, many of which are beyond the direct control of any single administration. For example: \\n? Pandemic-related disruptions: The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant supply chain disruptions globally, leading to shortages of goods and higher costs for production and shipping. ? Global energy prices: Rising oil and gas prices, exacerbated by Russias invasion of Ukraine and the global energy market instability, have driven up the costs of fuel and transportation, which impacts the prices of goods and services.? Federal reserve policy: The Federal Reserve, which is independent of the president, plays a significant role in managing inflation through interest rate policies. Low-interest rates during the pandemic helped stimulate the economy but also contributed to rising inflation as demand surged while supply was constrained.You also need to understand that gas cannot be chalked up solely to one administration or one president. Multiple variables are involved. One such variable being global oil market dynamics. Please never look at politics as a black and white issue. Again, I dont support anyone. I wish we had a clean slate, but we dont. And I will always favor the position of perspective. Neither Trump nor Harris is our saving grace.","title":"Which Kamala Harris Should We Believe on Second Amendment?"},{"text":"Hes the Flake in Snowflake, AZ.

First off, Harris is starting with higher name recognition than the majority of other Democrats, due to being the sitting VP, which definitely helps to at least some extent (even if not all attention is good attention). Second, being in the national eye would mean their flaws were more closely scrutinized. It's actually quite impressive that Harris's favourability is rising exponentially despite being more closely examined (usually it would be the opposite).","title":"Kamala Harris is now slightly outperforming the \\"generic democrat\\" on favourability"},{"text":"Explain Marxism and how it applies here.","title":"Trump-Biden-Kamala is a setup"},{"text":"NYT: \\"Here's why that's bad for Democrats.\\"","title":"Kamala Harris is now slightly outperforming the \\"generic democrat\\" on favourability"},{"text":"I can only really throw my experience in on this.

Now, to start by putting my biases on the table, I'm a licensed social worker, and went through the educational system you described. With that in mind I obviously have my own feelings about the profession, but I want to use some of my insights from working within it to help explain why I don't think your idea would quite work. In order to do so, I think its important for us to first establish *why* the mental health system is in crisis. To that end, I think there's a strong argument to be made that this crisis is rooted in politics, not economics.To understand this claim, you just need to look at home mental healthcare and social service organizations are funded. Historically, most of this funding came from the state, but never at levels sufficient for the missions these organizations were tasked with. Social service agencies, serving people less likely to hold political power, and typically without strong public unions to represent them, have historically often been some of the first to face budget cuts. This means these organizations tend not to be able to offer the pay or maintain the staffing levels needed to do their job well. When a tragedy inevitably does happen because of these issues it rarely results in more funding, which would require expenditure of political capitol and might be unpopular with the public. Instead, the response from the political caste, which created this issue to begin with, is simply to impose more stringent rules on how organizations operate, those creating more work. Child Protective Services (CPS) is a perfect example of this in most states. CPS agencies are usually ludicrously underfunded and overworked, leading to a constant string of tragedies. However, despite funding being an *obvious* root cause of these failures, the response to tragedy is usually just a \\"tightening of the rules\\" over real change. Outside of public support, insurance has also played a role in funding mental healthcare, albeit begrudgingly. Up until the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed in 2010, insurance companies were not required to cover mental healthcare, and many chose not to. While the ACA was step forwards in promoting access to mental health support, it was critically lacking when it came to mandating insurance reimbursement. Simply put, while forced to cover mental healthcare, most insurers decide to pay providers at rates that are [unsustainably low](https://mhanational.org/blog/fix-foundation-unfair-rate-setting-leads-inaccessible-mental-health-care). If that weren't enough, the process for actually getting this reimbursement is often such a bureaucratic nightmare that it requires a significant expenditure of time to navigate, if not the outright hiring of billing specialists. For independently operating providers, that means dedicating an ever growing portion of their day to unpaid fights with insurers over billing, as opposed to actually doing their job. For larger joint practices this often means considerable pressure to maximize sessions and to pursue certain therapeutic approaches, even when those pressure might contradict their professional best judgement. Making matters even worse, insurers *constantly* break the rules about paying for treatment and doing so at required rates, because enforcement of that section of the ACA has been gutted by politicians. With this in mind, the solution to fixing the mental healthcare and social service crises is maddening simple: more money. Currently we estimate that [poor mental health is costing the American economy **billions** every year.](https://leading.business.columbia.edu/main-pillar-business-society/business-society/mental-health-cost) When proper mental healthcare funding is provided, research indicates that this ultimately [generates money over the course of just a few years](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2014/07/mental-illness-cost-benefit/). Simply put, these services will literally pay for themselves when properly reimbursed. The barrier here isn't one of profitability, its one of a lack of political will to gather tax dollars and pressure insurance companies. Now having established all this, lets talk about why simply lowering barriers to entry doesn't work well. Simply put, psychologists, councilors, and social workers like myself don't go through extensive training for no reason. We need that education to create a shared knowledge base, understand how to practice our craft without causing harm to our patients, and to try to minimize bias in our work. Our education also helps us to police the profession internally, and ends with us being tied to professional licensing boards that can punish us for malpractice, including full on banning us from working as providers. In contrast, when states have pursued lowered barriers of entry for mental health providers, it often leads to people taking those roles who are well meaning, but don't know what they're doing. They bring way too much bias, don't know how to go about providing good interventions, because they lack a grounding in theory, and at times can even actively harm the mental health of people they're working with. This is all the more an issue because most states who lower the barrier to entry use this as a [back door to insert religion into public life](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/05/24/texas-legislature-chaplains-schools/), by authorizing chaplains to act as providers. That's not to bash chaplains, I work alongside some wonderful ones in my current job, but the training they're provided, while extensive in its own right, isn't sufficient for someone to be a primary mental health provider.","title":"CMV: The way out of the drastic shortage of mental health service professionals in the U.S. is to drastically lower barriers to entry."},{"text":"I'm not saying that Harris is definitely worse than Generic Dem.

It was maybe 20 years ago. Oh, and the fake news heard about it. They said, it never happened. It never happened. And I didnt know who it was. It was a group that honored me as man of the year. The fakers back there, see the fake news. But they said  They said, oh  And they looked and, you know, they said it never happened. But I said, I swear to you, it happened.\\nIt did happen. I was man of the year. And I came and I made a speech and I said, why do you allow them to take your car business away? Why do you allow it to happen? Theyre taking your business away. And I didnt know too much about it. All I know is they were taking your car industry away from you. They said it never happened.\\nAnd lo and behold, somebody said, I remember the event. And then we found out and we had everything. We got the awards. We had everything. It did happen. But I gave a speech, which at the time was pretty controversial. We cant let them take your car business away. Its such an important business.\\nAnd you know its an important business even in times of war where they switch over. And it was really something. And I looked at that speech from, I dont know, its like 19, 20 years ago. And I could repeat it now without changing a word.\\nYou cannot let foreign countries, and a lot of the times our worst foes are our so-called friends, okay? You know, our friends, the European Union takes tremendous advantage of us. As an example, they give us cars by the millions. We dont have too many Chevrolets in the middle of European cities, okay? European Union is brutal. They dont take our farm products for the most part. They dont take a lot. But unlike Kamala, who always complains and doesnt do anything, I keep saying, why dont you do?\\nI saw Marsha the other day. Why doesnt she, why didnt she do it four years ago almost? And I say that, you know, shes on the border today trying just to, what a day for the border. She goes to the border today, and they just announced just before she got up to speak that more than 13,000 murderers from jail, solitary confinement people in many cases, were released.\\nBut I just say, lets go back. So we cant let them take our businesses. And were not gonna let them take our businesses. And you can control that so easily through good policy. Not her kind of policy, by the way. She changed her policy 15 times. No fracking. Oh, I like fracking. Defund the police. She wants to defund the police. Now, oh, I love the police all of a sudden. By the way, when anybody is into defunding the police even for a day during their career, they can no longer serve as President of the United States, I can tell you.\\nSo were not gonna let them take our businesses. And really, a lot of thats determined by our taxation policy. When China has to pay all that money, the people that liked me the best were the steel companies because I saved them. They were dumping China and others, but mostly China was dumping steel in here at levels that nobody had ever seen before.\\nAnd it was putting the steel companies out of business. I put a 50% and 100% tax on the dumping of steel and the steel companies thrived. I saved them, and you have to have the steel companies. So well do the same thing.\\nAnd you dont worry about it. Heres what you have to do. I only ask you to do one thing, and then you can sleep beautifully all night long, go to a job you love, and get a lot of money at the end of the week. You know what the thing is? Vote for Trump.

If they have a diagnosed mental illness or history of crisis (like involuntary commitment to a psychiatric hospital, or being arrested for having an episode), they go to the front of the line. If they're just having a hard time, they can be directed to support groups for things like grief, growing up with narcissistic parents, etc. after those with diagnoses mental illness and history of crisis are stabilized, they should be referred to support groups too. Also, primary care doctors should step up more to reduce the burden on psychiatrists. If someone knows what medications and doses work for them, they shouldn't be pressured to keep going to a psychiatrist every six to eight weeks until the end of time to keep getting refills. Refer to a psychiatrist for initiating medication and finding the right dose, then kick them back to primary care once it's figured out. Even better, let the pharmacists prescribe refills if the type and dose of medication stays the same for at least one year. If there's a major change, like removing or adding a medication, kick them back to psychiatry or primary care. Right now the paradigm is to keep the same patients for as long as possible and having appointments as frequently as possible. It should be stabilizing patients and then making room for new patients. The burnout is partially their fault because they're stuffing their schedules with so many unnecessary follow up appointments.","title":"CMV: The way out of the drastic shortage of mental health service professionals in the U.S. is to drastically lower barriers to entry."},{"text":"Rubbish","title":"Donald Trump Leading Kamala Harris in Five of Seven Swing States: Poll"},{"text":"Trump hasnt been president for four years, what era is she going to fix again?","title":"Kamala Harris for President | The Vice-President has displayed the basic values and political skills that would enable her to help end, once and for all, a poisonous era defined by Donald Trump."},{"text":"do you have any source for your statements?","title":"CMV: The way out of the drastic shortage of mental health service professionals in the U.S. is to drastically lower barriers to entry."},{"text":"Jesus was referred to as lucifer in 2 Peters.

Something like schizophrenia would likely need more training than mild depression.  It seems better to have a tiered care system, like with IT support.  You start at Tier 1 who are lightly trained but are trained to identify when a case needs immediate escalation.  If Tier 1 doesnt work, we get Tier 2 to take a swing, if that doesnt work we move to Tier 3, etc.  In that system weve optimized so people are only seeing the level of training they actually need which also means we can provide more help to more people.
