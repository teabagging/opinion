But four years ago, then-President Joe Biden halted the US exit.

My frustration has led me to believe we need our own hard-hitting figure that can say f_ck you, is sharp and can bully back.This is absolutely correct. This has been the Democrats' biggest weakness from a strategic perspective for quite some time now. Most Democrats with any amount of leadership have been unwilling to treat the other side as enemies, even as the other side treats Democrats as enemies. This needs to change immediately. The kind of conciliation we see Democrats offer habitually should only be on the table when the other side makes concrete unilateral concessions toward conciliation of their own - and the fact that a part of you is laughing at that notion tells you exactly how likely that is without any kind of genuine red-blooded primal opposition from us. Progressive agenda needs to be thrown on the f_cking back burner for now because clearly overwhelming voters in America dgaf about pronouns when theyre digging deep in their pockets to meet milk, eggs and bread in the grocery line. We need to start collectively acting on housing, inflation, jobs and healthcare. The anti-capitalism discourse must be ejected from our party. Not a single peep on DEI until weve consolidated power. Once we do then we can start thinking about incorporating progressive ideas into legislation. It is so f_king insane to me that we failed to adapt our strategy to maintain our territory on minority voters.You're wrong about this. Not because I think protecting trans folks or overthrowing capitalism is somehow secretly a winning issue per se, but because of the nature of our coalition. Simply put, we are a coalition of different issue groups whose primary bond is the idea that moving forward on the issues of one of the groups will ultimately be beneficial for advancing the other groups. Each group only has the power it has because it has worked, however remotely, in concert with the others. As soon as you start pruning issue groups, you are literally pruning your manpower for the remaining groups. Furthermore, moving your ideology to meet the demands of the electorate is the precise opposite of fighting and demonstrating strength/willpower, which was the exact thing you were right about. It literally doesn't matter how out of step we are about trans folks - IF we are willing to say \\"to hell with all of you, this is right and you can't make us back down.\\" On top of that, jettisoning your beliefs to chase some middle ground does nothing to actually win new people - the people who found your old positions discomforting aren't going to feel reassured, they're just going to assume you're untrustworthy because you don't stand up for something. Plus, public opinion can be changed if someone actually stands up to lead it; the relationship between public opinion and a leader's positions doesn't have to only flow one way (as can be seen, for instance, with how quickly the other side has embraced militarism against our allies based on the mere suggestion of it by their new god). On anti-capitalism specifically, trying to jettison that is a losing issue because capitalism as practiced in the United States has, for all its past successes, clearly failed to meet *this particular* moment, and when the economic shit from Trump's policies hits the fan, having critics of capitalism within our tent pissing out will put us in a better position than having them outside the tent getting themselves killed trying to do a dumbass revolution on their own. It's also simply a fact that we need to make reforms that take power away from the large capitalist institutions in media - and that's easier to do with anti-capitalists backing your moves (or, at least, not fighting your moves), rather than opposing them. Besides, you're never going to rhetorically out-capitalist the current opposition, regardless of how fraudulent their pro-capitalist rhetoric is, and as mentioned before it's not like you'll win any trust by retreating from a position you were believed to have held (even if it's not the case that you held that position). But all that was just one thing you were wrong about. The other thing you're wrong about is more implicit: that you only need a political party with the right attitude. Our strategy *must* be bigger than that. We are going to need to conduct no less than medium-scale economic warfare. We need to organize general strikes and tax strikes. (Yes, I am saying that we need to get a critical mass of people to risk the wrath of the IRS. I know how nuts that sounds, but we're up against literal Nazis, so settle down please.) It may be necessary to organize covert societies, just like the days of liberal organizing under the heel of Metternich in 1848 or the Romanovs in the late 1800s. If Trump really invades Canada or Panama or another ally, we may need to be willing to attempt to physically stop military vehicles, knowing the risk to ourselves (but with the organization to have our comrades nearby, capturing the video in order to spread it widely). I realize some of this shit sounds like stuff out a movie, but that's kind of my point - We *must*, we *must must must*, think outside of the normal course of political activity. I can't guarantee that anything I've suggested above will be an ideal strategy, but it's at least a place to start the conversation. If we leave this to \\"normal politics but we say fuck more and compromise less\\" then we are effectively just assuming that the other side will be unwilling or unable to antidemocratically consolidate power in a new regime, and that's a fucking stupid bet to make.","title":"Dems need a strategy overhaul + sanity check?"},{"text":"I read the title  in Optimus primesvoice","title":"Trump and MAGA must be stopped, no matter the cost!"},{"text":"I think you just named the one thing he and Joe Biden have in common.","title":"Trump's promise to end the Ukraine war in a day meets harsh realities"},{"text":"You know theyre introducing something that would ban masks at public gatherings?

Also on that date the World Health Organization finished assembling their disease response task force, which began gathering and sharing information. On January 5th, the WHO issued their first technical Disease Response Newsletter for the new outbreak, which reported everything that was known at that time, including that it was a potentially infectious respiratory disease, but that they were not yet conclusive cases of human to human transmission. .

Manufacturing is operating at like 70% capacityLike I'm not sure what you're insinuating by providing this figure with no context.

The most eye opening book I've ever read about terrible toxic people is \\"Why does he do that?\\" by Lundy Bancroft, a counselor who worked with abusive men (almost always court ordered of course) and in it there's a bunch of stories about all the ridiculous ways they would **purposefully** try to distort reality and manipulate others.One of the most insane examples is when they were doing some sort of reenactment/demonstration for some reason and all the men started chiming in with \\"helpful tips\\" about how to boss around their partners.  All these men who would claim they didn't do anything wrong and just \\"lost control\\" would have sober minded ideas on how to abuse better.Likewise lots of men would seem to have revolutionary breakthroughs, to deeply understand their problems and why abuse and anger wasn't the right thing. \\"Oh thank you for helping me\\" they'd say, only for them to sit down with the wives in private and hear about how the men would go home in anger, pissed off that they had to deal with the \\"bullshit counseling\\".It's not a perfect book by any means, it's mostly filled with personal anecdotes and his own unscientific insights but those anecdotes are still quite revealing about a type of person who exists.At the very least one idea sticks with me pretty well. He talks about how the abusive men he would deal with would say they're \\"out of control\\" and the wives would complain about being hit or having things destroyed and one thing he noticed is weirdly enough, the places that tend to get hit hard are areas that are covered up by clothing, and somehow the out of control men only seem to destroy things precious to their partner, never stuff *they* care about! Big lesson there, if a person can exert so much thoughtful control over how they hit you or with their own stuff then how are they out of control?? Go look at what actual uncontrolled meltdowns and stuff looks like, you'll see stories like autistic kids destroying their favorite toys or whatever. Imagine it like this, if someone claimed they were just clumsy and always dropping your precious things but somehow never dropped anything of theirs, would that be *just* clumsiness?

I've known at least one person who was accused of a sexual assault they did not commit and lost a lot as a result. Even setting aside losing your job or other \\"quantitative\\" reputational effects, it's just an awful experience psychologically. It's horrific to be at the center of an allegation like this and feel that everyone you know might now hate you.I do think it's worth noting that this goes both ways: accusing someone else of sexual assault generally carries massive costs for the accuser, too. In a \\"he-said/she-said\\" situation where there's no conclusive evidence either way, in my experience there's a split between a \\"pro-accuser\\" group and a \\"pro-accused\\" group, each of which is rabidly supportive of their favored party and rabidly opposed to the other side. A friend group might split down the middle, or social media factions might form around each person. Whether the accuser is being truthful and accurate or not, they'll be viciously attacked by members of the opposing group.Just as I know men who've been falsely accused and lost friends, I know women who experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment and didn't speak up because they were worried that if they did speak up against the person who assaulted them, they might lose half their friends. In at least one case, this led to the perpetrator harming other people in that same friend group.","title":"CMV: I dont see a fair way to approach sexual assault allegations"},{"text":"What good does blaming the people doing the damage do?

A full 4x times more often than the other categories. And those are the provably false cases. Another percentage of them are false but we can't know that. And you're thinking about it wrong anyway. The women who make up rape allegations are NOT victims; they are perpetrators who see any number of potential benefits. One of my best friends worked SVU in a major American city, and told me that female criminals will throw out an \\"I was raped!\\" at the drop of a hat if they think it will get them sympathy or leniency. Even if it's proven they are lying, nothing happens to them. It becomes a low-risk, high-reward proposition for them, so why not?\\nSadly, it seems common that victims of assault are often revictimized later.?\\nWhich is entirely a fault of how we talk about rape and the risk of rape and who we know become rapists. There's a notion that is pushed hard by feminists that any man has the potential to be a rapist in the right situation. The statistics show that if fundamentally false. Over 90% of rapes are perpetrated by serial rapists. They are degenerates who will continue to victimize until they are caught and put away. Women often worry about the consequences that speaking out will cause their violator and therefore don't report (because the rapist has gained their trust and confidence ahead of time). Most women never consider the fact that the entire scenario was a dupe to con them into silence. We need to fundamentally change how we talk about rape and justice for rape victims, because the whole \\"teach men not to rape\\" paradigm is allowing literal predators to roam free.?","title":"CMV: I dont see a fair way to approach sexual assault allegations"},{"text":"Yeah.

The SEC case is strong and has well-documented Musk's failure to make legally required disclosures.The SEC filing states that in buying Twitter in 2022, Elon Musk violated securities laws by amassing a large stock position in the social media company without filing the proper notification. The complaint said Musk waited 11 days before filing the required disclosure with the S.E.C.The regulatory filings are required so investors in the marketplace can monitor the moves of large investors and potential takeover bids. Because Mr. Musk did not disclose his position, he was able to continue buying Twitter stock at an artificially low price, the SEC said in its lawsuit.The move allowed him \\\\[Elon Musk\\\\] to underpay by at least $150 million for the additional shares before he belatedly disclosed his stake, the lawsuit continued.Musk's failure to comply with SEC disclosure law also harmed investors who would have been able to sell their shares at higher prices had Musks involvement been publicly known, the agency said. Former Twitter shareholders have also sued Mr. Musk, accusing him of fraud in a case related to his belated disclosure of his stake in Twitter.Martha Stewart was put in prison on obstruction of justice charges in conjunction with alleged securities violations.

Along with state and local governments. You can't rock the boat too hard. Along with different factions in the GOP not always aligned. Completely different contexts from Russia post soviet collapse or 1930s germany post world war 1 that others love citing when doomposting and what not. Most of the appeals courts are pretty liberal (where these lawsuits are being filed). And trump still needs the debt ceiling to be raised which is why he was upset with Johnson over the government shutdown debacle a few weeks ago. even republican senators are casting doubt on trumps one big bill being passed by April. And it takes time to fire and hire synchpants at the rate and volume they want. Congress has the power of the purse and the slimmest house majority in decades. I think that's where the \\"mandate\\" backfires. 1/3 of voting public didn't vote. out of the 77 million trump voters, 20 million were probably reactionary to inflation/try something different simple voting.Rocking the boat too hard 1) motivates people to become more engaged which is the opposite of what they want with midterms in 2026 (Damage will be done but not enough by then) and 2) disturbs the status quo that donors benefit from.We think of MAGA as this unified front, but technocrats and christian nationalists and the standard republicans that still exist (will only ever vote for republicans) all want different things so it's an interesting balancing act.Stay engaged and active in your local elections.

[...]  Judges who oppose capital punishment have likewise disregarded the law by falsely claiming that capital punishment is unconstitutional, even though the Constitution explicitly acknowledges the legality of capital punishment. These efforts to subvert and undermine capital punishment defy the laws of our nation, make a mockery of justice, and insult the victims of these horrible crimes.  The Governments most solemn responsibility is to protect its citizens from abhorrent acts, and my Administration will not tolerate efforts to stymie and eviscerate the laws that authorize capital punishment against those who commit horrible acts of violence against American citizens.**Sec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to ensure that the laws that authorize capital punishment are respected and faithfully implemented, and to counteract the politicians and judges who subvert the law by obstructing and preventing the execution of capital sentences.**And...(e)  The Attorney General shall evaluate the places of imprisonment and conditions of confinement for each of the 37 murderers whose Federal death sentences were commuted by President Biden, and **the Attorney General shall take all lawful and appropriate action to ensure that these offenders are imprisoned in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose**.  The Attorney General shall further evaluate **whether these offenders can be charged with State capital crimes and shall recommend appropriate action to state and local authorities.**That last bit is important because if they can't make it happen federally, they'll find a way for the states to, and with that is...Sec. 4.  Preserving Capital Punishment in the States.  (a)  The Attorney General shall take all necessary and lawful action to ensure that each state that allows capital punishment has a sufficient supply of drugs needed to carry out lethal injection.Even states that allow the death penalty have trouble getting the drugs for it because a lot of companies have refused to allow their products to be used for killing people.The whole order is pretty bad. They're going to pressure states to pursue the death penalty as much as possible, while ensuring they're all stocked and ready to push it all through. And they're going to push today's SCOTUS to flip precedents on capitol punishment.Sec. 5.  Seeking The Overruling of Supreme Court Precedents That Hinder Capital Punishment.

I genuinely don't think so. Conservatism in Canada takes multiple forms. The English speaking conservative movement in recent years is very nearly the same as the American one, to the point where they actively closely follow Trump, just look at the Truck convoys. It doesn't help that Trudeau and Biden are fairly aligned politically. Yes, conservative candidates in Canada are not exactly the same as America, as the two countries are in a very different situation politically and economically (like most large countries), but I'd argue that the political left in America is far more reactionary than in Canada (for good reason, you guys don't have healthcare and a lot of social benefits we have here). In fact, the issues most Canadians have with American conservatives is social policy, such as the healthcare system, nothing to do with \\"unlawful\\" or \\"too conservative\\", However, I would make the point that American conservatism is practically the same as Canadian conservatism nowadays, and if you take into account the more liberal portions of Canada (basically Ontario and Quebec), you'd still get more or less the same results in the elections. Quebec votes Independent (Bloc) most elections since the early 90's, so I'm not sure how much of a liberal presence you'd have. The oil provinces in Canada are forking over huge amounts of money to sustain the larger cities in Ontario, Quebec, and the Eastern provinces, not to mention the immigration issue, or the deep unpopularity of the Liberal party.Overall it's a dumb scenario, as Canada and America are two different countries, and a lot of things makes the merge an impossibility. No joke, your government wanted to close the border between our two countries a few months ago because of the sheer amount of extremists that are now Canadian citizens and who successfully crossed.

It states remote workers are affected but also says we are to report to our official duty locations. With remote workers, their official duty location is their homes. I think it was supposed to say teleworkers but someone goofed because the terms have been used interchangeably even though theyre very different per OPM. Furthermore, it states agencies are to terminate remote work agreements. That means the agency is paying to move the employee to an office. Thats expensive. My last paid move was over $40k in 2018. Terminating the agreement is a directed reassignment and a directed reassignment is at the agencys expense. So I really think this was either a ploy to show theyre doing something without actually doing anything or they meant to direct it towards teleworkers. Teleworkers are within commuting distance, remote workers dont have offices. Literally, my program has not had an office in 15 years. So wed have to find one and move 50 of us to it.

This is why Trump, then Biden both changed the rules around title IX proceedings.You also don't need a formal investigation or hearing at all, it is possible to cause massive reputational damage and then intentionally *not* report your claims through any official channel, resulting in consequences without any real investigation happening. We should be really careful about using inconsistencies to conclude that an accuser is lying. It's actually extremely common for witnesses or victims to get details of their stories wrong, even when they're telling the truth. And conversely, it is also possible for someone to be consistent even when they are lying. The problem with statements like this, is that they tend to be used in an extremely one-sided manner, without consideration for the fact that it creates a situation where you have someone offering potentially quite emotionally powerful testimony against someone else (that could sway a jury), in which you have then barred basically any effective response. If the testimony is affirmed by the evidence, that just proves it is accurate, if the testimony is contradicted by the evidence, then that doesn't mean they're lying either. What information is this testimony adding to the case, and why should the court even bother with it, if the integrity of it regarding the facts of the case is irrelevant? It's also common for investigators to believe incorrectly that a victim isn't acting \\"naturally\\" and must be lying, even when they're telling the truth. I'm not aware of any good evidence as to how common or not this, or any other attitude by investigators generally is. So, you're right, we should look at all the evidence - we should have a \\"period of inquiry\\". But we don't have to make that inquiry \\"painful\\" in the sense of pushing the alleged victim really hard and trying to find and press on small inconsistencies in their story. E.g., if she says she was wearing a brown sweater when she was raped, then later says it was blue, that's not a good reason to bring her in for 6 hours of grilling to try to show that she was actually lying all along; it's just evidence that her memory for small details cannot be fully relied upon.The problem is that this example is not in accordance with the types of issues that often arise. Inconsistencies can include things like blatant memory errors where the accuser honestly misidentifies someone (and isn't lying, but is making an accusation that isn't true, a dynamic that is often forgotten about in these discussions), jumbled timelines, influence from other people they talked to about it.This is also a generic issue with confessions, the central park five, for example, confessed to their crimes, and police departments have and still do use strategies to coerce these types of fake confessions to wrongdoing across all sorts of crimes. Nothing about this issue is particularly specially relevant to sexual assault, except for how we outside of the criminal justice system tend to feel about it. There isn't really any need to treat accusers in sexual assault or rape cases specially, when we just shouldn't take these types of admissions seriously in any instance.Not only that, but what is considered \\"painful\\" is often things as basic as questioning the account at all, or asking the accuser to give the account in front of the person they are accusing as well as the public as a whole, or discussion of things like the accuser's sexual history, which can sometimes be materially important to the case at hand.","title":"CMV: I dont see a fair way to approach sexual assault allegations"},{"text":"Oh I'm sure, I just meant for tonight.","title":"What executive orders did Trump sign on day one?"},{"text":"Cuban Americans got played","title":"Trump moves to end refugee resettlement and parole for Cubans, Haitians and Venezuelans"},{"text":"I explicitly remember someone holding up the diamond cutter hand sign and then lowering it down over their crotch to say it was a vagina.

It not only establishes birthright citizenship, but was also created to negate the Dred Scott decision, which is considered by some as the worst Supreme Court decision in US history.That being said, this is a dangerous road to go down, especially considering how Republicans will be looking for ways to consolidate power, abuse the legal/justice systems, and erode checks and balances.Where it may have seemed unfeasible before, if the GOP is successful in these efforts, it would make sense for them to continue targeting legal precedents, and even other clauses within the 14th amendment considering it's been cited in many cases over the years that have sought to protect American's civil rights.Which is why it has earned itself the label of \\"the cornerstone of civil rights in the United States.\\"Some constitutional scholars argue that it is one of, if not the most consequential amendment in our constitution.As many of you may know, decisions made in cases like Brown v. Board of education and Roe v. Wade invoked the 14th.Now, any attempt to amend, repeal or alter this amendment will be met with a score of legal challenges, but that certainly won't keep Republicans from trying.Almost every clause belonging to the 14th protects rights or privileges that Republicans have threatened to invalidate over the years.There's the citizenship clause, which we've already gone over.There's also the due process clause, which has been referenced often throughout this country's history, and extends protections for Americans from say, a far right, authoritarian regime intending to deprive them of their \\"life, liberty or property\\" without \\"due process of law.\\" Then there's the equal protection clause, which has been cited in countless cases and has also been the basis for many landmark SCOTUS decisions. As it suggests, the clause ensures equal protection under the law, or in other words, it makes sure that no person or group is denied the same protections under the law that others benefit from, while many of the decisions invoking this clause have addressed things like discrimination based on race, gender, and sexual orientation, as well as broader civil rights protected by the constitution. Hmm, I wonder why Republicans might want to challenge this one in particular.Then of course, there's the part of the 14th amendment about disqualification from office. It prohibits individuals, like Trump for instance, from holding office if they've engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States. Wow, it's looking more and more like a no-brainer for the GOP.There's also the privileges or immunities clause. Which is, I suppose, a lesser known part of the fourteenth. Its original aim was to ensure that citizens of each state were entitled to the same privileges and immunities as citizens of other states. Once you put all this together, it becomes obvious why Republicans might want to \\"reexamine\\" the amendment.For all of their conspiratorial whining about how this or that proposal will lead us down a slippery slope of \\"radical leftist\\" and/or \\"socialist\\" policies that will pose a threat to *their* beloved country, the only slippery slope im seeing is in response to empowering a bunch of far right extremists in positions of authority.","title":"Trump Plans to Put an End to Birthright Citizenship.

Biden's order was in response to Trump trying, and being rejected by the SCOTUS in 2020, to add a citizenship question to the census. Trump's current term will end before the next census so ultimately any attempt to do that again won't be his call. Biden had around 29 orders &amp; memos in his first 2-3 days in office. 9 reversals of Trump EOs in his first day, including rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement for example that Trump just reversed again today.To this point the main things I'm worried about are the potential tariffs as well as potential to set up detention camps for people they suspect are immigrants.","title":"Trump rescinds Biden's census order, clearing a path for reshaping election maps"},{"text":"It's already done by executive order.

The \\"one from each side\\" principle works precisely?*because*?it's fair and everyone knows what to expect. When someone breaks this unwritten rule, it creates uncertainty and forces other drivers to suddenly adjust their speed and position. That's both unsafe and inefficient.That's a matter of road design though. To road designers, understanding the drive to fairness is crucial as it allows them to channel good behaviour. As a driver though, it's very difficult to enforce this rule upon others. The best thing to do is to carry on following the rule behind the offending driver.Your approach basically rewards aggressive drivers and punishes courteous ones.This is precisely what I'd like to avoid. Honestly I'd agree with you if I thought honking made a difference, but the truth is that it doesn't. That's because people often honk when they're pissed off or when others are in their way when they're trying to do the wrong thing. There's no real way to express the difference when on the road. The study I provided relates to how expressing the drive to fairness can generate road rage.  \\n  \\nWhen I cycle, on the other hand, I am very different. I react with aggressive indignation when someone puts me in danger.

And this is not just legal repercussions. There are cases of people who have lost their jobs and who have been expelled from universities because of unproven allegations of sexual assault.You freely switch between sanctions caused by \\"a false accusation\\" to sanctions caused by \\"unproven allegations\\", but they are not the same - an accusation can be confirmed as false only when its falsity has been proven; if it is merely unproven, the accusation could be either true or false.This equation of \\"unproven\\" with \\"false\\" is reminiscent of the guilty/not guilty dichotomy from criminal law. Granted, innocent until proven guilty in a court of law is a fine maxim; however, inherent to the maxim is the notion that a court of law will be involved - so, if no court of law is involved, does the concept really apply?The same can be said of the standard of proof. In criminal law, charges must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but should a university be held to the same standard as the government? Should an employer?There are reasons why criminal law exists in its current form. Criminal convictions can lead to imprisonment, which is far more serious than the loss of a job or expulsion from university. And the high standard of proof serves also to protect the public against the government, which is obviously very important (an analogy can be found in First Amendment law, which binds the government alone).People who are trying to hide the truth or to cover up a lie often have trouble retelling a sequence of events.People who have experienced trauma often have trouble retelling a sequence of events. The assumption that such people are liars is, as far as I know, a key factor in the historical failure to take complainants who allege sexual assault seriously. It's rather awkward to see it repeated here.I don't see a way to avoid a painful period of inquiry once an allegation has been made.Is this not asking for the moon on a stick? And why are you worried about it as regards this particular area? Formal investigations are often painful to innocent targets, or to the victims of the matter under investigation.

For instance, going before its your turn at a 4 way stop may be unfair but is also likely not seen as a deliberate problematic action. The example I gave with the merge - where the person explicitly leaves the 'thru' lane to pass people in the lane that is clearly ending - only to demand the right of way to merge ahead - is a 'dick move'. Especially when accompanied with the taking of right of way from the justified person. These are vastly different situations and should not be lumped together. In taking your zipper merge example. I, as the driver in the 'thru' lane, have the right of way and by law am not required to allow the 'jerk' vehicle to merge in front of me.

When drivers follow fair rules consistently, it creates predictability that makes everyone safer. Your examples actually prove this point.Take your Australian merging example. The \\"one from each side\\" principle works precisely *because* it's fair and everyone knows what to expect. When someone breaks this unwritten rule, it creates uncertainty and forces other drivers to suddenly adjust their speed and position. That's both unsafe and inefficient.The shoulder merging issue you mentioned isn't about fairness vs efficiency - it's about poor education. Those drivers aren't being \\"fair,\\" they're just wrong about how the road should be used. The solution isn't to abandon fairness, but to better educate drivers about proper merging etiquette. If you feel that someone has wronged you or broken your trust, the best thing to do is keep the peace.This is a false choice. You can maintain fairness norms without road rage. When someone cuts me off, I honk - not out of anger, but to signal \\"hey, that's dangerous.\\" It's like training a dog - consistent feedback shapes behavior over time.Your approach basically rewards aggressive drivers and punishes courteous ones. Over time, this creates exactly the kind of unsafe, inefficient roads you want to avoid.

Giving full pardons to people who have been convicted by a jury is the ultimate in giving aid and comfort.\\n4. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment disqualifies anyone who has given an oath to uphold the Constitution and then gives aid and comfort to insurrectionists.\\n5. Trump has taken that oath. Twice.  He took it again today.Section 3.No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state, who, **having previously taken an oath,** as a member of Congress, or **as an officer of the United States**, or as a member of any state legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any state, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, **or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof \\\\[the insurrectionists\\\\].** But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disabilitySo, just a few hours after very publicly taking that oath, he very publicly gives aid and comfort to insurrectionists. Section 3, like all the other sections of the 14th amendment, is self enacting.  Nothing needs to be done if it is evident that the person either engaged in insurrection or gave aid and comfort to the insurrectionists.

In just 30 years, we went from Economic, Education, and Political powerhouse to Pre-Collapse levels due to greedy, corrupt politicians first trying to make themselves super wealthy then trying to keep everyone poor, ignorant, and manipulatable.As for your questions:Betraying the Country: No, Trump's betrayed the Deep State (Also called the Uniparty, the Democrats and Republicans bound together into a single party due to an interconnected web of corruption and bribery). Why? Because the Deep State's current move threatened to fuck with his money.On the Economy: Trump is a modern land baron. He makes the biggest chunk of his legitimate money from building and/or selling houses/buildings/roads legitimately. How does he do this? By putting enough money into the hands of the people to start buying your shit.Culture and Community: We know that, from the 1950s-1980s Soviet Russia was dumping massive money into Hollywood, and China from the 1990s on. We've literally been groomed for a Communist Revolution and the Deep State has spent 30 years tanking our economy to try to kickstart it. Those of us with 3 working brain cells and pattern recognition/cognitive state more advanced than a jellyfish know that Communism will not work beyond the individual community until Scarcity is solved. And going communist NOW will literally just be putting an American Hitler/Stalin/Mao/Putin in power, see us starved and non-straight/non-whites put into camps like the Uighur Muslims or put onto plantations owned by oligarchs and communists in congress.But most of all, we chose Trump because of 1 fucking thing: Every time the parties have made moves to try to cut his political throat, Trump showed that he is a stool pigeon. Look at both Impeachments and Jan 6. He threatens to start revealing the secrets of both fucking parties, and the Uniparty, and they back down. That means he must know where a lot of he bodies are buried. So all we have to do is make him enough of a thorn in the side of this nation's corruption that they make the move that actually makes him squeal like the fucking pig he is. And when the people know just how corrupt shit REALLY is here, we'll be able to force through an U.S. Constitution, not NATO, Article V, which literally wipes us down to the bill of rights and gives us a chance to rip out all the corruption, like weeds in a garden, and rebuild into what a land of the free should actually fucking be with minimum bloodshed instead of having to actually fight.","title":"Can someone explain to a European what is going on over there?"},{"text":"Also pardon them for anything they might do to J6 committee members in the next 10 years.?","title":"BREAKING: Trump is reportedly set to issues pardons for January 6th political prisoners as soon as TODAY.

Claiming there's a problem and then saying nothing is a problem in itself tbh.I'm pretty far left leaning so if anyone does not address the corruption and one sidedness of capitalism and claims they are a democrat, they aren't any better than the conservatives they condemn. They claim conservative manipulate through fear, yet they manipulate the highly emotional and talk of issues and then do nothing about it until its too late, or not at all.Anyone who further divides people aren't our friends, as anyone here knows. Its a constant pull until one side wins, yet both are pumped up through super pacs and claim to try and fix our issues (citizens united could have been worked to be reversed so many times, yet all we got was abortion reversed), yet they're paid by people who created our issues.In my eyes, this is what done against us on a daily basis to a point where it feels like a game.  Specifically?The mass wealth inequality, mass ideological subversion, fueling wars that encourage genocide, constantly undermining human value for profit (like encouraging an abysmal healthcare system), creating education that encourages dogmatic thinking towards America, pitting people against each other every cycle that further takes advantage of those who are susceptible to authoritarianism and those who lack critical thinking skills, helping to push propaganda through news cycles that don't address real issues, supporting the imperialism of America itself and other like minded countries, not addressing homelessness, the constant back and fourth on climate change and not pushing harder on laws that uphold our stances on climate change, destroying people who speak out against the danger of capitalism and also staging coups in countries that don't uphold the corruption of capitalism (I.e the 2009 coup of Honduras, my home country, under the presidency of obama, don't even get me started on other countries they've done this to), allowing countries to heavily influence our ideologies and doing nothing about it (remember all those youtubers and influencers who were proven to have received money from Russia and then... nothing?).Just a couple of reasons I, personally, don't see much difference between democrats and republicans. But like I said, I'm pretty far left. All I'm saying is, working class, unite.","title":"A group of computer security experts have written to Vice President Kamala Harris to alert her to the fact that voting systems were breached by Trump allies in 2021 and 2022 and to urge her to seek recounts in key states to ensure election verification."},{"text":"With Clarence leading the charge","title":"Trump signs executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship"},{"text":"Hope you're eating good tonight, Dearborn.","title":"Trump cancels sanctions on Israeli settlers in West Bank"},{"text":"The people in power have made it clear theyre not interested in compromise or coexistence, they want submission.","title":"The Trump Resistance Wont Be Putting on Pussy Hats This Time"},{"text":"so the DOJ is going to investigate itself?","title":"Trump pardons 1500 J6ers.
