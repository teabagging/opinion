Hillary was a terrible candidate in 2016, buy you forget that as much as she wasn't good, she was loathed and despised as well. Anyone running against her would have won, including Donald Trump, who she allegedly helped in the primary because she thought she'd beat him most easily. Sanders is not going to win an election in the US for president, the American people aren't ready to elect an acknowledged socialist. Every nursing home in the country would awaken its population to make sure of it.In 2016, the 3rd canadadate running in the Democrat primary, Jim Webb would have beaten Trump, IMHO. He was well-spoken, moderate, military veteran, senator, etc. He had populist policies, like Trump, but more left leaning and without the baggage. Trump wasn't the powerhouse he became yet.\\nNow, your next mistake is deeming Trumps first term as disastrous. You don't have to like the man to give him credit where credit is due. Failing to do so will continue the slide of the democratic party and it's lack of recognition of the common man. Prior to covid 19, the US economy was among the best it's ever been. Unemployment was almost all time lows, wages going up faster than inflation. Trump was getting nations to normalize relations with Israel, working on peace with North Korea... Russia was afraid to invade Ukraine, he turned out to be a profit with NATO nations getting them to kick up funding and try and get off Russian oil and gas. Covid19 was a disaster world wide, and his handling of it is defiantly mischaracterized. Few people who say his response was disastrous offer real plans that would have been better. There were massive deaths world wide, many American death were people that had covid when they died, not died because of it. There was a famous case where a guy was loved as a covid death when he had a motorcycle accident. Also he was opposed at every turn anytime he tried to set policy. Remember when he killed flights from China and Europe and Nancy Pelosi was calling him a racist bigot and encouraging people to goto Chinese new year in huge crowds? Or when he tried to reopen the economy after the initial 2 week shut down and was stopped by pretty much every blue state governor? Or how he gets blamed for covid deaths that governors like Cuomo and others were putting highly infectious covid patients in nursing homes (with some of the most vulnerable people)? Covid deaths were also higher under Biden.... 384k under Trumps 1 year, 462k under Bidens 1st year of covid alone. I'm not about to sit here and say Bidens response to Covid killed people or the like, but i am pointing out that any idea that a different response would have produced different results, when deaths went up after Biden took office demonstrates that the disastrous response you think it was is really propaganda. Then there's the elephant in the room, the 2020 election.... remember Trump got more moves than any sitting president in the history of our nation. The Vast majority which came in on election day at polling locations. Biden beat him, mostly with mail in ballots, there's real questions how many of those mail in ballots would have been people showing up if they had to, many of them were people who casually mailed in a ballot because it was at their house and didn't care enough to show up. There's alsonthe fact that the laws and policies were changed in many places to allow for mail in ballots, many of which weren't legal processes and while people will tell you this was proven wrong in court..... it wasn't. It was ruled the petitioners didn't have standing to complain, not that they were right or wrong. Texas v. Pensylvania should have been heard by SCOTUS to put all that to bed and they punted it..... by the way, PA determined later on that they didn't follow the proper procedure for that after the decision was meaning less. Trump may or may not have beaten Biden in 2020 without covid, well never know, but the 2020 election certainly strengthened Trump amongst his base. There's no way he would have lost to Biden in a rematch. Just based on his energized base. Harris was part of an administration that was seen as unfavorable. Its odd to me that so many party loyalists can't see this, but the only people that \\"liked\\" the Biden admin were democrats. Harris had no shot against him, likeable or not just by being part of the Biden admin. Throw on the fact she wasn't liked by her party in 2020 when she didn't get a single delegate vote. And the lack of primary completely deflates any talk about \\"saving democracy\\".

With an aging population, the worker-to-beneficiary ratio has been decreasing, making Social Securitys finances increasingly unsustainableIt's also incredibly unfair to workers in it's current form.  older generations tend to be wealthier than the younger generations paying for their Social Security benefits. This creates a system in which the federal government effectively redistributes hard-earned dollars from poorer workers to wealthier retirees. Notably, high-earning retirees can receive up to $60,000 in Social Security benefits annually, regardless of their other income and assets.They have some great suggestions about how to fix it, my favorite of which is a flat benefit scheme.

In fact, she doubled down on a political aesthetics that aligned her with the image of the Democrat elite--she shared her stages with a bunch of out-of-touch rich celebrities.How might a Democrat have won in 2024? Very simple: The Democrats would easily have won if they ran a left wing populist whose goal was to fight for the working class and push through transformative changes that would restore power to the working class. I.e. \\"On day one of my campaign, I will begin the work of setting up a FREE HEALTHCARE FOR ALL program.

And the administration of said blockade allowed Israeli fishing vessels to openly deplete fishing stocks off of the Gaza coast while keeping Gazan fishermen confined to a coastal fishing zone that is replenished by those stocks further out to sea. Which in turn disrupts the food economy in Gaza making more people dependent on the government aid run by Hamas and making Hamas seem like the people saving them from stravation at the hands of Israeli actions. And considering over 50% of Gaza is families who fled Israel's independence in 1948 as part of the Nakba, the locals overwhelming see the blame on Israel, not Hamas since in the day to day, it's Israeli restrictions that people are suffering from malnutrition. Even those Gazans who don't support Hamas still see Israel as the ultimate case since the economy is strangled by 15 year blockade and that that means that 50% of Gazana don't remember a life without the blockade.","title":"cmv: the unity of the Palestinian movement, especially regarding Oct 7, is to its detriment and the detriment of Palestinian lives"},{"text":"I can believe it.

The political groups around the pre Israeli independence war were largely anti monarchists groups while all the neighboring countries were to have monarchies imposed on them by the British government per the McMahon agreement.

The groups were also almost completely organized around the local peasant class rather than urban elites because their simply wasn't actually a urban or local rural nobility structure on that side of the Jordan at the time. They were the vast majority peasant workers working absentee landlord land or just communal village land. So the local identity of Arabs in modern Israel and Palestine was always directly tied to the land and not the surrounding regional powers. And the land had been solidly idenitfied as Palestinian for a generation by the 1940s with multiple companies, papers, regional groups, organized around that identifier. So overall it seems like an unsupported assumption that Arabs from Palestine would be accepted into monarchist regimes with explictly anti monarchist and anti feudal structure political organization (since the feudal absentee landowner were the ones who sold them done the river) would be welcome in new Monarchies. And that countries (outside of Jordan) that were largely based on urban Arab identities would accept specific regional peasants as anything more than additional mouths to feed. Especially without compensation from the Israelis who forced 700k refugees at once on them. And based on my experience with families who left the region in 1948 during the Nakba, the still living members have a strong and developed identity as Filistin (Palestinian in Arabic). So it seems like a clear no-brainer to me that the identity of Palestinian as seperate from other Arab groups like Syrian, Lebanonese, and Jordanian happen clearly before 1948 and crossed religions lines (the families I talked to were from mixed Christian and Muslim villages before 1948).So it seems like kinda European style blindness to actual regional culture identifiers that has been extended well into the present even though the past 80 years alone have made it clear that Palestinians have a clear and permanent identity now. It just seems like an otherization argument where the \\"others\\" don't \\"realy\\" have meaningful differences between each other there for \\"we\\" are justified as seeing them as a single overarching group. At its core it seems like an argument claiming all Africans are the same group.","title":"cmv: the unity of the Palestinian movement, especially regarding Oct 7, is to its detriment and the detriment of Palestinian lives"},{"text":"Biden isnt worse than Trump, but he isnt that much higher than him at this point","title":"'Kids for Cash' Judge has sentence commuted by President Biden"},{"text":"And then let's impose a hiring freeze.

People not having to take time off of work was likely the largest contributing factor to the record turnout. As well as mail in voting making it easier than ever to vote.I would also like to highlight the voting shift at a macro level.Biden secured [81,283,501](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#:~:text=Biden%20received%20the%20majority%20in,Bush%20in%201992.) votes in 2020, and Kamala secured 74,983,555 currently. 81,283,501 - 74,983,555 = 6,299,946 less votes.Trump in 2020 secured [74,223,975](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election#:~:text=Biden%20received%20the%20majority%20in,Bush%20in%201992.) and 77,269,255 currently. 77,269,255 - 74,223,975 = 3,045,280 more votes.They undid it, and the only real reason is laziness and complacency.I feel like this assumes all of the people who voted in 2020 and didn't in 2024 would have voted for Kamala. I think there's much more at play than \\"laziness and complacency\\" among voters who voted in 2020 vs now. I also think Trumps increased share of voters indicates that some people switched from voting Biden in 2020 to Trump in 2024.

It would have certainly been an uphill battle, but Kamala Harris was wildly unpopular, even in the Democratic primary 2020. In my mind, the issue is that Trump had to lose voters for Dems to have a shot, and there was nothing an opponent could say or do to make him lose voters.This part just isn't true. If 'didn't vote' was a candidate, it would have won the popular vote and electoral college. No one got excited about Kamala Harris.

For example, a single Walmart employee making $20 per hour likely wouldnt qualify for food stamps, but a single parent with four kids making the same $20 per hour might. The difference isnt about the job or Walmarts pay but about family needs.

Conahan pulled funding from a county-owned juvenile detention center there and agreed to send juveniles to a for-profit facility in exchange for payments, a scheme that netted him and fellow jurist Mark Ciavarella nearly $3 million.Conahan, who was convicted in 2011, had been serving his sentence in a Florida facility and was due to be released in 2026. But he was placed in home confinement in 2020 due to the pandemic.All those commuted by Biden on Thursday had been placed in home confinement for at least a year, the White House said.? READ MORE: Kids For Cash scandal, explainedDespite Conahans involvement in the scandal, news of his relief was welcomed by Marsha Levick, chief legal officer and cofounder of the Juvenile Law Center, an advocacy group that was among the first to raise concerns about the scheme.While we believe in a compassionate justice system that rejects an historically hyper-punitive approach to holding people accountable, we also hope former judge Michael Conahan has reflected on the harm he caused to thousands of kids, she said in a statement. We would like to see the same kind of compassion and mercy extended to children nationwide who continue to suffer harm from our juvenile and criminal legal systems.Also among those released was ex-Philadelphia Police Officer Rafael Cordero, who was sentenced to 15 years behind bars for passing sensitive information about drug investigations to his half-brother  a member of a Kensington-based heroin trafficking group.Corderos attorney, Jack McMahon, called the commutation fantastic, saying in an interview that Cordero got a way more severe sentence than he deserved. Thats a long time coming, if you ask me.Clemency was also granted to people who had been prosecuted by the U.S. Attorneys Office in Philadelphia for dealing drugs, including heroin and crack cocaine; defrauding Medicare; and committing financial fraud. The total number of local residents granted relief could not be immediately determined. The White House did not specify where all of the 1,500 people were from, and a spokesperson declined to provide those details.Bidens clemency announcement came after mounting criticisms from criminal justice advocates and progressive groups that had called on him to issue more pardons and commutations, especially after he pardoned his son Hunter Biden on federal gun and tax law charges. At least a dozen advocates in Pennsylvania signed on to a national letter on Dec. 6 urging Biden to take action in the final weeks of his administration.In addition to those whose sentences were commuted, Biden pardoned 39 people who were convicted of nonviolent crimes. The White House said his actions represented the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history.White House press secretary Karine-Jean Pierre signaled on Dec. 2 that Biden would announce more pardons at the end of his term, a typical practice among presidents leaving office.The 39 individuals who were pardoned  many of whom are parents, veterans, teachers, health-care professionals, or otherwise involved in their community  received relief for nonviolent offenses and have been rehabilitated, according to a White House statement Thursday.Many of them have used their experiences in the criminal justice system to inspire and encourage others, the White House said.Elected officials and advocacy groups from the Philadelphia area applauded Bidens decision.This historic grant of pardons and commutations, and the corresponding restoration of rights, sends a powerful message in support of fundamental fairness and furthering meaningful criminal justice reform, said U.S. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D., Pa.) in a statement.Scanlon and Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D., Mass.) and James Clyburn (D., S.C.) led 64 of their colleagues in signing a letter urging Biden to use his clemency power in the final weeks of his administration.Robert Saleem Holbrook, executive director of the Abolitionist Law Center, said that hes glad that Biden issued these clemency grants but that he wishes more action was taken earlier.But they can move forward now without that threat of returning to incarceration over their heads, Holbrook said of the commutations. And the 39 [pardons], its good. Its a good start.","title":"A former Pa. judge involved in the Kids for Cash scandal is granted clemency by President Joe Biden"},{"text":"It's!Obama, Clinton, Biden, W, Trump!&lt;!Clinton would be #1 but sex pest drags him down!&lt;","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I feel that in WI","title":"House overrides veto, passes law that strips power from incoming Democrats"},{"text":"The worst part about having an accent is that people automatically assume that you're unintelligent and that you don't have a clue what you're talking about, then will act shocked and awed when it becomes apparent that you do.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"The great replacement is real.","title":"Biden Races To Sell Off Border Wall Parts Before Trump Takes Office"},{"text":"I hate that weve come this vibe ^^^","title":"The end of House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries' press conference"},{"text":"Imagine working your whole life and then getting fired by that hair?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Yes.

I had no positive or negative feelings about Israel at all until earlier this year. I supported Israel when they were attacked on October 7, 2023. But since then, its become crystal clear that Israel is committing genocide in Palestine under the guise of self-defense. Theyve attacked Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, and now Syria. The goal isnt security, its territory expansion. The historical parallel is closest to Nazi Germanys annexation of Czechoslovakia. First it was Sudetenland. Then Hitler collapsed the Slovakian regional governments and installed a German puppet state. Then it took over the Czech region outright.And yes, Im directly comparing Netanyahu to Hitler, the 37th government of Israel to the Nazi Party, and Israel to Germany. Hitlers argument was that Germany was bombed by enemy countries 20 years prior during WWI because they were jealous of Gods special people, and they needed to expand into and ethnically cleanse new territory to get more lebensraum (living space.) Its exactly the same argument Netanyahu uses today.Your post about the security need for Israel to expand into Syria despite various international treaties is exactly how Hitler took over Czechoslovakia despite the Munich Agreement. Youre trying to frame Israels actions in realpolitik terms. Realpolitik is [the approach of conducting diplomatic or political policies based primarily on considerations of given circumstances and factors, rather than strictly following ideological, moral, or ethical premises.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realpolitik) The opening of your post is designed to get readers to move past the ethical considerations and just talk strategy. But I refuse to engage. It reminds me of a joke. Would you have sex with someone for $1? No? How about for $100 billion? Yes? Then we know what you are and now were just negotiating a price. Neville Chamberlain set aside his morality and began negotiating a price. His appeasement of Nazi Germany was a terrible mistake then just like appeasement of Israel is a terrible mistake today.Edit: Let me add in one more detail here. Realpolitik only works if a country has leverage. The US can act immorally throughout the world because it is extremely rich and can afford an outrageously powerful military. Russia and China can do that too to a lesser extent. Israel is not in that position. It is not a superpower. Israel was created and has survived so far through the largesse of the US and Europe. It relied on a basic moral argument: Jew were persecuted in the Holocaust and the US and Europe have a responsibility to help them. Israel is able to easily bully its powerless neighbors today. But it can't survive against more powerful enemies without the US's support. By massacring its weak neighbors, Israel has given up the moral high ground and has lost support in the US and Europe. But it also doesn't have the military and economic leverage to stand on its own either. It's like an obnoxious teenager. A small child is cute and gets a ton of support from adults even if they behave badly. An adult is strong enough to stand on its own and can even be a threat to others. A teenager is no longer cute, wants more independence, but also isn't able to survive on their own yet. Ultimately, Netanyahu overplayed his hand, likely to get out of a personal domestic political jam. He's acting like Hitler, but doesn't have the industrial might of Nazi Germany to back him up. A large part of his power comes from the backing of the US, but his actions have infuriated the American public and destroyed Israel's reputation. Without American support, Israel can't survive against more powerful enemies. Now Donald Trump is in power, but he's a fickle friend. A large part of his base consists of America First isolationists who are opposed to military interventions abroad. That means Trump might leave Israel hanging just like he did to many other American allies. Netanyahu needs to keep attacking other countries to avoid prison in Israel. It's all or nothing for him. But the center-right to far-left of Israeli society would probably benefit by getting rid of him, stopping the genocide, and getting back in the good graces of the US and world. Right now, Israel is a massive liability and an extremely evil one at that. You can only be a bad ally for so long before you're left alone to live with the consequences.","title":"CMV: The public outrage against Israel occupying the buffer zone between Syria and the Golan minimizes the real security concerns with the transition in Syria, and it is unfairly uniquely targeted towards Israel."},{"text":"Kinda pathetic that moderates and Biden bros just give up democracy after losing a single election like they had no plans for political activism past electing biden.

Let me clarify and redirect the discussion back to the central issues at hand,1. The Dhimmi SystemYou repeatedly refer to the dhimmi system as if it were a permanent, unchanging institution that defined all interactions between Muslims and non-Muslims across centuries. While the system did impose restrictions, it is worth noting that:The Ottoman Empire officially abolished the dhimmi system with the Tanzimat reforms in the mid-19th century. This occurred well before the rise of modern nation-states and colonial ambitions that shaped contemporary geopolitics in Palestine.\\n([Source](https://rpl.hds.harvard.edu/faq/dhimmi?))\\nYour attempt to use a pre-modern, pre-reform context to justify modern conflicts is intellectually disingenuous. Let us not forget that the Ottoman Empire, while imperfect, also allowed religious minorities significant autonomy, particularly compared to the treatment of Indigenous populations in colonial contexts.2. Going Off-TopicYou list events spanning over a century and across various geographic contexts, but we are discussing Palestine specifically. If you want to dig into the complexities of Muslim-Christian-Jewish relations across the Middle East, thats a valuable but separate conversation. However, cherry-picking violent events while ignoring broader historical trends of coexistence and mutual influence only exposes the weakness of your argument.\\nI am more than happy to engage in a debate about pre-modern times, but I suspect it would only highlight the fragility (sad) of your narrative.3. Deir Yassin and Gaza TodayYour defense of the Deir Yassin massacre rests on an inherently contradictory quote: \\"I believe that most of those who were killed were among the fighters and the women and children who helped the fighters.\\"Lets pause on that: women and children who were helping to defend their village. The notion that this justifies their deaths is chilling and mirrors the same logic used today to target children in Gaza under the guise of \\"military necessity.\\"\\nThe intentional framing of entire communities as combatants simply for existing under occupation is not only immoral but directly echoes the kind of state-sanctioned violence you are defending here.\\n4. Propaganda AccusationsYou lean heavily on claims of Arab propaganda surrounding Deir Yassin, yet ignore the well-documented psychological warfare tactics employed by Zionist militias to induce mass Palestinian displacement during the Nakba. Deir Yassin was not an isolated incident but part of a broader campaign of terror.\\nRather than dismissing survivor accounts as propaganda, we should examine why Palestinians who stayedsuch as your reference to a grandmotherwere reduced to second-class citizens, denied land rights (this is insane if you read about, but im sure you couldn'tcare less), and subject to systematic discrimination even within Israel.\\n5. Misplaced ComparisonsYour attempt to tie Palestinian resistance to historical events like Khaybar or Lebanons civil war is a blatant red herring. These are unrelated conflicts with distinct dynamics, and invoking them does little to address the core issue: the ongoing displacement, disenfranchisement, and subjugation of Palestinians within a territory they have inhabited for centuries.Your narrative, though passionate, is riddled with distortions and selective omissions. It may satisfy certain ideological predispositions, but it collapses under the weight of historical scrutiny. If you wish to continue this conversation, I suggest narrowing your focus to avoid the scattershot approach you've adopted here.","title":"cmv: the unity of the Palestinian movement, especially regarding Oct 7, is to its detriment and the detriment of Palestinian lives"},{"text":"Well you won't believe the treat they have for you in a couple of months","title":"'Kids for Cash' Judge sentence commuted by President Biden"},{"text":"Got my Christmas bonus at work today!

The British Embassy in Manila is delighted to celebrate two major milestones in UK-Philippines renewable energy collaboration.   Over two consecutive events, the Embassy underscored the United Kingdoms commitment to driving sustainable energy solutions in the Philippines and supporting its transition to cleaner, greener power sources.  On November 20, the Embassy hosted a celebratory dinner reception to highlight the partnership between Citicore Renewable Energy Corporation and Actis, a UK-based infrastructure investment company through its Southeast Asia renewable energy platform.  This dynamic collaboration involves the development of four new wind farms across Luzon and Visayas, with a total capacity of 380 megawatts.  Backed by an equity investment of $150 million, this partnership marks a significant step forward in expanding the Philippines renewable energy capacity. The projects, which secured offtake agreements through the Department of Energys Green Energy Auction Program (GEAP), exemplify the potential of partnerships to advance clean energy initiatives.  The following day, on November 21, Actis celebrated the groundbreaking of the Terra Solar Project in Nueva Ecija, which is set to become the largest solar energy project in the Philippines. This project, developed by Solar Philippines New Energy Corporation, is supported by Actis monumental USD 600 million equity investment.  The Terra Solar Project will provide affordable, reliable, and sustainable power to millions of Filipinos, reinforcing the UKs role as a key partner in the Philippines renewable energy transition. The groundbreaking ceremony highlighted Actis long-term commitment to sustainable infrastructure and clean energy in the Philippines.  His Majestys Ambassador to the Philippines, Laure Beaufils, said:    The United Kingdom is proud to be a partner in the Philippines renewable energy journey. These investments reflect our shared vision for a sustainable future and underscore the strong ties between our two nations. Projects like these not only provide clean energy to millions but also create opportunities for innovation and progress in the fight against climate change.   Both events demonstrated the transformative impact of UK-Philippines partnerships in renewable energy. The Embassy also celebrated Citicores achievement in securing $12 million in UK investment through its IPO, further solidifying the UKs support for the Philippines clean energy ambitions.  Together, these initiatives symbolize the shared commitment of the UK and the Philippines to innovation, sustainability, and a greener future for all.!ping ECO&amp;UK&amp;SEA","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"he pardoned the kids for cash guy.  joe biden isnt a good man.  he also let trump win.  dude is a loser","title":"Biden commutes roughly 1,500 sentences and pardons 39 people in biggest single-day act of clemency"},{"text":"I'm gonna need the Brian Johnson/Luigi Mangione discourse to be wrapped up by tonight.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"It's all just Republican propagandaMy statements are in [brackets].

His \\"legacy\\" is destroyed anyway.","title":"'Kids for Cash' Judge sentence commuted by President Biden"},{"text":"Also Israeli and I disagree. Attacking a regime that did nothing to attack you is not only wrong, it's bad from a national security viewpoint. The best way for Israel to secure its Syrian border is through diplomacy with the new regime.That is true, the problem is that there isn't a stable regime in Syria. Currently the many areas of Syria are all ruled by different factions which can act unpredictably. While they have established a transition government it will take time untill they will be able to centralise and rein in all the different factions. Until then treating it as one \\"regime\\" isn't accurate.  it's going to be painful to Israel regardless of whether Israel holds some small bits of territory here and there.I don't think you realise the value of the Hermon Mount, it's not just \\"some small bit of territory\\", it allows control of the entire Golan Heights and the foothills of the Anti - Lebanon mountain range, including Damascus. It is arguably the single most strategic piece of land in the area.  Right now, the new regime has no reason to attack Israel and every reason to seek cooperation.Again, there isn't really a \\"regime\\" right now and I believe Israel is more afraid of random groups trying to take advantage of the situation rather than a group like HTS.  Attacking them changes that. You can't expect a country who is truly threatened by Israel to seek peaceful relations with Israel.Let's be honest, these groups were never going to be chummy chummy with Israel. Regardless of our strikes and new occupation, we are still occupying the Golan Heights and they are still Sunni Islamists. There's no need to pretending like they were just about to offer us a comprehensive peace. I also think that a country threatened by Israel is less likely to attack and more likely to seek peace. If they thought they could have a chance at standing up to us why seem peace? Not that I think these actions were supposed to be against the HTS or the transition government, I think they were meant to stop weapons and the strategic position falling into the hands of dangerous elements, which honestly benefits the HTS.  You know they aren't doing it for real security reasons. On one hand you have Netanyahu who would do anything to escape trial, conveniently starting the engagement in Syria a few days before he was set to testify in court, and actually using it as an excuse to seek a delay.I have no love for Netanyahu but don't let your hate for him blind you. Saying that he \\"conveniently started it\\" a few days before his trial is ridiculous, he did this move they day Assad was deposed, which happened to be a few days before his trial. Also just because the government is shitty and corrupt doesn't mean they don't have decisions done from real concerns from time to time, I think this time is one of those.","title":"CMV: The public outrage against Israel occupying the buffer zone between Syria and the Golan minimizes the real security concerns with the transition in Syria, and it is unfairly uniquely targeted towards Israel."},{"text":"Gross profits are the profit they have before paying employees and other costs like rent, health insurance ect.After paying all costs owners are left with $6 billion or $0.02 per $1.00 spentYou comment is grossly misleading?","title":"CMV: Billionaires Arent ImmoralTheir Wealth Reflects Value Creation at Scale"},{"text":"Should their not be any value ascribed to the owner that either paid or personally provided the training and who put up the money?","title":"CMV: Billionaires Arent ImmoralTheir Wealth Reflects Value Creation at Scale"},{"text":"If you read the lines, I am advocating for more than just protest...","title":"House overrides veto, passes law that strips power from incoming Democrats"},{"text":"What bullshit.

Cousin asks what's wrong. Lady hesitate and says everything is fine. Goes home after a while and comes back a couple of hours later crying. Tells my cousin her preteen daughter had been \\"sick\\" and asks if my cousin will come over. We look at each other somehow knowing something was majorly wrong. They go outside and talk for a min. Cousin comes back in and asks me to come outside. Gives me the jist: \\"she says her daughter has been acting weird and speaking in different voices for awhile and she's been eating her shit and being violent\\" my mind goes to she's having a mental episode. Neighbor begs us to just come in and see her. We hesitate but she's crying hard at this point and doesn't know what to do. We reluctantly agree. We walk over and go inside. It's the middle of July and they have no AC so it's hot in the house. We follow her down the hall and the temp drips by about 30. Every fiber in body is telling me to turn around and run but my morbid curiosity keeps me going. We make it to her bedroom door and the mom takes a min. To open it. Finally opens it. It's dark and dead quiet. She turns the lamp on and we're standing at the threshold looking around. Don't see her anywhere. my cousin looks to the right and screams.

And economically, the idea of oil prices, wars, middle east conflicts affecting the economy have become normalized in a way they were not then.So with that reassessment, it's now more popular to think Carter was a decent president who tried to do some good things e.g. stimulus and deregulation, but he was a victim of events e.g. Iranian revolution and second oil shock.","title":"CMV: Fairly or not, Joe Bidens legacy as a president will be seen by most contemporary Americans as one of failure."},{"text":"Just shows that how easy it is to bribe US politicians.This jackass put childeren in prison for personal benefit but obviously he still has friends.And those friends talked with Biden staffers and Biden followed the advice of those staffers.","title":"'Kids for Cash' Judge sentence commuted by President Biden"},{"text":"Im against it.","title":"What is your opinion on demonic possession?"},{"text":"I wish more articles featured him smiling.","title":"'Ladies' man' Barron Trump is winning over NYU classmates and 'even liberal people like him'"},{"text":"Demonic possession is real.

However, the free market solution is an illusion simply because consumers don't have information or control. There is a distinct power asymmetry which means the larger a corporation gets, the more they can impress their will on the people, without much recourse. The response of 'people can just boycott' doesn't work when you are the defacto option. \\n3. The things I mentioned weren't legal or illegal. They just hadn't been dealt with in law yet.

That's what allowed them to get a stronghold in the industry. Now that they are fighting cases across the world, driver earnings are down to less than what they were making before Uber, and rider fares are back to what it was earlier, if not more.

The West Bank is the now fifty-seven-year \\"temporary\\" occupation that tends to get the most attention, due to the extensive civilian settlements and military administration that many, including Israeli human rights groups, describe as a regime of apartheid. Land has been expropriated, access to resources as basic as water has been limited, and much of the local population lives under military governance without civil rights or due process. Though there is debate about whether Gaza (at least until late last year) should be described as occupied, many attribute the rise of Hamas and the formation of the situation there to the conditions of Israel's \\"temporary\\" occupation there up to 2005, with similar conditions to the West Bank. In the past, Israel's \\"temporary\\" occupation of the Sinai included the displacement of local residents and the construction of Israeli civilian settlements, and it took a war in 1973 (and an international oil embargo) for Egypt and its allies to pressure Israel to the table to negotiate peace and a withdrawal. There is also the occupation of the part of the Golan heights that Israel annexed in 1981. Perhaps the more closely analogous situation, however, would be Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and the eighteen-year invasion that followed. There, too, there was a civil war into which Israel intervened, in that case with the aim of expelling the PLO from south Lebanon. In its initial campaign, it killed some 20,000 people and backed local proxies who, under its protection, carried out pogroms in Palestinian refugee camps among other terrorist violence inflicted on civilians in that territory. One enduring consequence of that invasion and occupation is that some Shiites in south Lebanon formed a militia to resist the Israeli aggression, i.e., Hezbollah, which many view as a net negative for the region and its stability. When many folks around the world now see Israel rush into Syria, beyond the strategic territory of the Golan even, they can't help but feel like they're seeing a rerun of a show they've seen a few times before. And many express concerns based on that past experience.I don't know what the future holds. Perhaps Israel will neutralize certain offensive weapons capabilities, establish security agreements with the new government, and withdraw. But given the Israel's track record with this sort of thing, I don't think it is unfair for international audiences to raise concerns about the aims and scope of Israel's occupation of Syrian territory until that happens.","title":"CMV: The public outrage against Israel occupying the buffer zone between Syria and the Golan minimizes the real security concerns with the transition in Syria, and it is unfairly uniquely targeted towards Israel."},{"text":"And she lost because she couldnt do the hard thing that was necessary.

Could America seize Tijuana with their military and expect to have no inflation of conflict?Israel should focus its effort on securing its own border from inside their country, rather than looking out over the surrounding lands to see what can be taken. This is really hurting Israel's claim to be a nation in defense; if your defense requires claiming more territory that's no longer a defense really, it's an offense. As they do so, surrounding countries will increasingly react out of fear that they could be next to suffer the wrath of the super powerful and brutal Israeli armed forces. Countries that fear extinction or loss of significant territory will continue to radicalize and the cycle of violence will escalate further, causing more Oct 7 like events. Based on Israeli government's words and actions, it does seem like it is the case that Israel's long term goals include acquiring more land.If Israel came out flat and said \\"we are on an expansion campaign because we feel the surrounding governments are weak and we can seize power\\" maybe people would be angry but at least nobody could accuse them of deceiving.

The UN buffer zone is there to prevent attacks directly on the buffer zone known as the Golan Heights, which is a buffer zone manned by Israeli troops, right? But if the former UN buffer zone is now manned by Israeli troops, there is still no buffer zone between Israeli troops and the possible attackers. Or does Israel expect the UN now to occupy a new buffer zone between the Israelis and the Syrians?If that doesn't happen (and I don't expect it will), it shouldn't matter from an Israeli perspective whether the attacks happen on Israeli troops in the original Golan Heights buffer zone, or in the former UN bufferzone. Taking the former UN buffer zone does not enhance security for Israeli troops at all. In fact, given that this can easily become a pretext for Syrian militants to now attack the Israeli troops in their newly occupied Syrian territory, I would argue it makes Israeli troops less safe than before. Golan Heights were the somewhat accepted status quo. This is not.But perhaps that is the goal of Netanyahu.

The best way for Israel to secure its Syrian border is through diplomacy with the new regime. If the new regime declares war on Israel, it's going to be painful to Israel regardless of whether Israel holds some small bits of territory here and there. Nothing Israel can reasonably capture is of enough strategic value to offset the relationship losses with the new regime and the rest of the world.Right now, the new regime has no reason to attack Israel and every reason to seek cooperation. Attacking them changes that. You can't expect a country who is truly threatened by Israel to seek peaceful relations with Israel. It also undermines the legitimacy of Israel's  recent wars when we attack a country who did nothing to us, as opposed to October 7th and the relentless bombing from Hezbollah.Finally, I want to express my exasperation in people feeling the need to cover for our terrible government. You know they aren't doing it for real security reasons. On one hand you have Netanyahu who would do anything to escape trial, conveniently starting the engagement in Syria a few days before he was set to testify in court, and actually using it as an excuse to seek a delay. On the other hand you have the crazies Ben Gvir and Smotrich, who probably just want to conquer as much territory as possible and annex it at some point.

If yes, then these mom-and-pops wouldve become history anyway at some point as its the consumers right to decide who to give their money to.2.

A lot of these countries eventually become resource producers or tourism centers - ie those mom and pops go away anyway.EDIT: just saw your edit. They cant be called extra legal if theyre illegal.

It's contested because Syria claims it for itself and so does Israel. You seem to agree with Syria but that doesn't make it any less contested. Contested means this.  \\n  \\n\\\\ If Israel didn't have a long, long, long, **long** history of taking land for \\"security concerns\\" and then never giving it back, people wouldn't be so mad.Well Israel has a long history of also giving back land for peace. Look at the Sinai with Egypt. That was occupied by Israel no? Look at Gaza (before Oct 7). That was disengaged from in 2006 no? Look at southern Lebanon (before the recent war). That was occupied and then disengaged from no? It seems to me that, if anything, Israel has been willing to exchange land for security when the conditions allow for it.\\\\ Do ya think Israel is ever gonna give back the \\"buffer zone\\" to Syria, who owns the land?What I think has little relevance. I wrote what I think in the post. About this I really don't know because it depends on HTS and who they decide is their biggest enemy and who they want to cooperate with. They are at a crossroads of history. Will they cooperate with the Iranians against Israel? Will they keep fighting the Iranians? Will they accept any Israeli help in fighting the Iranians? I think all of these points are potentially on the table, but really if they are smart about it they should focus on reconstructing their country so that it may be free from threats internal and external as opposed to fighting well establish foreign armies. If you're asking if there's going to be a push from the right to settle those areas then the answer is no. A considerable part of the arguments for settling WB and Gaza is that Jews used to live there, it's part of the ancient kingdom of Israel, so if Jews want to live there they should be able to.

Who is covered. In the US, people mostly either get their insurance from their job, from Medicaid, or from Medicare. Universal health coverage would mean making sure everyone is covered by *something*. This is probably the easiest part to fix, since only a small percentage of Americans are uninsured. You could close most of the gap by just getting all unemployed, homeless, or otherwise poor people on Medicaid or something similar. But given how red states obstructed Medicaid expansion, even this would be a non-trivial political hurdle. 1. What procedures are covered, and who decides whats covered. Is it just catastrophic insurance, or gold plate? Is dental and vision included in this? How do you decide whether to cover something or not? How do people which insurance they have, if theyre allowed to even pick all? At some point, you will have to either say no or tell the person to pay a lot of money, since healthcare is a scarce resource. 1. How much it costs. Whether its through copays, premiums, and/or taxes, at the end of the day society needs to pay the doctors, hospitals, and administrators for your care. How do you negotiate with these workers so that you dont pay out the nose for healthcare? How do you account for the fact that if people demand more healthcare, the price will naturally rise? Will healthcare get worse if you try to make it too cheap? This is probably the hardest to tackle, because truly and permanently lowering healthcare prices while retaining (most) of Americas quality of healthcare would require restructuring things like how doctors are even trained.  \\nThe most annoying thing for me is when people implicitly argue that having the government take over everything will automatically lower prices substantially, or when they imply that we can just raise taxes on only millionaires to pay for our healthcare. And thats not even considering the fact that most people would be pissed off if the government forcibly took away their current insurance and replaced it with something different (even if its strictly better). This happened a lot in 2020 when Sanders and Warren used sleights of hand to argue that healthcare expenditures would be easy to deal with when the math just doesnt work out like that.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I wonder why we dont see this on FOx News!","title":"Ex-FBI informant Alexander Smirnov pleads guilty to lying about the Bidens"},{"text":"Nah, KS is a good place to raise a family and live.

Pretend? I'm not going to apologize for some of these pardons/commutations, but Biden passed more legislation before he hit the midterms (most of it middle class and union-friendly) than Trump did in an entire term. Trump had two major pieces of legislation, 1) a multi-TRILLION dollar tax cut where 83% of it went to the top 1%, and he \\"paid\\" for it by putting it onto the national debt, which he increased by about 25%, which all of us will pay for for decades; and 2) Warp Speed, which he only did, reluctantly, after trying to pretend for months that covid either wasn't serious or didn't exist. Compare that with Biden who basically did all the things that Trump promised while running for his fist term but never even attempted - an infrastructure bill, union-friendly laws, a return of manufacturing, lower drug prices, etc. Trump TALKED a great game about helping the middle class but Biden actually DID the very things that Trump promised.","title":"President Biden commutes sentence for former Dixon, Ill.

You're also far more likely to just be asked to leave than arrested, if you are somehow caught in the vast emptiness of the back country.More to the point, you can't claim that all transactions that billionaires engage in are consensual and non-coercive if some transactions are impossible to be non-coercive. The significance of these transactions matter. If we apply some standard where any non-coercive transaction results in immorality, then every single person on earth is immoral because either indirectly or directly every transaction can be traced to some degree of coercion. It is possible for someone to willingly work at an agreed upon wage, and for that employment agreement to be coercive, because not having that wage would risk death.This isn't really the case, though. Not having *a* wage might result in death, but not being employed by the billionaire specifically doesn't necessarily result in death. We also have to consider that many billion dollar companies do not rely on exploitative labour in this way. Tech is a great example, where the workforce commands lucrative wages and can produce extreme value for owners. Someone with an in demand skill-set worth $150k/yr isn't going to starve if one particular billionaire doesn't employ them.

I bid everyone to read the book called 'Allied Wartime Diplomacy' to understand how actual propaganda ie atrocity propaganda works to mobilize the population for war. They did the same in WW1, the same was done in WW2 and they are doing it again. Corpse factories of dead citizens used as meat wave attacks (trying to undermine the civilian population of the enemy), babies killed with bayonets, women raped and killed, breasts cut off, cannibalism, gas attacks, mass graves, innovative methods to disintegrate bodies into thin air (so that no one wouldn't ask further questions about the bodies) etc... Stuff like these are tales as old as time. You can find them being used even today. And the easiest way of identifying a liar is by looking at those who are propagating this filth for their own profits. And it's almost always the governments in the West and their handlers. The British had an entire department working for this in WW1&amp;WW2 and beyond.

He also suggests some prior training in abstract algebra, but he's mostly bluffing. * Hayashi, *Econometrics,* requires a working knowledge of multivariate calculus, linear algebra, and probability. Some training in mathematical statistics is recommended. He is not bluffing.* Greene, *Econometric Analysis,* expects all four of multivariate calculus, linear algebra, probability, and mathematical statistics. He's not bluffing either. * Romer, *Advanced Macroeconomics,* assumes multivariate calculus.  But Romer is too easy.* Sargent and Ljungqvist, *Recursive Macro Theory,* wants you to have exposure to analysis and even a little functional analysis.* Stachurski, *Economic Dynamics: Theory and Computation,* is best absorbed with a full semester of analysis under your belt, and develops second-semester analysis (functional analysis) within the text. In brief, to be ready for grad school in economics, you should have training in* Multivariable calculus \\n* Linear algebra (at least one semester, preferably two)\\n* Probability and Mathematical Statistics  (yearlong sequence)\\n* A first course in analysis\\n* (helpful) some exposure to ideas in topology and functional analysis (but these are not strictly required)Real analysis is useful primarily as training in how to read and write proofs. But the substantive concepts in analysis (and topology, and functional analysis, and even measure theory) are *substantively* useful in static, dynamic, and stochastic economics; in micro, macro, and econometrics. It is not \\"just\\" signalling, it is substance too.That said, I think people can go overboard, especially people who haven't actually taken any graduate economics courses.

The?[federal tax benefits](https://news.bloombergtax.com/tax-insights-and-commentary/elon-musks-5-7-billion-stock-gift-had-some-surprising-benefits)?of his donation amounted to about $4.6 billion, or almost exactly 30 percent of his adjusted gross income  the maximum he would be allowed to deduct.

It would've been awkward if I admitted you changed my view before you were sure of what you were saying. Great job, !delta. The biggest factors for me were the 42% approval rating amongst Republicans in his state, and your point about the Midwest states largely voting as a bloc. I think I'm not quite so sure about your other points however. While the economy seems to have recovered well under his leadership, those graphs look similar for the federal government, and Kamala still lost on that. The idea that Trump couldn't attack Shapiro for things the federal government did is, I think, valid, but not in the way you suggested in that last paragraph. If just any state governor was immune to Trump's criticism, then there would be several replacements for Kamala that could've won. I think Shapiro is substantially better equipped to deal with Trump than most other state governors because Shapiro held strong Democratic and Republican support in a purple state with a split government (Republican legislature). He's genuinely a liberal, not a DINO or even really a moderate, but he's able to gather respect of Republican voters and work with a Republican legislature. Altogether, that makes him wiley. Trump could try to say Shapiro would fuck up the border and bring more inflation, and Shapiro can appeal to the fact that he actually listens to and works with Republicans, so he's not gonna do anything radical.  I think it'd still end up being close, but I'm now convinced Shapiro would've won.","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"Hate and fear is one hell of a drug.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 12, 2024"},{"text":"Terrible idea.

More and more money needs to get taxed from less and less base which to some degree stalls out consumption among younger generations and leaves them in a more financially precarious position. Since its based on the 35 highest earning years and when you first filed for benefits you can have ex. millionaires getting paid out up to $58476 annually (with cost of living adjustments to come) after they file at 70 and that hardly seems necessary to prevent those particular people from living undignified lives in desperate poverty which is nominally the point of the program. A bit over a fifth of the entire budget of the federal government goes to social security alone so its competing quite successfully against many many other priorities that some people may prefer.\\nIt seems to me like the effective transfer of money from poorer younger generations to generally wealthier older generations is a bad idea. Ex. if you can support a younger person who is sick or uneducated to become healthy or skilled then that can benefit society for the duration of their health/use of those skills during which theyre more productive, which could be a really long. But by giving it instead to older people who have already retired and dont have as long to go you dont really get much of a raise in productivity over a career but instead elevated savings and more consumption of goods and services that they need or want.\\nIdk maybe Im just cynical about it as Ive seen my dads old gajillionaire boss brag about how he was maxing out social security and someone else insisting that they would collect every penny of it available to them all the time so that none of the money would be available for the government to spend on (and I quote) the blacks. That and given that its precariously funded itll probably blow up before Im in a position to get mine but Im sure to pay out increasingly for it in the meantime which is annoying.\\nAs counterpoints it has helped a lot of people elderly or even not so elderly who had to cash out in a pinch avoid disaster when other income streams werent available or enough, and it being available to everyone surely helps make it a more popular and resilient program to getting cut than it it were more narrowly targeted.

You are romanticizing wealth creation as a product of innovation and hard work, are deliberately ignoreing the profound systemic barriers that prevent equitable economic participation.**Voluntary exchange:** True voluntary exchange requires genuine economic agency, which is systematically undermined by generational wealth, structural racism, educational inequity, and concentrated economic power. A worker 'choosing' between minimum wage jobs and potential destitution is not engaging in a freely negotiated transaction, but surviving within a constrained economic system. Your response to this has been 'They can go live in teh woods' or start their own business. Both of which are optoins that only someone who is very naive would suggest. I can go into more detail here if you really cant understand why living in the woods or starting one's own business might not be possible for a single parent of 2 who is struggling to make ends meet.**Philanthropy:** The philanthropic angle mentioned is also quite disingenuous. Billionaire \\"charity\\" represents a minuscule fraction of wealth extracted through labor exploitation, tax avoidance, and market monopolization. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, for instance, operates as a strategic tax shelter that allows continued wealth accumulation while providing a veneer of social responsibility.**Taxation:** This claim severely obscures the reality of sophisticated tax avoidance strategies employed by the wealthy. Yes, the rich give a lot of tax. But AS A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR WEALTH, they contribute next to nothing. Elon Musk paid 3.6% in federal taxes between 2014 - 2018, while his net worth grew by $15b. And this is doubly true for companies. [In fact, 10% of the S&amp;P500 paid absolutely no tax in 2023](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp-500-companies-paid-no-tax/), and this includes companies such as Tesla, AirBnB and Pfizer. Corporations and high-net-worth individuals routinely leverage loopholes, offshore accounts, and complex financial mechanisms to minimize their societal contributions.You have way too many points in your CMV, and all of them are fundamentally misguided.

My aim isn't to flip you completely, but maybe to convince you to be more open about other options.2. Wealth Encourages bold risks that benefit societyThis statement is true - but is not evidence for why billionaires need to exist. This role existed before billionaires. Mostly banks, motivated by profit, but also regulated by government, made loans based on ideas and business plans. Bankruptcy exist as a way to forgive those who take risks and fail. Only condition to fulfill your 3 cases is that wealth is created, not that it's held by a singular person. Capital for innovation could be just part of a bank, or government programs for small or medium businesses, grants for universities. Philanthropic impact, even by billionaires are done through charities, which the billionaire only acts as a middleman for. Reinvestment into business is done at the business level, not at the individual billionaire level. Tesla takes their earnings and reinvests, Elon Musk does not take his personal money and reinvest into Tesla since it's been public.3. The wealthy contribute disproportionately to taxesSimilar to above - yes this statement is true, but not an evidence to why billionaires need to exist. Progressive tax brackets stops much sooner than CEO pay. If we wanted to expand the brackets, or add new brackets where after maybe 10M you're taxed at 90% you could justify people getting 10M in salary. The marginal difference in tax dollars collected between one person making 10M/year and 20 people making 500K a year is minimal. One is much more likely to produce billionaires the other is not.Wealth v income - I agree here a bit, but capital gains should be higher, like muuuuuch higher. People might say that would also discourage investment, but I think having your $100k sitting in a bank is worse than having 100K invested, making 10K and getting taxed 9k, so you make 1K... because 0 dollar is less than 1 K, people will still invest.Similar point as point 2 - billionaire is not a requirement. Only wealth creation is required for public programs. Billioniares just work as a middleman between the wealth and the \\"programs\\" that fund things.   \\nConclusionMost of the benefits you cite on points 2 and 3 from having Billionaires actually does not require billionaires for it to be true. Wealth can be created, distributed differently, and these things will still hold. There are side effect to having billionaires such as extreme inequality. There is a causal relationship between inequality and crime (gini coefficient and crime). I don't think having billionaire is all bad or evil, but i think it is a tradeoff of pros and cons. Once you take away some of the Pros you mentioned as I don't see them as real pros of billionaires, but only of wealth creation, the calculus may change, or I would at least posit you to re-examine your stance, even if you end up at the same conclusion, maybe you'll have a weaker conclusion than before..","title":"CMV: Billionaires Arent ImmoralTheir Wealth Reflects Value Creation at Scale"},{"text":"\\"You also endorsed him in the end and then we're a faithful vice President to him for four years.\\"I don't think this is as convincing as we'd like.

One is that he is very popular, both in general and among Trump voters:[https://archive.ph/9Ai9J](https://archive.ph/9Ai9J)[https://archive.ph/20241107112928/https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-governor-josh-shapiro-polls-20240919.html](https://archive.ph/20241107112928/https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-governor-josh-shapiro-polls-20240919.html)If you're operating on the assumption that you need to take votes from Trump to win, I think he's the most likely candidate to be able to do that. On top of that:?Given that winning the election probably required winning the popular vote by?*at least*?3%Josh Shapiro is probably the most likely candidate to break this convention. As mentioned, he is extremely popular in Pennsylvania, which is the most important state to winning. That should give him an advantage in the election math, meaning he probably doesn't need to win the popular vote by quite as much. On top of that, if that logic holds, he likely has favour across all of the midwest swing states, which have voted together presidentially in every election since 1988. If he wins those three states, he wins the presidency.   \\nWhat about the economy? On Josh Shapiro's watch, Pennsylvania is doing quite well economically. [https://usafacts.org/topics/economy/state/pennsylvania/](https://usafacts.org/topics/economy/state/pennsylvania/) . That gives him something to point to in terms of building an economic plan.But honestly, I think it may be as simple as any choice that was not Trump or the previous administration would get a strong advantage in the election. Trump can't attack Shapiro effectively on the border because he has nothing to do with it. Trump's most effective attack line against Kamala is also gone. He can't point out that Shapiro said he wouldn't do anything different from Biden, and he can't say \\"Why didn't you do it already?\\" Honestly, I've largely convinced myself.

You can't just up and one day try to sort of stop talking about LGBT issues and expect that everyone thinks you've dropped hardcore advocacy for niche issues. It just doesn't work like that. The Ds had already given themselves a really deeply ingrained brand it will be impossible to lose this brand without the D platform really seeking to distance itself from hardcore advocacy.So yes, the DNC wasn't hyper focused in the few months during the campaign, but by not distancing themselves, it still felt like they were to a LOT of people.The best thing that the Ds could do would be to distance themselves from mixing kids in with these issues. Start really pushing back (not just being silent) against the story / reading time stuff with kids (you know what I'm talking about) and that kids should be encouraged to make permanent changes. Those are wildly unpopular for a lot more of America than Ds would like to acknowledge. And given the recent scientific findings, it's not scientifically backed that kids should make permanent changes anyway (and the more these findings get disseminated the more broadly and more deeply this view will grow). The UK just banned drugs that aid in this because even the most activist scientific researcher could not torture results of their own study enough to support the idea that it's beneficial and so declined to publish their results.And I'm not trying to be inflammatory, but anyone familiar with graduate research knows that these studies are typically pretty biased (for various reasons - there was recent commentary I saw where someone was complaining that they had to site research from someone who they knew was going to be a reviewer to get a favorable outcome; one paper specifically noted this as a reason for citation!).","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"It's also because of Citizens United forcing today's would-be leftists to pander to corpos in order to win elections while billionaire dark money flows to the right.

Why is Zelensky and Biden pushing for WW3 so hard before the new administration?"},{"text":" Mutual Agreement: Wealth accumulation in a free market relies on voluntary exchanges where both parties agree to terms in advance. Customers choose to buy products or services, and employees agree to work for wages. This is a mutually beneficial relationship, not coercion.This is probably the heart of any debate on the inherent morality of wealth accumulation, and it's certainly a matter of significant debate over economic systems. The counterargument would be that participation within the market economy under capitalism is functionally mandatory, due to the need for food and shelter, and due to the fact it is impossible to lawfully obtain these things (barring charity) without either owning capital or selling labor.There is no choice to leave the market entirely and survive independent of it, and therefore the relationship to it is involuntary. The customer must purchase products and services to live, and thus must seek employment for the wages necessary to make those purchases. To reject this is to threaten their survival. It is coercive.To tie this to the thesis, someone who has accrued $1,000,000,000 in wealth in contemporary US currency must have benefited from a very large number of these relationships. That wealth is therefore obtained through a large number of involuntary exchanges.The only moral defense is that perhaps these relationships were relatively less immoral than others, but I think this is a naive approach. In a coercive relationship, morality is judged by the extent to which the coerced participant benefits, relative to other such relationships. But to obtain such quantities of wealth requires a desire to maximize the benefit for the coercive partner. In a complex system this can involve tradeoffs i.e. a business can lower the price of goods but must offset this with lower wages.And to maximize profits (required for such wealth accumulation) this is only done for a specific purpose, such as undercutting the competition until such a point that the market will support raising prices (but not wages) without negatively impacting profit.There have always been moral philosophies which seek to frame the accumulation of wealth as a moral act, where the very act of accumulation is seen as a noble pursuit. But these are created with purpose to defend wealth. In a framework where morality is determined by humanist principles wealth at scale requires large amounts of immoral acts.","title":"CMV: Billionaires Arent ImmoralTheir Wealth Reflects Value Creation at Scale"},{"text":"Pelosi will never relinquish her money making","title":"Democrats Are Overdue for New Leadership"},{"text":"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/s/ZYbMFk4pRx","title":"CMV: Billionaires Arent ImmoralTheir Wealth Reflects Value Creation at Scale"},{"text":"Thats what makes me angry at pelosi we need younger leadership the old timers need to step out the way if there will ever be change pelosi is in her fucking 80's and the guy she wants is nearly 80 himself its time and they need to understand this if they ever expect support from their voters again after this whole fiasco","title":"Comer backs Ocasio-Cortez for top Democrat on Oversight panel"},{"text":"Milei devalued the Arg peso at the beginning of his term for that very reason.

I am currently in camp 3 (work for mega corp, paid comparatively well) but frequently dream of running off to camp 1 (live in the woods).The billionaire only exists when enough people are willing to choose their enterprise to work. The employee must get value or they will choose another alternativeThis argument again presumes the employees have a choice in their enterprise, and in return get \\"value.\\" The choice presented to us is: pay to live. Pay for the roof. For the Transport. For the education. For your family. For your healthcare. This is not a choice, it is an implicit threat. If you fail to produce enough money to sustain a decent existence, it is chocked up to individual failure and lack of tenacity or value. It implies meritocracy and a certain fairness to this system when instead it often comes down to a game of chance. A game of place and time. Malcom Gladwell's Outliers deals with this question.\\"The billionaire exists\\" completely outside of this system. More specifically, the centi-billionaire almost unanimously exists outside of this system. So those individuals that own over $100B almost never came to it without significant hand outs, either by birthright, or by significant charitable contribution from some pre-existing aristocratic network of wealth. To maintain that wealth, they must colonize natural resources and extract the value of their workers to create that \\"creation at scale.\\" All of this to enrich themselves to have more financial influence than most small nations. With no upper limit on how much they should acquire or how it should be leveraged. These are the personality traits of a sociopath.These systems contradict each other and those with the most capital spin a very convincing tale of meritocracy to cover the tracks of exploitation.","title":"CMV: Billionaires Arent ImmoralTheir Wealth Reflects Value Creation at Scale"},{"text":"She is smart and savvy, just not with the right goal for what the majority of the dem voters want.","title":"Nancy Pelosi Actively Working to Tank AOCs Bid for Top Committee Role"},{"text":"This sub used to be about economics and now its just about politics.

I said, \\"And, to be clear, that's basically what I mean by realistic. As long as your suggested candidate is, or has been, a Democrat, or a left-leaning independent, and there is some reason to believe they'd run if they thought they had a shot, feel free to bring them up in the comments.\\" Regardless of how it's defined, I don't think anyone could plausibly argue Josh Shapiro isn't a realistic choice lol. He was almost the VP choice. So let's say your general scenario occurs. There's a snap primary around the DNC, and Shapiro wins. I'm doubtful that Trump's campaign would agree to a mid-October debate with Shapiro, especially if there was already a debate in August with Shapiro. Even on Fox News. Trump is aware he doesn't perform well in debates against competent people and he knows his polls naturally improve after slumps. In fact, I think if Shapiro was his opponent, he wouldn't even agree to the debate in August. He thought Kamala would be easy and that's why he went along with that one. So, I'm not going to grant you this hypothetical mid-October bump. However, I think your point about the polling has validity to it. You're pointing out that the Emerson poll I touted was very far off in terms of the actual vote. True, but it didn't have anyone outperforming Harris either except Biden. Just about everyone except Biden trailed Trump by 6-8 points. The real distinction between the hypothetical Dems was the number of undecideds. 8% were undecided in a race between Kamala and Trump, while 16% were undecided between Trump and Shapiro (likely due to fewer people knowing who he is). This is a factor I didn't consider in my opinion much, but it counts against me clearly. If Harris was down 6 with only 8% undecided, then she'd need to win 75% of undecideds to win the popular vote. Whereas Shapiro was down 8, but with 16% undecided, meaning he'd only need to win over 50% of undecideds to win the popular vote. Given that winning the election probably required winning the popular vote by *at least* 3%, then, if this poll is accurate, Kamala was likely doomed from the start unless she could flip Trump voters, while Shapiro would still have a chance if he won about 70% of undecideds. Based on the results, if we assume this poll was accurate, Kamala won about 70% of those undecideds (or likely won some Trump voters  and a slightly smaller percent of undecideds).  Plus, he gets a bump in his victory chances due to his popularity in PA. Might not even need the 3% popular vote victory to win the EC. So based on numbers alone, there's an argument to be made that Shapiro would have won.And, as you've pointed out, since Shapiro was not part of the federal government, he could point out the flaws with the Biden administration without coming across as a hypocrite. Alright, you might be just about to change my view. Bring it home. Go beyond numbers and generalized ideas of his ability to air grievances about Biden. Explain to me why he's able to convince voters that he could fix the economy where Biden couldn't, or why he can make America great while Trump couldn't.","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"I dont think if Apple allowed androids to have blue texts they would lose a significant portion of their wealth.

Workers create surplus value (the difference between the value of what they produce and their wages), which is appropriated by capitalists as profit. This exploitation is masked by the wage system, which presents the relationship as a fair exchange.Scaling profits often intensifies exploitation, as it requires larger pools of underpaid labor or monopolistic practices that reduce competition. For example, while Walmart may claim thin margins benefit consumers, its low costs often rely on poor wages, precarious working conditions, and aggressive suppression of unions. Additionally, unequal power dynamics means that employers wield significantly more power than employees, which undermines the fairness of \\"mutual agreement.\\" These power imbalances are structural, not incidental, and perpetuate inequality.2. Innovation and technological advancement are the results of collective social effort, including publicly funded education, infrastructure, and government-supported research (e.g., NASAs role in early space technology, or the European Union's approach to funding medical research). When billionaires \\"invest,\\" they are often leveraging public resources to privatize the gains while socializing the risks/losses. Philanthropy becomes a tool for shaping society according to the donors priorities rather than democratic needs.The concentration of wealth in private hands often stifles progress by prioritizing profit over societal benefit. For example, life-saving drugs may be priced out of reach for many because of profit motives, despite the wealth of those funding their development. Or alternatively, billionaires have co-opted much of the global talent in stem cell research with vast private funding to develop life prolonging treatments that will become private IP under proprietary private corporations. as opposed to publicly funded research which hopes to cure lifetime disease for the benefit of the general population.3. .The fact that the wealthy pay a significant share of taxes does not address the root problem of how their wealth was accumulated. Taxes redistribute a portion of the wealth created by workers but do not challenge the exploitative mechanisms that generate inequality. Even when taxes fund public programs, these programs often serve capitalist interests (e.g., subsidizing industries, maintaining infrastructure for commerce) rather than addressing working-class needs.4. Wealth accumulation becomes immoral because it stems from exploitation, perpetuates inequality, and undermines collective well-being. Capitalist wealth is not a neutral measure of value creation; it represents the privatization of social resources and labor. Even if wealth contributes to philanthropy or economic growth, the structural harm it causesby commodifying human labor, concentrating power, and prioritizing profit over peopleoutweighs any perceived benefits.","title":"CMV: Billionaires Arent ImmoralTheir Wealth Reflects Value Creation at Scale"},{"text":"I second this.","title":"What is the libertarian views about feminism?"},{"text":"The Overton window in the US is skewed way to the right.","title":"Nancy Pelosi Actively Working to Tank AOCs Bid for Top Committee Role"},{"text":"If you truly believe in some kind of coherent Democratic platform, then you need to be able to answer major policy questions like where the energy for your civilization is going to come from and how people are going to afford a better lifestyle.

If we're talking first wave feminism where women fought for the right to vote, own property, and be recognized as having the same rights as men, libertarians agree with that.If we're talking about second wave feminism for equal employment opportunities and equal pay for equal work, libertarians generally support that as long as the equal pay is along the lines of removing gender discrimination. I.e., paying a woman less than a man because she is a woman, would be seen as negative by libertarians and opposed. If we're talking about third wave feminism, the kind that posits the concept of the patriarchy and believes in intersectionality. No, libertarians do not support this sort of feminism. Patriarchy is the idea that the whole of society is built around the concept of the dominance of men or sometimes the dominance of a few men to hold down and oppress women. This is obviously nonsense as this is just basically Marx's theory of the proletariat vs the bourgeois except its from the lens of women vs men in a dominate hierarchy. Women in the west are obviously not oppressed and have more rights and opportunities than women did at any other point in history. If someone advocates that women in the third world are oppressed, fair enough as there are places in Africa and the Middle East where women do live as second class citizens. Libertarians should oppose this and advocate for peaceful change.Intersectionality is a lens by which people can analyze the \\"intersections\\" of oppression based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or national origin. The idea posits that women are oppressed as compared to men and that blacks are oppressed as compared to whites so intersectionality would analyze how a black woman would experience multiple types of compounding oppression due to being both black and a woman. If you're wondering where the modern idea of DEI came from as well as identity politics/white privilege, you can thank intersectional feminism.Intersectionality should be condemned by libertarians by the virtue that it is a collectivist way to view the world and holds group identity over individuality. Libertarianism is an individualist philosophy that holds that judging someone by their immutable characteristics is both amoral and dangerous as collectivist thinking is behind all the horrors of the world like communism, fascism, religious extremism, and genocide.","title":"What is the libertarian views about feminism?"},{"text":"Queer.","title":"CMV: putting Luigi Mangione on a pedestal for murdering Brian Thompson is wrong and takes hatred and anger too far."},{"text":"Joe Biden doesn't have an inkling of dementia.

There were lots of massive massacres of villages by Jewish militias, you can't have researched very far if you only found the opposite. Everyone including Palestinians can and could have sympathy for Jews after the holocaust but why do the Palestinians have to exclusively pay for this when they had nothing to do with it?

Manchin's blue dog political perspective would likely have been very beneficial in the Dems' efforts to appeal to the working class, and the fact that he's a white male would've likely helped as well.

It would not surprise me if you're right, but let's go with the full devil's advocate view.The main problem is Biden is unpopular, so you need someone completely outside of the federal government, which means it's probably going to be a state governor. This is admittedly also a point against realism, but to create a best case scenario, lets say the democratic party gets behind Josh Shapiro. Considering the importance of Pennsylvania this seems like the most obvious choice, but the most important thing is it is someone who can realistically distance themselves from Biden and criticize his administration where necessary.Next, I think you need to look at the dynamics of the race. Harris opened up her best polling lead in late August, up to about a month after the debate, then lost all her steam in October. We need to fix that. Realistically, to get this scenario in the first place where Biden is distant, we probably need some sort of primary process, which would occur around the DNC. Ideally, what we need to fix is the debate timing. If Trump and his team are smart this can't happen, but I would push for a debate in mid October. I don't care if its on Fox news, I take it anyways. I have faith that literally anyone other than Biden will smoke Trump in a debate because he was truly awful in both debates. I have Josh Shapiro talk to anyone and everyone who will listen, and I have him gladly roast Biden where necessary to distance himself from Biden.Last, lets address the polls. You're pointing to a July poll that has Harris losing to Trump 43-49. The election was much, much closer than that. On top of that, Trump has poor favourable rankings, and has had them for years. Problem is, the current administration is also unpopular. Even so, were the election in September, if you believe the polls, Kamala probably wins if the election is a month earlier (https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/).

I also wanted to exclude absurd suggestions like, \\"The Dems could've run Mitt Romney.\\" I think the way I defined \\"realistic\\" was acceptable for the purpose of fostering productive discussion. I didn't address the argument about closeness implying another candidate could win because I addressed that argument in other comments. However, I'll just reiterate what I said before and tailor it to what you wrote. No, this election was not much closer than 2020. Due to the way the electoral college works, and the strategy Dems use to win, this election would best be considered a blowout. 2020 came down to about 43k votes across 3 states (AZ, GA and WI). If those votes had gone the other way, Trump would have won in 2020. That's despite Biden winning by about 7M votes. This demonstrates how hard it can be for Dems to move the needle on swing states, even when easily winning the popular vote. In 2016, Hillary easily won the popular vote (winning by about 3M). But still lost the election due to about 70,000 votes in swing states. Kamala needed about 230,000 votes in key swing states to win. She just doesn't get those votes without a massive popular vote swing. I think it's fair to say you'd expect that she'd need to win the popular vote by more than Hilary. And she didn't win the popular vote at all. You have to go back to 1988 to find a Democratic candidate who did worse in the electoral college. So no, it wasn't really close. It's not obvious that another Dem could outperform her to the degree necessary to win.","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"The wolves are getting hungry,?

You're speaking as if there would be a simple manner to target exactly those 230,000 voters or so without losing some voters. But I don't think that's likely. You gotta remember that the popular vote is typically the *easier* vote for Dems to win. It takes more mass appeal to translate to votes in the swing states. I think you'd agree that if Kamala won Wisconsin, you'd expect that to mean her popular vote total would likely increase by substantially more than the votes she won in Wisconsin. So how much more mass appeal would she need to win Wisconsin?Kamala lost by 30k votes in Wisconsin and lost the popular vote by 2.3M. in 2020, Biden was barely able to eke out a win in Wisconsin, winning by just 20,000, despite winning the popular vote by about 7 million. In other words, turning one Wisconsin voter requires the appeal to turn 186 voters throughout the nation.  Winning Wisconsin might require about 5.5M voter swing for Kamala.Now, I know you're thinking that more targeted policies and campaigning could get this win without the mass appeal.

The most effective manner of doing so is through targeted recounts requested by the candidate. In the light of the breaches we ask that you formally request hand recounts in at least the states of Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. We have no evidence that the outcomes of the elections in those states were actually compromised as a result of the security breaches, and we are not suggesting that they were. But binding risk-limiting audits (RLAs) or hand recounts should be routine for all elections, especially when the stakes are high and the results are close. We believe that, under the current circumstances when massive software breaches are known and documented, recounts are necessary and appropriate to remove all potential doubt and to set an example for security best practices in all elections.\\n \\n In 2022, records, video camera footage, and deposition testimony produced in a civil case in Georgia^1 disclosed that its voting system, used statewide, had been breached over multiple days by operatives hired by attorneys for Donald Trump.^2,3 The evidence showed that the operatives made copies of the software that runs all of the equipment in Georgia, and certain other states, and shared it with other Trump allies and operatives.^4\\n \\n Subsequent court filings and public records requests revealed that the breaches in Georgia were part of a larger effort to take copies of voting system software from systems in Michigan,^5 Pennsylvania,^6 Colorado^7 and Arizona,^8 and to share the software in the operatives network. According to testimony^9 and declarations^10 by some of the technicians who have obtained copies of the software, they have had access for more than three years to the software for the central servers, tabulators, and highly restricted election databases of both Election Systems &amp; Software (ES&amp;S), and Dominion Voting Systems, the two largest voting system vendors, constituting the most severe election security breach publicly known.\\n \\n Combined, their equipment counts nearly 70% of all votes nationwide. Ninety-six percent of Arizona voters use Dominion and ES&amp;S equipment; 100% of Georgia voters vote on Dominion machines; 98% of Nevada votes on Dominion voting machines and the remainder uses ES&amp;S; 69% of Michigan voters ballots are counted on Dominion or ES&amp;S equipment; 89% of Pennsylvania voters ballots are counted on Dominion or ES&amp;S equipment; ES&amp;S counts 92% of North Carolina ballots; and either ES&amp;S or Dominion counts 97% of Wisconsin votes.^11\\n \\n Possessing copies of the voting system software enables bad actors to install it on electronic devices and to create their own working replicas of the voting systems, probe them, and develop exploits. Skilled adversaries can decompile the software to get a version of the source code, study it for vulnerabilities, and could even develop malware designed to be installed with minimal physical access to the voting equipment by unskilled accomplices to manipulate the vote counts. Attacks could also be launched by compromising the vendors responsible for programming systems before elections, enabling large scale distribution of malware.\\n \\n In December 2022^12 and again in 2023,^13 many of us, concerned by the security risks posed by these breaches, wrote to the Attorney General, FBI Director, and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Director outlining the security concerns and urging an investigation. Though there have been limited, localized investigations,^14 there is no evidence of a federal investigation^15 to determine what was done with the misappropriated voting software.\\n \\n Other relevant parties have pointed to the serious risks posed by the misappropriation of the voting software. Before it was known that partisan operatives had taken the software, Dominion Voting Systems objected vehemently to providing its software to the same partisan actors who ultimately got copies through voting system breaches, stating that to give its software to biased actors would cause irreparable damage to the election security interests of the country.^16\\n \\n Before the breaches in Georgia had been confirmed, the Georgia Secretary of States chief information officer testified that having copies of the software would provide a road map to the ways the system could be accessed.^17 The Georgia Attorney General opposed providing copies of the software to lawyers for the Trump campaign in a late 2020 election challenge, arguing that images of the voting system software would provide the keys to the software kingdom.^18\\n \\n Notably, U.S. elections are potentially resilient because there are paper ballots recording the voters intent in most states, meaning that even if the voting system is at risk, the will of the voters can be determined reliably by recounting the paper ballots by hand (although we are aware that not all paper ballots are verified by the voter, and not all states take adequate care to protect the ballot chain of custody.)\\n \\n Audits will be conducted in some of the most scrutinized states, but in key states they will not be conducted in a timely way that could reveal any concerns with the vote count. In addition, in most states the audits are insufficiently rigorous to ensure any potential errors in tabulation will be caught and corrected, and they cannot be considered a safeguard against the security breaches that have occurred. Specifically, Georgias audits are non-binding, and Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin laws do not provide that the audit be conducted before certification. Therefore, it would be impossible to know for these critical states if the audits uncovered errors or miscalculations before the state deadlines to seek recounts.^19\\n \\n Among swing states, only Arizonas audit laws ensure that, if enough discrepancies are identified, the audit hand count will be expanded to correct a potentially incorrect result. In other words, aside from Arizona, in contested states, there is no legal mechanism for the audit to correct the outcome, no matter how much error the audit uncovers. Given these facts, the only guarantee for rigorous, effective audits of the vote in the swing states will be through candidate-requested statewide hand recounts.\\n The facts around the voting system breaches are not disputed; it is well-documented that there were severe, multiple voting security breaches before the 2024 election. To ensure that voters can have confidence that the breaches in security did not taint the results of the 2024 election, we recommend pursuing hand recounts in, at minimum, Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania as they will provide insufficient safeguards against threats posed by the breaches of the election software and will not provide important information in a timely way.\\n","title":"The end of House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries' press conference"},{"text":"I agree with OP but in regards to this link:\\nhttps://law4palestine.org/law-for-palestine-releases-database-with-500-instances-of-israeli-incitement-to-genocide-continuously-updated/\\nGenerally when two countries at war, anything coming directly from either side is very likely to be heavily biased.

Not a good person or good leader or anything, but he's very successful as a candidate. It's not as if downballot Dems were really offering much different from Kamala. It's just that they weren't against Trump.That all said, I think the problem was less the candidate and more the lack of a sustained, emotionally salient vision party wide. There were policies in mind, wonky bits and pieces here and there, but there wasnt a clearly articulated future. It was about preserving what we had and fear-mongering about Project 2025 and the state of democracy. Trumps campaign offered a clear (but vindictive) vision of the future, whereas the Kamala campaign didnt. Beyond that, my challenge to your view is less that a Democratic loss was inevitable due to the candidate, but because the party itself lacks messaging cohesion and morale. It can raise a ton of money, thats a strength (ostensibly), but it cant build a sustained campaign out of it (think funding year-round podcasters, content creators, &amp;c.)  and campaigning isnt a sprint, its a marathon.So this goes beyond the scope of this CMV, but I'll address what you're saying here. It's clear that the Democrats tried to make the Biden presidency and the 2024 election about a return to general normalcy, and a decrease in destructive partisanship. They followed a \\"big tent\\" strategy, courting \\"sensible Republicans,\\" and part of that strategy required doing little to rock the boat. This strategy didn't work at all. 96% of Republicans voted Trump, same as 2020, and 3 points higher than 2016. So it's clear that this strategy doesn't really pay electoral dividends in the way they hoped. My concern is that any real cohesive message about a Democratic future will inevitably push some people out of the big tent. There are plenty of moderate Dems out there that might be dissuaded from voting blue if the Dems go too progressive. If they go in a more populist direction (for example, by focusing on deporting illegal immigrants) then they'll lose some on the left side of the tent, similar to how they lost some of those voters due to the position on Gaza.Ultimately, I think you're right that they need some stronger message. But unlike Republicans, who tend to \\"fall in line,\\" left-leaning voters are finicky. The message about the future must be very well tailored.","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"Dont forget the billionaire family and son of the president.

There were policies in mind, wonky bits and pieces here and there, but there wasnt a clearly articulated _future_. It was about preserving what we had and fear-mongering about Project 2025 and the state of democracy. Trumps campaign offered a clear (but vindictive) vision of the future, whereas the Kamala campaign didnt.Beyond that, my challenge to your view is less that a Democratic loss was inevitable due to the candidate, but because the party itself lacks messaging cohesion and morale. It can raise a ton of money, thats a strength (ostensibly), but it cant build a sustained campaign out of it (think funding year-round podcasters, content creators, &amp;c.)  and campaigning isnt a sprint, its a marathon.","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"I stopped watching the news altogether and would venture to guess this will not be widely reported anyway.","title":"Key Witness Reveals He Lied About Biden Corruption | Alexander Smirnov admitted he fabricated the conspiracy that Joe Biden and his son Hunter had made millions from a Ukrainian energy company."},{"text":"didn't he try to start a war with Iran on his way out the door last time?","title":"Joe Biden under pressure to take away Donald Trump's nuclear war power"},{"text":"Sure, a contested primary in July.

While primaries are often the best way to pick the best candidate, they often result in beating up the eventual winner before the race. Hilary and Biden, for example, came out of their primaries with far more baggage than they entered the primary with. Imagine if Dems recognized early on that Biden should be a one term president due to his age, and decided to run a primary. Bernie, Kamala, and let's say Newsom run. Kamala and Newsom would attack Bernie for being old (the reason Biden dropped out), Sanders and Newsom would attack Kamala for inflation under \\"her\\" administration, and Bernie and Kamala would attack Newsom for his smug fucking face. No matter who won, they'd all come out of the race a bit weaker.I'm not supportive of the way Dems decided not to run a primary. Biden and those around him should have been more forthright about how his age was affecting him, and he should have been willing to step down and allowed a primary to pick his successor. But even though I think what occurred was ultimately undemocratic, I think it was probably the best course of action for beating Trump, even though it didn't succeed..","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"Agree","title":"Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Tim Walz joins Bluesky"},{"text":"Yeah, it's just been getting worse (by design) is all.

Primarily a consequence of the 1948 ArabCIsraeli War, the mass movement mainly transpired from 1948 to the early 1970s, with one final exodus of Iranian Jews occurring shortly after the Islamic Revolution in 1979C1980. An estimated 650,000 (72%) of these Jews resettled in Israel.In 1948, approximately 75,000 Jews lived in Egypt. About 100 remain today, mostly in Cairo. In 1948, Jewish neighborhoods in Cairo suffered bomb attacks that killed at least 70 Jews. Hundreds of Jews were arrested and had their property confiscated. After the 1956 Suez Crisis, Egypt expelled over 25,000 Jews, confiscated their property, and about 3,000 were imprisoned. About 1,000 more were imprisoned or detained. In 1967, Jews were detained and tortured, and Jewish homes were confiscated as emigration continued. Egypt was once home of one of the most dynamic Jewish communities in their diaspora. Caliphs in the ninth-eleventh centuries CE exercised various repressive policies, culminating in the destruction and mass murder of the Jewish quarter in Cairo in 1012. Conditions varied between then and the advent of the Ottoman Empire in 1517, when they deteriorated again. There were at least six blood libel persecutions in cities between 1870 and 1892.Upon independence in 1962 only Muslims were permitted Algerian citizenship, and 95% of Algeria's 140,000 Jewish population left. Since 1870 (briefly revoked by Vichy France in 1940), most Jews in Algeria had French citizenship, and they mainly went to France, with some going to Israel.By 1969, fewer than 1,000 Jews were still living in Algeria. By 1975 the government had seized all but one of the country's synagogues and converted them to mosques or libraries.\\nMorocco Jewish population 1948: 265,000Morocco Jewish population 20172,000Libya 1948:38,000Libya 20190Tunisia 1948150,000Tunisia 20171,700Yemen 194863,000Yemen 201750Iran 1948 150,000Iran 201710Syria 194838,000Syria 2017100Iraq 1948100,000Iraq 20169,800\\n 1016: Jews are persecuted and driven out of Kairouan? 1010: persecution of Christians, Jews and Sunnis by the Fatimid caliph Al Hakim? 1032: 5 to 6,000 Jews killed in a riot in Fez and expulsion of survivors? 1040: beheading of the Jewish theologian Gaon Chizkiya, head of a Talmudic school? 1106: Ali Ibn Yousef Ibn Tashifin of Marrakech decrees the death penalty for any local Jew, including his Jewish doctor, and his military general.? 1148: the Almohads of Morocco give Jews the choice of converting to Islam or being expelled? 1057: capture and pillage of Kairouan by the Hilalian tribes; expulsion of Jews and certain Muslims? 1066: Massacre of thousands of Jews in Granada in Muslim-occupied Spain? 1073: start of persecution against Jews and Christians by the Turks in Jerusalem? 1127: in Morocco, after the failure of the prophetic movement of the Jewish messiah Moshe Dhery, wave of persecutions and forced conversions? 1142: start of persecution against the Jews by the Almohads; massacre in Tlemcen, Bougie, Oran? 1145: the Jews of Tunis must choose between conversion and exile? 1146: capture of Meknes by the Almohads; persecution of the Jews? 1147: capture of Tlemcen by the Almohads; persecution of the Jews? 1147: Almohad invasion of Spain: expulsion of Jews or forced conversions? 1147: capture of Marrakech by the Almohads; persecution of the Jews? 1147: start of Almohad persecutions against the Jews of North Africa? 1148: start of the exodus of Maimonides fleeing the intolerance of the Almohads? 1148: Almohadin of Morocco gives Jews the choice of converting to Islam or being expelled.? 1152: advent of Abd el Moumin in Morocco; choice for Christians and Jews between conversion or death? 1159: controversy between Maimonides and the rabbi of Fez on the attitude towards forcible converts? 1160: capture of Ifriqiya by the Moroccans of Abd el Moumen; Jews and Christians must choose between death and conversion; Jews are converted by force and superficially.? 1165C1178: Yemen: Jews throughout the country were given the choice (under the new constitution) to convert to Islam or die","title":"cmv: the unity of the Palestinian movement, especially regarding Oct 7, is to its detriment and the detriment of Palestinian lives"},{"text":"Not a single war criminal amongst them.","title":"Biden commutes roughly 1,500 sentences and pardons 39 people in biggest single-day act of clemency"},{"text":"Hope so.

It was four months after the eruption of hostilities between Jews and Arabs in Palestine, and about a month before the termination of the British mandate and the establishment of the State of Israel. Deir Yassin was not the peaceful village many later claimed it to be, but a fortified village with scores of armed combatants. Its relations with the adjacent Jewish neighborhoods were troubled for decades and the Jews believed it to endanger the only road from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv, thus constituting part of the Arab siege of Jewish Jerusalem. Therefore, although later denying it for political reasons, the Jewish main militia in 1948, the Haganah, sanctioned the attack and later took part in it by means of its striking force, the Palmach.A ten-hour fierce battle, in the presence of a civilian population, ended in the victory of Etzel and Lehi. No massacre took place. When the battle ended, the killing stopped. I believe that most of those who were killed were among the fighters and the women and children who helped the fighters, one of the Arab survivors was later to testify. Furthermore, the Arab villagers got an advance warning to evacuate the village, which 700 of them followed. The attackers took an additional 200 villagers prisoner and safely released them in Arab Jerusalem. Only 101 Arabs were killed, a quarter of them active combatants and most of the rest in combat conditions. The Jewish assailants also suffered casualties.For psychological warfare considerations, Etzel reported 200 Arabs killed, twice more than the actual number, enthusiastically adopted by the Palestinian leadership in Jerusalem, which increased it to 254 and added rapes and other gender-oriented atrocities. Hussein Khalidi, the senior Arab authority in 1948 Jerusalem, was of the opinion that, We must make the most of this. As his assistant Hazim Nusayba reported in a 1998 interview, Khalidi said we should give this the utmost propaganda possible because the Arab countries apparently are not interested in assisting us and we are facing a catastrophe.So we are forced to give a picture C not what is actually happening C but we had to exaggerate. Khalidis distortion of the facts failed to prevent catastrophe. Instead, it helped created one.Mohammed Radwan, one of the villagers who fought the attackers, said: \\"There were no rapes. It's all lies. There were no pregnant women who were slit open. It was propaganda that Arabs put out so Arab armies would invade. They ended up expelling people from all of Palestine on the rumor of Deir Yassin.\\"Radwan added \\"I know when I speak that God is up there and God knows the truth and God will not forgive the liars.\\"There are people alive today who have talked about their experiences all of which entail being told to by their own government to leave and not return until \\"the destruction of yahoud (the Jews). This is documented, there were no \\"forced gunpoint\\" takeovers only a failed attempt of genocide against the Jewish population by Arab forces who blocked the only source of water, destroyed pipelines and marched into battle with swastikas painted on tanksThey were so sure of victory they described with glee what they thought the outcome of their attacks would be comparing it to the \\"mongol massacres\\" and \\"second kybar\\" after the first kybar which entailed the genocide of the Jewish population in the region much like the attempts of genocide against the Maronite Christians in Lebanon by Syria and Palestinians or the attempted takeover of Jordan again by the Palestinians, or the attempted takeover of Egypt by the Palestinians or the attempted takeover of Iraq by the Palestinians. If you'd like to know more about the history of nakba from the son of one of the two Hamas founder's this is a good start. He talks about how his grandmother was told to leave by the Palestinian forces not Israeli. She refused and still lives on the land the same as other Palestinians who are now the majority of the 2.5 million Muslim Arab population in Israel.https://youtu.be/necPCKnfMd4?si=46LhFodizvjNNPQO","title":"cmv: the unity of the Palestinian movement, especially regarding Oct 7, is to its detriment and the detriment of Palestinian lives"},{"text":"Technically it started in the 70s with Nixons dumb ass. Then came Ronald Regan in the 80s. His war on drugs was an epic failure &amp; was used to feed profit prison with the black &amp; hispanic communities. Ronald Regan also allowed Henry Kissinger to create a global economy based on winners &amp; losers. The leaders of the Middle East were lied to when they found out their countries were indeed chosen to always benefit the least from this global economic system. This led to the instability in the Middle East that weve seen for decades. Theres honestly so many problems Ronald Reagan caused this comment would never end. Clinton did move labor overseas &amp; it decimated communities. All the high paying jobs are now found in cities. If you are confused why the Midwest or people in the South can believe in someone like Trump its because democrats took their livelihood away and they became hopeless. When you have no hope and nothing ever changes you will believe in anything as long as that person promises hope. Trump doesnt do shit for the poor but fuck them over, but hes also the only one who pretends to give a shit. Who should they vote for? Democrats telling them they are stupid &amp; racist?

I participated in the Pfizer Covid vaccine study in fall of 2020. I am pro vaccine, I believe in the science and so when this pandemic hit, I wanted to do my part to help in someway. I talked my fiance at the time into joining me which I wholeheartedly regret. Three months later, he was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism that had a 30% chance of killing him. Doctors thought he had contracted covid but he was negative with positive antibodies (assuming they came from the vaccine). We tried to report the incident to Pfizer but after leaving three unreturned voice messages to the head person running the study, we gave up. We ended up contracting COVID a month later so that ruled out that possibility. We were told the dose we received was the same dose that was given to the public later in 2021. When sharing my experience, I was called all types of names: anti-vaccer, crazy republican, etc. All i wanted to communicate is that maybe we shouldnt have rushed mandated this vaccine on such a mass scale, we shouldnt have threatened peoples jobs and livelihood if they refused something that may have put their lives in jeopardy.

Multiple cases involved patients who were still so sick they needed daily infusions to treat infections.-Its still happening, one employee complained in internal communications obtained by STAT. Another added: I had one that I had to communicate two times that was an IV and very clear on the continued stay  and it was still [denied].-The tensions emerged after NaviHealth was acquired by Optum, a division of UnitedHealth Group, which also owns the nations largest Medicare Advantage insurer, according to three former NaviHealth employees. Attempts to extend care past a predicted discharge date, or authorize treatment in a more expensive facility, resulted in pushback from managers. If employees did it repeatedly, managers questioned whether they needed to be retrained.-It was very much about following the algorithms and basically not using your clinical judgment, one former NaviHealth medical reviewer said. That was very different from before we were owned by Optum.-In some cases, the algorithm was used in coverage decisions that may violate Medicares rules, which are designed to protect the safety and dignity of beneficiaries. The investigation revealed that even in instances when staffers argued that patients needed more time in rehab, NaviHealths physician medical reviewers deferred to the algorithm, fueling internal dissent that the denials were inappropriate and contrary to clear medical evidence.","title":"62% of Americans demand government-ensured healthcare as trust in for-profit system hits historic low | New Gallup poll shows record-high support for universal healthcare, with bipartisan frustration mounting over rising costs and systemic inequities."},{"text":"I can see why there might be a perception of what you said, but is it statistically supported?

(Which is so commonplace on this platform Ive come to think of it as Reddit Syndrome.)My argument was far narrower than you took it for. I merely pointed out that **killing healthcare executives doesnt solve the problem.** I mean, does it? There are literally a dozen people at UHC to replace any given Brian Thompson. The corporation has the population of a major metropolitan area. But Ill play along and broaden the gauge: instead of rejecting *executive murder* per se on the grounds that its not an effective tool for reforming American healthcare, Ill embrace the position I did not take but you presumed I had, and argue that *violence itself* is not an effective means to get what  presumably? we really want: affordable healthcare for all Americans.Im not rejecting violence because violence is wrong. Personally, I dont think it is. There are times when use of violence is not only morally defensible, I think it is morally *obligatory*.My problem with violence in this context is that, as a means of bringing about social change, it is extremely *inefficient*. And like you, Ill draw on history to make that point.Attend: the executive class has already drawn the wrong lesson from the Thompson murder. Theyre not reviewing their treatment approval policies; theyre making inquiries to corporate security firms. Its not, They killed Brian! Lets review our billing policies!; its They killed Brian!  Body armor for all C-executives and board members, and from now on all our public appearances will be virtual!They are not going to draw the right lessons from what has happened, and their fear is not going to create a direct line to what *I* want: Medicare For All. I mean, OK, theyre afraid: good. But wouldnt you agree with me that elite fear *per se* is not the goal? In the best of all possible worlds, if elite fear leads to me getting affordable treatment for my MS, Im all for it  but its the latter I actually care about. If I have what I need, what my family needs, I dont give a fuck about the elites. Elite fear is, optimally, just a means to an end.I have some expertise in Latin American history. Our elites in America are just as stupid as the elites in the southern cone countries  and those societies lived through decades of Dirty Wars. The ambient revolutionary violence implemented by reformers in the 70s and 80s didnt lead to better conditions for the working classes  it just lead to protracted violence. Terrorism lead to police state violence. Both sides lost their humanity and did terrible, monstrous things to each other  for *decades*, paisan, for decades, and the violence became entrenched  just as Thompsons murder is not leading to UHC lowering prices, its leading to C-teams deciding that executives bulletproofing their cars can be claimed on corporate expense accounts.**The elite are too stupid and morally benighted to learn the right lessons from targeted violence.**The escalating Dirty Wars in Latin America were a collective exercise in *fucking stupidity*. A lot of normal, working class families were destroyed by state violence. Ultimately, reformers didnt get reform because the plutocratic corporate fascists saw the light. They got reform after literal decades of violence because both sides were simply exhausted by the unending horror. No one wanted to live like that anymore. I dont want that for the American working class  do you? I dont want that for the people I love. So: Im not rejecting what Mangione did because it was violent and deadly; Im rejecting it because its simply *ineffective*. Now, if Thompsons murder leads to a massive political uprising that leads to healthcare reform, Ill rescind my criticism. Ill be fucking glad to be wrong. I just doubt Im wrong. So. Im pointing out, respectfully, that you got all wound up making an articulate violence isnt always wrong argument, but youre preaching to the choir. Im not against violence *qua* violence; Im against violence when its stupid and wont lead to the goal. What will? UHC has ~52 million customers. What if 10 million signed a petition demanding reform, and collectively pledged to boycott paying their UHC bills if the company doesnt reform? By signing a petition, no one is put at immediate risk  but they all see that, hey, holy fuck, there are *millions of people as pissed off as I am*! One person refuses to pay, UHC destroys them. *Ten million people* refuse to pay, that destroys UHC. Youd see some fucking reform then. UHCs C-team would be shitting themselves  and they wouldnt be the only ones. (Aphorism from the world of banking: If you owe the bank a million dollars, the bank owns you; if you owe the bank *fifty* million dollars, you own the bank.)They can replace an executive or even a dozen. They cannot replace 10 million revenue streams. This idea is imperfect, but you get the concept. It would be way more fucking effective. And thats the point. If killing executives solved the problem, hey, kill em all. But I think financially starving the beast is way more effective.","title":"Bernie Sanders: A Mass Movement can beat Health CEO Greed - Jacobin Magazine"},{"text":" LOL... downvoters...You get an upvote from me and a present:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbXZoMocpM8","title":"Elon Musk calls Trudeau an insufferable tool for comments on Kamala Harris's defeat"},{"text":"worry more about the things that ARE true - because they are the ones doing it.   \\nI'd be hard pressed to think of something a democrat is accused of doing that a republican wasn't caught doing.

Yes, angels and demons I believe are these interdimensional beings and they have a hierarchy and that is where I don't know how the hierarchy works and it would be speculating of me, again angels and demons are just language we use to describe the opposing forces influencing us and taking place. The bad forces could disguise themselves as pretty shiny things to get out attention and have us grounded to the energy this world vibrates at, not letting us find our full potential and break through the matrix through Jesus, a true mercenary and the ultimate conspiracy theorist, he was the most divine, and yeah, I know you will probably get upset I am bringing Jesus in it. I understand, religion has been manipulated by the very devil himself, if we get past that and focus on the spiritual part of it, I think everything in the world going on would make more sense along with our origins and our purpose, I agree we aren't experts and I could be wrong, not trying to preach at all , I got into all of this when my dad told me what the illuminati was in 4th grade.","title":"Aliens ??"},{"text":"My favorite is how everyone who finds out you voted for Trump likes to say we have \\"no idea\\" what we voted for and that most people are \\"low information voters.

They allowed giant monopolies to exist in almost every financial sector. This is why we see the cost of food continue to soar. Bernie Sanders was 100% correct the democrats are not for the working class. Ask Nacy Pelosi how shes so good at the stock market. Ive voted democrat my entire life. Obama was the first president I was able to vote for. Democrats have morphed into the party for the wealthy. They spend most of their time arguing about gender bs &amp; issues that dont really help anyone. The point of being a liberal is wanting whats best for all people. Not everyone is going to like you. I supported the lgbt community when they wanted equal rights because our government can legislate equal rights for all. If someone calls you something you dont like well thats life. That will always exist. Most far left people have lost their minds. Trying to legislate what people can or can not say. Theyve turned into puritans pointing the finger at anyone that doesnt 100% agree with their word view. This has caused the left to fight issues that dont actually fix the root of our problems. The wealthy class has waged war on poor people since the 70s. Our politicians have been bought since the 70s. We need to hold corporations accountable. We need to put CEOs in prison for poising Americans food and air supply. We need better education. Eliminating private schools would be a great start. Our justice system clearly doesnt apply to the ultra wealthy. There is so many easy conventional ways to solve most of our problems but it interferes with the wealthy classs plan to funnel all money towards the top. Hurt people hurt people. There is an ugly feedback loop happening with the poor class. For too long theyve promised change and delivered nothing but ways to screw over the average American. Red or blue nothing ever changes. The rich get richer and the poor get infinitely dumber.

So I was paying attention to all the bullshit since I had no job.  Well Dems was always trying to get more handouts, which anyone with a brain could see injecting trillions would cause inflation.  I was always against every single hand out.  Every handout the Dems wanted to give more trillions than what was actually given.  Dems even wanted a 4th handout.  The more money you dilute the money supply with, the worse inflation gets.  Dems knew what they were doing here.Then they were also wanting to keep the economy shut down the whole time.  The Michigan governor whitmer, or whatever her name is, keep calling for keeping the economy/business shut down.  But as soon as Biden won the election, she did a 180 and was saying we must open back up.  Wonder what made her change her mind.  She wasn't the only Dem to do this, but the main name I remembered.    This is just so fucked up.

Most mainstream economists accept the basic theoretical insight that there exists some tax rate beyond which tax revenues would decrease due to reduced economic activity or increased avoidance. However, the strong supply-side claims associated with it are generally not considered mainstream.The empirical consensus among economists is that the revenue-maximizing tax rate is likely much higher than current rates in most developed economies. For instance, Diamond and Saez (2011) estimated the revenue-maximizing rate for high earners to be around 73%, while current top marginal rates in the US are much lower.The core debate isnt really about whether the Laffer Curve exists (most economists agree it must), but rather:\\n1. Where the revenue-maximizing point actually lies\\n2. How responsive taxpayers are to rate changes (the elasticity of taxable income)\\n3.

It is merely a byproduct of a society that incentives people to only think about themselves and how they can contribute to the private market. It can mean different things to different people.We all perceive it in our own unique ways. And so, comes the crux of my argument. We have simply become too selfish with respect to our own feelings, desires, and career prospects, most of which are increasing being displaced anyways by AI in the private market. We can altogether transcend this selfish feeling altogether and make it a non-issue by restructuring society in a way where people prioritize helping other people, rather than focusing on themselves and their careers, especially in the private sector. When we all learn to focus on helping others and their feelings instead of our own, then our collective loneliness will naturally go away. The problem with this is there there are series of actions that society can take that create structural ambivalence that disenfranchise people. A lot of people that aren't nessecerily selfish, or self interested can still create a selfish outcome even if they are not inherently acting selfishly.A big example for me, that I have given this very line of thought to is Dungeons and Dragons. I have been a player for 18 years at this point and 5th edition has so grossly changed the landscape of the game into something I don't recognize or even enjoy anymore. The mechanics have become stupidly simplified from 3.5, the community has lost a lot of it's critical thought on the whole in favor of DM fiat and just good vibes and any time I levy a complaint someone will inevitably come in and say \\"Just play a different system.\\" \\"Just hombrew this way.\\" both statements completely missing the point of my problem. It's so fucked that anyone is allowed to feel alienated from the franchises or systems they pioneered and help built only to later be traded in service to corporate interests for an uptick in casual fans. But I don't fault the individuals for this. It's not selfish of them to want to play their game either. But the problem is players like me are just completely screwed. It's like being a second class citizen in a hobby that used to bring immense joy. The overall fracturing of player bases into hyper niche communities has made D&amp;D a soft monopoly to boot. The point is that, if everyone were in fact less selfish, it doesn't actually solve the problems you're setting out to solve. Everyone acting less selfish would ultimately invert on itself, and lead to a similar state of loss because instead of being self interested and laying claim to a stake in the world we live in, you're asking everyone to give that up and to be satisfied with less, when some people already feel like they have nothing.","title":"CMV: The collective loneliness we feel right now can be transcended by restructuring society to become less selfish."},{"text":"Sinema was cut off by the party.

They're not discovering $5Billion data centers in shale while Norway's extracting trillion dollar oil reserves that have been sitting there for millions of years just waiting for them...So when Norway eventually does run out of oil, they won't be able to just double their taxes and like magic, it's business as usual. More than likely, they'll end up with austerity measures to protect themselves.

On a certain level, this is true. A campaign cant focus on every precinct equally or every state or region equally in a national election. And the truth is that while some pet issues are important to the electorate, we cant run on everything that everyone.But I think that you did a great job of highlighting the fact that feminism and uplifting women is not a pet issue or an issue that should be focused away from. It is an essential pillar of our partys success and a noble cause. Dealing with womens issues and fighting the patriarchy is a net positive to society and it wins elections. Empowered women empower our society.Maybe people cared more about gas prices than reproductive rights or not electing someone found civilly liable for rape, but we cant just change our policies and messaging to whatever worked for our opponents last time, it doesnt work. Swing voters and conservatives wont believe us and essential members of our base would abandon us.Im sure that the OP knows this, but I want any other denizens of this thread to imagine it this way. Imagine if in 2010, a year that was a smashing success for Republicans, they just co-opted Obamas platform or large parts of it and ran on that instead of what they did historically. That wouldve been a bloodbath for them because Obamas platform was meant to appeal to Democrats. Both parties have different bases and will continue to have different bases, and abandoning commitments to equality is not only morally wrong  it will be an electoral loser.We can talk about changing our messaging or some of our policies, but marginalized people around the country are counting on us. When we talk about shifting a position or emphasizing something else lets avoid putting a marginalized group on the chopping block.

Suicides and rates of depression, especially in our adult youth, are very disheartening to learn about. You talk about combating these inherently selfish feeling with fire basically through even more selfish endeavors, whether for malicious reasons or not. But, as human beings, we inherently just want more and more for ourselves. Our desires can never truly be satisfied.This is why I make the case that the issue of general societal loneliness is best approached through transcending it via moving more towards paid volunteer based society, rather than tackling it head on as it will never truly be extinguished or satiated; because that just incentivizes people to act towards their self-interest to unhealthy degrees. The best way is to get people to follow the ways of the compassionate Lord Christ, and to put the feelings and desires of other people first.

Going from ideas to action.  And it should be clear that our larger goal - electing Democrats - goes hand in hand with lessening bias against women in politics.  We've decided to stand with marginalized people, and we shouldn't let November's results scare us away from that.  But it means we've also got to confront sexism, and defend our values more explicitly.  And when I say 'we', I'm not talking about any elected Dems (though they should as well).  I'm talking about you and me.Reading this series will give you a good overview of the barriers women face in politics, and in general, and we've also discussed some general solutions.  Now let's get specific.**Keep learning**The ideas I put forth in this series aren't revolutionary - they're 101-level feminist concepts applied to politics.  And while knowledge isn't a substitute for action, it never hurts to learn more.  You'll also be better-equipped to talk about this stuff with others.If you like reading, [Everyday Feminism](https://everydayfeminism.com/) has some great articles, and they go into more detail about related issues like racism and anti-LGBT sentiment.  There are many excellent books as well - I rather like *Everyday Sexism* by Laura Bates and *Here We Are*, edited by Kelly Jensen.  If you're more into podcasts, [Stuff Mom Never Told You](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/stuff-mom-never-told-you/id304531053) has some good episodes, particularly their older ones (I don't know the new hosts as well), and the [Sixteenth Minute of Fame](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/were-talking-about-the-manosphere-the-wrong-way/id1743960803?i=10006798416890) podcast just started a series on the Manosphere, and the first episode was excellent.  I don't really do Youtubers, but I've heard good things about [Feminist Frequency](https://www.youtube.com/@feministfrequency/featured), which breaks down gender and sexism in pop culture.  If you have any other favorites, drop them below!But the best thing you can do is **listen when women talk about the shit they face.** Don't be so quick to write it off as coincidence or circumstances.  You can learn a surprising amount just by listening with an open mind.  You'll also be showing that you're a safe person to listen to.**Find like-minded people**Two reasons here.  First, you can teach each other a lot.  Second, once you see how much sexism poisons everything, you'll find the denials more aggravating than ever.  There's a reason I don't bother reading the comments on popular Reddit posts anymore.In keeping with the themes we've talked about, offline relationships are great for this, but online works well also.  If you're serious about doing something about this issue, you're going to need support.  I certainly didn't do this series alone; Mrs. Fireplace proofread every one of these posts, and your insights and awesome questions kept it going.  Just like in elections, it's never a one-person show.**Bring these ideas into your political activism**You knew this one was coming.  I'm not suggesting for a second that you give up on winning elections, because clearly we need that more than ever.But I'm sure you've seen that Democrats are scared right now.  We're getting a disappointing number of people who want to downplay or drop our commitment to equality so we don't lose.  Sometimes you have to read the tells, like when we're called on to 'ditch identity politics' or 'focus on economic issues and nothing else', while some have come right out and said we should ditch our allies.I want to win elections more than ever.  And I don't think giving up on our commitment to a fair world for everyone is the way to do that.  Instead, let's double down on inviting everyone into power and not letting the GOP strip our rights away.  We can do that and talk grocery prices.  But that fight for a better world only happens if we, the activists who get things done, demand it from the leadership.Though honestly, I don't think you'll be the only one talking about this.  The pundits have one opinion, but the mostly-female activists and volunteers in the party have pretty strong feelings of their own.  They'll probably be glad to have an ally!**Be ready when there's backlash**The anti-woman folks are feeling pretty bold right now.  They're going to say horrible shit.  When they do, make the decision whether to block, report, or call it out - whether it's online or in-person.  But don't be a bystander.  If it's someone you know, a simple \\"Hey, what do you mean by that?\\" or \\"Come on, man, that's not cool\\" can do the trick.  Especially if you're a guy.  You have a strange, mysterious power that makes guys like this take you more seriously than women.  It's a deep mystery.And Republicans are going to do the same thing, and back it up with proposed laws.  Time to dust off the old [Indivisible Guide](https://indivisible.org/resource/guide), now updated for 2024 and beyond.  Call their offices, protest, raise hell in person and online, and above all volunteer and vote so we get rid of them at the first opportunity.  The fight against Republicans and the fight for women's rights are going to be pretty closely linked for the next while.**Above all: It's not all on you**The manosphere is a big problem.  *It's not your job to fix it yourself.*The GOP is a big problem.  *It's not your job to fix it yourself.*Patriarchy is as old as society and ingrained in all of us.  *It's not your job to fix it yourself.*But you've got a friend who's on the fence and starting to give Joe Rogan a listen.  Or a City Council member or State Rep who supports these larger forces, and is trying to pass laws to advance them.  Or you're taking those first steps yourself out of implicit sexism.  Or you've known this stuff for a while, and need a nudge to keep sharing it against the backlash.The point is: **None of us can fix this ourselves, but we can all do something.**Way back when this sub was BlueMidterm2018, someone shared a video they made to promote voting.  I'm going to re-share it here, because it tells a story that's one of the guiding ideas for my own activism.  And, bonus, it explains what my weird title means.[Watch it here, and think about what it means for you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnY9VTASNLU)We can stand up for women in politics - and win.We can reject sexism - and win.We can build a better country and world - for everyone.And none of us have to do it all.  We've got starfish we can toss, and we can clear this beach together if we work together.Now is the time to be smart, and brave.  We know progress can win - it has for so long.  But every step women took was resisted furiously.  Every win came because a lot of people had the courage to keep going, and lots of individual victories added up to legal and political ones.  And that's the lesson we have to re-learn in this moment.As Kamala Harris promised, we're not going back.  I'm committed to defeating Republicans, without throwing women to the sideline in the process.  If we all do that, we *will* win again.  And we'll create a world where \\"Madam President\\" is a reality.  And where every woman from Madam President on down enjoys more and more freedom from sexist bias.Let's dream big and make it happen, together.**Questions to consider*Note:** Tomorrow, I'm going to make a short post asking for general feedback on this series.  If you have general thoughts, please share them then, so we don't miss out on discussing the ideas from this post.  Thanks!1. I suggested a few sources that are good for learning more about feminist ideas.  What are some other sources you like - videos, books, podcasts, etc?2. Which of these action points resonated with you the most?3. Do you think being an ally to women and a Democratic activist necessarily go together?  Why or why not?4.

The worst example is the neoliberal instinct to make any good program means-tested. Instead of making college free or very cheap, we have a bunch of various ways to get financial aid and scholarships and a cottage industry connected to navigating and administering those processes.  There is a reason everyone loves public libraries.  They simply serve everyone; so everyone has skin in the game to keep the quality higher.Democrats should focus on a few important areas of people's lives and commit to freeing people from the hassles and indignities that people face.  Examples: 1) Income tax filing should be automatic unless someone opts out; 2) Medicare for All or a Public Option should be top of our wish list so people don't have to fight with private insurers during their most vulnerable times; and 3) Medicare funded homecare so people don't have to become indigent and enter an nursing home. (Note: this was the best and most positive idea of the Harris campaign, but it came out too late and didn't get much attention.) Take those concepts and boil them down into easy to understand slogans and hit everyone over the head with them for the next 2-4 years.Finally, next session, the first thing Democrats should come out of the gate with is a bill to prevent lawmakers and their spouses from investing in individual stocks.

That's a strawman.Now, I'm not an assistant professor writing for *The Atlantic,* but I have opinions too, and here's one of them.If Dems want to win back working class voters, they need to fight for the working class, all of them - not just student loan borrowers, or UAW members, or Dreamers, or teachers, or former space shuttle pilots, ALL of them.As Trump fills his cabinet with wealthy donors, and gears up to wreck our economy with Smoot-Hawley 2.0, Democrats need to fight for the 99%.That's how we win back the working class.","title":"Is This How Democrats Win Back the Working Class?"},{"text":"In the same way that using the Broken Window analogy in an argument without crediting Bastiat would be plagiarism, yet no one would care, if anything, namedropping the person that first came up with every single argument you're making will just make you sound like a pretentious douche, which is completely counterproductive.   \\nWriting an opinion article by making the case for something using the best arguments available without taking away from it by bogging it down with name drops, references, ... is the most efficient way to make a case.   \\nThe fact that IP laws demands of us that we speak and act in inhuman and inefficient manners, says more about them that it does about normal people acting normally.If Milei was deliberately and maliciously trying to appropriate other people's work I would questions his ethics. Not even because of \\"stealing IP\\" which is a meaningless concept, but simply because the deception of it would make him untrustworthy.  \\nBut he is not, if you asked him where he got these arguments from he'd launch into a 2 hour presentation of Rothbard, as he has so often done. It's not like he's keeping his inspirations secret to better plagiarize them without people realizing, or pretending that he came up with everything himself.   \\nYou'd be hard pressed to find an acting head of state that has spent more time talking about exactly the books his philosophy is based on.  \\nSince there is neither deception nor malice, I see no reason to care, regardless of how this act could be framed in the nonsensical IP framework that exists today.Now, if you want to ride your high horses be my guest, but IP laws are almost (arguable) entirely garbage anyways, and every single one of us breaks them on a daily basis. So are we all bad people? Or only the ones that confirm your priors?","title":"Milei becomes a symbol of the global far right: We must put an end to the garbage of socialism once and for all"},{"text":"Kamala was so similar to republicans that she bragged about inviting republicans into her cabinet.

This had never been done before. Mid to low level bureaucrats were off limits. The Republicans tried raising a stink, but the MSM ignored it.

By the time Obama was elected, the DoJ and CIA was completely owned by the left and Obama used that to clear out the rest of the alphabet agencies. They were so close to fully taking over.
