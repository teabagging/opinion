Tariff duties paid will increase the price of imported goods [duh]. Consumers, off-put by higher prices, make fewer purchases as a result (less consumer demand). As purchases reduce, inventory of unsold imported product begins to build up (less scarcity). Business wanting to push product (whose value is declining by the day), will respond by reducing their asking price, desperately trying to sell for as much as they can.. while they can. Two. The prices of groceries are high not just because of corporate greediness boogeyman.. but because if say you are unwilling to pay said asking price.. then there is some other consumer who happily will. There is absolutely zero need any vendor to reduce prices IF demand for their product remains strong. As in the example in my previous paragraph, the need to reduce prices [at all] is reliant on consumer demand **as well as** amount of available product inventory it even has for sale. Huge unsold stockpile, due to low demand, results in lower &amp; lower prices. And vice versa. A shortage of inventory, due to high demand, results in higher &amp; higher prices. The current market price of ANY product and or service for sale considers **two factors**. A numerical range spanning a vendors highest list price, down to the lowest amount hes willing to accept. Another numerical range spanning a buyers lowest offer price, up to the highest amount hes willing to pay. Somewhere where these two numerical ranges overlap, a deal could be made. The amount both parties agree to becomes the sales price. The average price of many purchase transactions of same product becomes the market price. Supply and demand.","title":"CMV: You cant be an intelligent person and vote GOP"},{"text":"Define crimeThis isnt meant to be a trick coming to the US without going through legal channels IS a crime by definition.

If I gain my happiness from suffering, then is it moral for me to suffer?  Or if I gain my happiness from means that cause other people to suffer then are those means of happiness moral? What if the majority of people experience happiness from methods that cause a minority to experience suffering? Are those methods moral? I could go on with these types of questions. Additionally, what is the definition of suffering and happiness? Happiness doesn't really have a fixed, non-relative definition. The way we view happiness isn't the same as it has been viewed throughout history, even if we're only looking at it from a [eurocentric point of view. ](https://www.amacad.org/publication/daedalus/history-happiness-400-bc-ad-1780) So there is already an issue here with your definition of morality, which is for it to work we first have to come to an agreement on what suffering and happiness are. Then we have to ask what happens if one person's happiness clashes with another person causing the latter suffering? Or how do you balance the fact that there will inevitably be some so suffer at the expense of another being happy (think about someone suffering from a broken heart while their former lover is with a new partner). Lastly, not all cultures and philosophical outlooks view suffering (at least some) as inherently bad. Some view it as a good thing, a necessity to build a virtuous character. Some philosophical outlooks will see that too much happiness is bad and can lead one to be too prideful, and that for a healthy person they need some suffering and some happiness.","title":"CMV: Saudi Arabia exemplifies a society where cultural defenses serve as pretexts for systematic oppression"},{"text":"*waves from Missouri* hey, were pretty awful here too.","title":"White House condemns 'sickening' Nazi march in Columbus, Ohio"},{"text":"King won by 17%, which is his lowest % in his 3 elections, but I certainly wouldn't call it close.","title":"Biden could have repealed the Jones Act, but didn't because it was anti-union..."},{"text":"appeal to a wide swath of the electorateI'm a life in prison abolitionist, but I know it will go nowhere.

Go back to campus and try a social science class to see what I mean... How equally represented and respected are conservative perspectives? The typical response is \\"But the professionals agree...\\", but isn't this argument also the very hive mind you decry? Do these professionals tolerate and champion dissension within their ranks or is it squashed out? Go ahead, be honest. I know the answer.Unfortunately, you are coming at these from a liberal perspective of what conservatives represent (creating a caricature) and are not asking conservatives their perspectives directly. For example:* Conservatives don't support tariffs because they will bring down prices, they support them because they see jobs being shipped overseas where there are lower wages. That removes the jobs from this country.\\n* Grocery prices are high for a number of reasons, and conservatives don't think \\"the economy\\" was the only factor. However, I **hate** when liberals flip out over corporate greed... That is what a morally relativistic society creates. Any sane person could see the corporations salivating during the COVID chaos created by a shutdown conservatives saw as unnecessary, pointless, and Democrat led. Did it occur under Trump? Yes, but [governors ordered the shutdowns](https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html). Trump issued travel bans. Conservatives would argue that if you are vulnerable, stay home and isolate... Don't make the rest of the country do it. Then, a **bunch** of money was dumped into the economy under Biden, driving inflation through the roof. Why? Nobody I know saw a penny of benefit. Any Econ grad worth their salt could tell you that flooding the economy with money would drive up inflation. Are they not intelligent?\\n* I have never heard a single conservative make this argument. They are largely upset that the prices were cheaper under Trump and higher under Biden, but so is anybody putting gas in their tank. Also, conservatives are unhappy because the green technology agenda of the democrat party made it appear to them that the democrats didn't really care about the issue in the first place. Please point me to the speech where the democrats pledge to make fossil fuels cheaper and more readily accessible again.\\n* I think you forgot \\"stubbing my toe\\" in your list. Seriously though, ever notice how Putin moved on Ukraine twice under democrat leadership or Hamas attacked Israel under democrat leadership? To conservatives, this indicates that other countries don't fear or respect democrat leadership of our nation. Republicans may have the reputation of \\"hawks\\" or in Trump's case be unpredictable, but that helps keep things in line. If you can't predict your opponent, you play it safe. Many people like to blame the USA: \\"Yeah, but the USA initiated...\\" Quite frankly, conservatives don't care because they believe the USA has the right to look out for its own best interests, and being a superpower means the USA has dibs.\\n* This last point is kind of a catch-all for you. So I'll point out a few myself: Conservatives believe all illegal immigrants have committed a crime (entering illegally), women's bodily privacy should be protected, biology respected, natural consequences should result for gambling with carnal activity, human beings respected and valued at all life stages, death penalty as the ultimate price for taking the ultimate value, etc.All of these things can be supported by someone who is intelligent.

Hence, it is inherently good because it is the most efficient means of getting a nation to the objectively statistically good-for-humans state of affairs (no starvation, reasonable health care options, peace, etc.). It is inherently good as a process because it is the most likely of any system of government to lead to good substantive outcomes as a general principle.

After mid-2022, US inflation decreased significantly, while Europe's inflation stayed persistently high.Europe's economy is much more tightly integrated with Russia for obvious reasons, with energy being a massive import by many European nations. Sanctions and the Russian invasion in general led to a massive reduction in those imports, leading to massive price increases in the energy sector specifically. [Looking here at countries such as Germany and Italy, we can see the breakdown of their inflation rate starting in 2022 (which is when Europe started seeing higher inflation than the US).](https://www.cfr.org/tracker/global-inflation-tracker)  A huge amount of the inflation is driven by the energy sector, which is due to the integration of Russian energy into the European economy, which was disrupted by the invasion into Ukraine.This leads to a pretty convincing argument that the only reason US inflation is lower than European inflation is due to the impacts of the Russian invasion being felt more on Europe, as Europe's economy is far more integrated with Russia. Absent the invasion of Ukraine, its likely that US inflation would continue to be higher than European inflation.","title":"How Joe Bidens Gamble on Inflation Backfired - WSJ"},{"text":"I frequently refer to him as 'Joe 'the most progressive senator in congress' Manchin' to my progressive friends to trigger them.

Both are essentially saying that there is nothing - that when it comes to good democracy is empty.  So if there is a distinction to my mind it is meaningless, at least in this context. You are asking two questions and only one relates to the real question. Good is not binary - that is if A is good and B is better, the existence of B does not make A not-good.  Maybe your mom makes the best apple pie, but the corner restaurant has one that is good.  So it isnt necessary to prove the theory that democracy kicks ass above all other forms of government.  It is only necessary to demonstrate at least one acceptable redeeming quality that is a fundamental characteristic of its deployment.  Ive already mentioned one of these but here it is again and a few more.  Again, only one needs to be true. - Voting allows the redress of grievances without violence. \\n- Protects individual freedom \\n- Reduces the risk of abusive tyranny \\n- Protects human rightsYou ask if democracy could fall at these good things. Yes it can and in fact has on many occasions. But this gets to the absurdity of absolutes.  Pure democracy does not exist any more than you can resolve Russells Paradix in mathematics.  The idea of democracy works in real life in much the same way that you can do maths without being bothered by whether a set can contain itself.  Go too far that Rabbit Hole and you are back at the cave asking if anyone or anything is real.  Not very utilitarian. And the idea of democracy has value. It is good.  In and of itself.  Could other systems also be good? Perhaps. But thats not the question.It is **good enough** compared to other options, especially when properly managed.  The mitigation of human rights abuses stands out above the other benefits, not likely to be prominent in an autocracy or corporaticracy.And I get that this isnt a pure utilitarian philosophical lens.

Its absolutely a worth while endeavor to ensure that these drugs are not causing more harm than good, but youd be very surprised to learn how much time, testing and effort is put into clinical trials. The unfortunate truth is that these trials and developments are so incrediblydrab. Boring. A oh so godly technical. I get to work for a major healthcare organization and I sit through countless Continuing Medical Education credits and get a glimpse into the the lives of these Doctors. Trust me, theyre not up to anything nefarious.  Theyre fucking nerds. And some of the more specialized doctors, like the ones that do endoscopic surgery through the throat to treat hard to reach areas are fucking rockstars. They are so incredibly skilled as are any high stakes doctor that does operations. All these people feed their data into other data. They make precedents that serve the basis of other research and its double triple and quadruple checked by people.Sometimes, they get it wrong. Sometimes, they get it very very wrong and some get away with malpractice. Theres absolutely a level of corruption out there. But every year that passes, accountability, especially in the medical field, becomes more and more accurate. On the aggregate, these doctors and medical scientists are pretty accurate and to boot, are simply incredible to witness as their knowledge basis about their specialty is miles beyond the average persons basic capacity. Theres really a good reason why its so difficult to become a doctor, the standards are quite high. And if you want to go down the road of making your own medicine, well, you need a fucking warchest to do so. And time. Lots and lots of time to pour over data and repeat that data and then repeat it again and prove beyond a statistical basis that your evidence is correct. Then, you have to let other non-invested parties audit your data. And each one of these people are all highly valued making substantial incomes. That shit costs an insane amount of money. Like I said, a war chest. So, if youre willing to front the 10s of millions of dollars it takes to go through the process (and possibly fail along the way, many many medicines simply dont come to fruition because they are dangerous or cant be proven beyond a statistical threshold). All that money can be gone in an instant. Its never just one person funding this research. And mostly likely, the failed product can lead to something else as you discover something along the way. Or you pivot. Or you abandon and chalk it up to the cost of doing business. And if your a conglomerate that is putting together large swaths of funds to research the viability of a drug in the very first rounds, well, youre putting up a lot of money. Why invest it there if the pay out wasnt extraordinary? Big risk better have a fuck ton of reward. Otherwise, just put your money in a traditional investment and earn a nominal return.So, when you have groups of high rolling investors, more often than not they are very well versed in the project, many times with a medical back ground. If youre a researcher and youve discovered a novel treatment, well, you gotta convince an investor. And believe me, these investors dont invest in an extremely risky venture if there wasnt a possibility of a large return. So you better bet they do their homework. These people want to make money, and to get approved for any new drugs require an influx of serious money. And the people with money dont let it go without a good reason, so if you want money, you better be able to prove efficacy rate cause if it doesnt look like its going to work, the funding goes bye bye. Its not some giant cabal that wants to make and keep you sick. Its really like more dull than that. Unfortunately.But that doesnt meant there isnt great fault to many of these practices. The opioid epidemic is 100% the fault of pharma greed. Absolutely 100%. But the legislation and new regulations make getting opioids pretty hard to get compared to years ago. And thats a good thing. You can thank those regulations to massive litigation that won 10s of billions of dollars. You know what the real conspiracy theory is? Where the fuck is that money? Seriously. Where the fuck is that money. Go ask you local congress person about how the funds from those settlements are being allocated in your neighborhood, especially if it was ravaged by opioids. Theres literally billions sitting on the table ear marked to be spent.

Autonomy is good, because from a utilitarian perspective, it is most likely to ensure that it produces outcomes are beneficial to most people in the society, because the consent of most people is required to either make a decision or to elect the decision makers, depending on whether you find yourself in the legislature or the voting booth. You introduced a hypothetical scenario when comparing a nation with high autonomy and low standard of living, and a nation with low autonomy and high standard of living. In reality, you need to make a comparison of four:A high standard of living autocracy, a low standard of living autocracy, a high standard of living democracy, and a low standard of living democracy. In a high standard of living Democracy, the electorate can keep voting the party in power in so long as that standard of living is maintained. The party in power is motivated to keep that standard of living, because there are competing parties who will deliver this standard of living should the ruling party fail to do so. In a low standard of living Democracy, the people can vote out their leaders, and elect more competent ones. It may be a slow process, but the people, as masters of their own destinies, will need to be motivated to elect good leaders, in which case they own their own success, or fail to do so, in which they can only blame themselves for the situation they find themselves in. The important part though is that they can vote - this is a pressure release valve that stops a violent revolution from happening. In a high standard of living autocracy, the people have no control over whether the person in power continues to provide such a high standard. What happens when the leader stops providing this standard? There is no way to guarantee the person in charge, in an autocracy, will continue to provide high standards, because the only motivation of doing so is keeping power, or the benevolence of the leader, neither of which provide certainty. How do you know the leader will continue to be competent? What about his successor? There is a danger that in the future, the new leader wont be able or willing to do this. Monarchal France is an example of this. The Monarch eventually failed to maintain a standard of living to the average French citizen, and resisted reform. He was beheaded.  In a low standard of living autocracy, to keep power, it is necessary to use force to keep the people in check. The threat of violence and oppression, I would argue, is inherently bad. A benevolent autocracy may not need to resort to such methods, though thered be nothing stopping them from doing so, but in a low standard of living autocracy, what limited resources exist are spent on making the state powerful, and keeping the people unable to change their destiny - unless they revolt violently. This is Imperial Russia - the Czars for centuries left much of Russia backwards and impoverished. The Communists - who, while not democratic, are *more* democratic than an absolute monarch - won the revolution and killed the Czars. The Communists too eventually failed their promise to maintain a standard of living, after which they collapsed.  Time will tell if Putin has learned from this and the modern Russian state - again, more democratic than its predecessor, but still autocratic - will survive. So, its not that I dont believe in metrics that capture success of a nation. Rather, a well functioning democracy has a better incentive to keep functioning well, while a poorly functioning democracy has built in methods to improve things. A well functioning autocracy is dependent on the leaders competence and ability to perform well, while a badly functioning autocracy has every incentive to make things worse for the people. You mentioned Thomas Hobbes in your original post, and I would like to engage with you on Leviathan. The idea that people are inherently evil is a bit of an oversimplication - one I myself once held. Rather, in a state of nature where no government exists we are incentivized to engage in bad behavior, because there is no mechanism outside of force preventing others from enacting bad behavior on us. The maxim that any man can kill any man, or be killed by any man, means that we are at high risk of having force used against us, and therefore are incentivized to use force first. Because there is no mechanism to enforce agreement between people, agreements can only be enforced by indivisible force - meaning that it is no agreement at all. Because of this, we give up a portion of our inherent autonomy in order to take away that same portion of autonomy from others. This is how we leave the state of nature, also known as the state of war. That is to say that, even in a Hobbsian system, government is still achieved by the consent of the governed. Hobbes was not pro dictatorship - he was pro monarchy, and monarchy differentiates itself by legitimacy. The people consent to be governed by the monarch in exchange for the monarch not using force against them to achieve rule. That is to say, I recognize the warlord has a big stick and a lot of freind. I agree to do what he says, so that he will not beat me with that stick to convince me to follow him anyway. While Hobbes is not pro democracy, there are portions of the text that allow for a logical, not stretched implication that supports democracy. By consenting to the rule of the ruler, the people leave the state of nature with eachother, but the monarch does not leave the state of nature vis a vis the people, because he retains all of his original rights under the state of nature, including the use of force. While I doubt Hobbes would agree with my reading of his text, there is an implied right to revolution here - the people owe allegiance to the monarch as long as he or she fulfills their covenant to provide security and an acceptable standard of living to the people. If that security and standard of living is not provided, there is an inherent right to revolution - so long as the balance of power allows for it. However, in a democracy, all people leave the state of nature. There is no monarch that retains the inherent right to use force. The crown is transformed into a legislature, which is occupied entirely by citizens who have consented to the social contract, and can be removed without the need for violence.  So, to conclude, autonomy is good, because we inherently have autonomy, and we give it up to be governed. A democracy trades more individual autonomy in decision making for the right of the people to revolt, because they have consented to use elections, not violence, to replace their leaders. Its also worth noting that we live in a time where literacy and education rates are much higher worldwide than they were in the past.

In contrast to Trump's economy that left half the country broke and unemployed, we are now at stabilized inflation and outperforming every other developed economy in the world.* Unemployment under Trump stood at 6.7% the month before Biden took office. It's now at 4.1%.\\n* The DOW was around 30-31k around the time Biden won and got inaugurated. It's now at 43,400.\\n* Similarly, the S&amp;P 500 was at around 3,700 when Trump left. It is now at 5,900.\\n* Inflation-adjusted GDP under Trump averaged 2.67% before COVID and 1.4% after. Biden's average stands at something like 3.5%.\\n* The national debt rose 39% under Trump, skyrocketing long before COVID due to his costly corporate tax cuts. It rose 25% under Biden, who had to spend a fortune to get us out of Trump's inflicted COVID mess.\\n* Median wages are higher than before the pandemic, even after adjusting for inflation. The typical U.S. worker out-earned inflation by $1,400 a year, according by a recent report.So explain to me how Trump was good for the economy, again? Trump inherited a stable economy and still failed to keep any of his growth promises before running up the debt and destroying it all during COVID. Biden inherited a devastating post-pandemic recession and massive inflation, and we're now in a better position than under Trump.

However, it's fair to say that this unemployment was due at least in part to Trump's mishandling of the pandemic.The current unemployment rate sits at 4.1%, which is a marked improvement from the COVID times. Under Biden, the unemployment rate has hovered between 3.7% and 4.1% since 2022, which is fairly stable.While it's not record-breaking, these numbers are quite reasonable. According to the research I'm seeing, an unemployment rate between 3% and 5% is effectively ideal for ensuring that there's enough work for everyone without increasing inflation.EDIT: If I'm going to be downvoted when I'm giving rather unbiased data, I'll ask that you do me the decency of actually replying to me and stating what about my data offended you.","title":"Dont Give Trump Credit for the Success of the Biden Economy"},{"text":"The quality of politics reporting is so low these days.

As for Tulsi, she singlehandedly took Kamala Harris out of the race in a 2019 primary debate. But then she received no support from the DNC in her presidential bid. She was in the National Guard and served as a Congresswoman for 8 years. She eventually left the Democrats and was dragged through the mud in the media, simply for opposing policies she disagreed with. Lastly, if you look at what was in the border bill, it was loaded with expansive provisions that made it a poison pill that the Democrats tried to ram through:* new pathway to citizenship for illegals (which Republicans argued would further incentivize illegal crossings)\\n* allowing surge crossings of up to 5,000 daily encounters before enacting stricter border measures\\n* added 250,000 visas over 5 years and protections for documented dreamers \\n* the bill maintained parole programs used to admit hundreds of thousands of Haitians, Cubans, Nicaraguans, and others that they were using to sidestep standard immigration processes.\\n* permanent legal status for Afghans\\n* increased funding for border infrastructure \\n \\nThats all I can remember off the top of my head. Some were bi-partisan, but most of the bill was expansive of Democrats immigration agenda, and it did very little to actually fix the problem of the massive surges in illegal crossings. Of course, when the bill failed to pass, Republicans were blamed for not wanting to fix the problem. Trump knew that an expansive bill was not necessary, as Biden had rolled back effective policies of Trump, such as Remain in Mexico. All he needed to do was put them back in place, and the problem wouldve been solved.

In fact theres a very small portion of men in America who have a combat MOS. And if a woman is an exception to the rule why cant she serve in a combat MOS? I have a funny feeling you don't actually know what the combat in the 21st century looks like. Or the structure of the United States Military. A MAJOR in the national guard doesn't mean he's fit to be SECDEF or a leader. He hasn't even led a battalion yet. I dont even know if he had any KD time as a commander at all. This is the issue with men like him and you. Yall think because youre a man, you're strong and fought in combat makes you an effective leader. LEADERSHIP is a different ball game.

Plus, these voters have been psychologically conditioned for decades by the Republican Party to distrust government, distrust experts, and were repeatedly told that Democrats are crazed, radical liberals. So stuck in a circle of confusion during the barrage of campaign rhetoric they experienced in the general election, with too much misinformation, they went with what they knew: Their standard of living was better under Trump. And worse under Biden and Harris.Then when you wonder why they never believed the bad things about Trump? It's not just because they've been taught to mistrust Democrats. But also because fascists, when they do terrible and criminal things, they just accuse the opposite party of it, too. Trump and his civil trial for rape? That's when they started their creepy Joe narrative about Biden and children.

Many may well have formed their their opinion based on the understood credibility of available information. The claim generally being made isn't that one Haitian ate one cat; it's that Haitian immigrants are taking and eating dogs and cats. That this is something the members of the Haitian community in general or a significant section of the community are doing. And with such claims, one has to look at whether available credible information supports or does not support those claims. In Springfield, the local police and government officials have come out to report that they have received  0 credible reports of Haitian immigrants taking and eating people's pets. There's no records of any notable increase in pets being taken/going missing.  If Haitian immigrants where taking and eating pets in any significant way, the city would likely have gotten some sort of credible reports of it happening or at least some noticeable increase in missing pets in recent years. The lack of credible evidence would indicate that Haitian immigrants in Springfield as a group likely aren't going around eating people's pets. From that it is reasonable to think that the claims of Haitians eating pets are generally false, unless or until some credible evidence emerged of Haitian people eating pets.","title":"CMV: You cant be an intelligent person and vote GOP"},{"text":"This is a good and perceptive comment and you should feel good.

However, tent cities of fent zombies in SF, storefronts closing, and essential items locked up due to shoplifting get blamed on Democrats not being tough enough on crime.

Propaganda Strategy C Tactical Focus:\\n  - **Leverage Republican Fiscal Rhetoric:** Republicans have established a strong narrative around \\"fiscal responsibility\\" by highlighting Democratic spending as wasteful. To counter this, the strategy must focus on isolating specific Republican-backed spending initiatives that can be framed as wasteful or controversial.\\n  - **Amplify Small Issues:** Even minor expenditures must be framed as disproportionately wasteful by leveraging Republican tactics of exaggerating issues.\\n  - **Narrow Focus on Deficits:** Target Republican bills or programs that involve deficits or overspending while holding them accountable for contradictions between their fiscal policies and actual spending.\\n  - **Create an Opposition Trap:** Frame these wasteful programs in such a way that Republicans must either defend them (and appear out of touch) or distance themselves (and lose credibility with their base). 2. Tactical Amplification C Identify Vulnerable Programs:\\n- **Small but Symbolic Expenditures:** Focus on programs that have small, yet impactful financial implications. These are often overlooked, but through targeted messaging, can be amplified to appear as egregious.\\n  - Example: Programs with minuscule but controversial budgets (e.g., specific military contractors, corporate subsidies) can be made to appear as emblematic of Republican waste.\\n  - **Public Misconceptions:** Utilize areas where the public might not have full insight, but where media coverage and strategic messaging can help create outrage.\\n  \\n- **Contrast with Republican Rhetoric:**\\n  - **Tax Cuts:** Publicize programs where Republicans have proposed large-scale cuts to taxes for corporations and the wealthy while simultaneously funding controversial or wasteful initiatives. Frame this contrast as hypocrisy.\\n  - **Highlight Republican Opposition:** Identify instances where Republicans oppose universally supported, beneficial programs (e.g., middle-class tax cuts) to amplify their inconsistency. 3. Surgical Leverage C Amplifying Specific Programs:\\n- **Focus on Single, High-Impact Issues:**\\n  - Choose one or two small but symbolic Republican-backed programs to target at a time. These should be issues with limited but public-facing budgets that can be portrayed as emblematic of larger wastefulness.\\n  - Example: Exaggerate the financial inefficiencies of funding high-cost, low-impact programs (e.g., corporate tax breaks, military contracts with minimal public benefit).- **Exploit the Media:**  \\n  - Create or identify media narratives around these programs and use them as wedge issues.\\n  - Use specific, easy-to-understand statistics or figures to illustrate waste.\\n  - Tie the program to broader national concerns (e.g., deficit spending, social welfare) to make the issue feel larger.\\n  \\n- **Utilize Public Outrage Mechanisms:**  \\n  - Amplify through social media and grassroots campaigning. Encourage public discourse, creating a feedback loop where the issue becomes larger due to media and public amplification.\\n  - Use shareable infographics, easy-to-read statistics, and impactful, emotionally charged messaging.\\n  \\n- **Highlight Republican Denials or Defenses:**  \\n  - If Republicans defend the spending, strategically highlight their defense as detached from reality, out of touch with public concerns, or hypocritical based on their stated fiscal positions. 4. Messaging Efficiency C High-Impact Communication:\\n- **Clear, Direct Messaging:**  \\n  - Use simple, direct language to highlight the wastefulness of Republican programs. Focus on the financials (e.g., \\"X million dollars spent on Y\\") and how it contrasts with the Republican narrative of fiscal conservatism.\\n  - Example: Focus on high-cost defense projects or corporate tax breaks and position them as wasteful spending that harms the American people.- **Visual Tools:**  \\n  - Create clear, concise visual content to distill complex issues into easy-to-digest narratives (e.g., comparison charts, meme-style posts).- **Emotional Appeal:**  \\n  - Tie the wasteful spending narrative to real-world consequences for ordinary people (e.g., cuts to social services, education, or healthcare), turning the Republican program into a symbol of negligence. 5. Political Leverage C Force Strategic Positioning:\\n- **Trap Republican Responses:**\\n  - Frame the issue in such a way that any Republican response either:\\n    - Forces them to defend the spending (making them appear out of touch), or\\n    - Forces them to distance themselves, creating division within their party.- **Undermine Republican Authority on Fiscal Responsibility:**\\n  - By showcasing these targeted, wasteful programs, undermine the Republican claim to be the party of fiscal responsibility and budget management.\\n  - Frame this as a moral issue (spending taxpayer money wastefully) to generate stronger emotional responses from the public.# Key Contextual Considerations:\\n- **Public Sentiment:** Leverage public dissatisfaction with perceived waste in government. Even small expenditures, when framed as wasteful or disproportionate, can trigger outrage.\\n  \\n- **Timing and Relevance:** Use specific moments of fiscal or budgetary discussions (e.g., federal budget debates, election cycles) to raise these issues at the most impactful time.\\n  \\n- **Framing Tactics:** Use terms like \\"fiscal irresponsibility,\\" \\"wasteful spending,\\" \\"corporate handouts,\\" or \\"inefficient government programs\\" to consistently reinforce the narrative.","title":"What programs do republicans fund that can be considered wasteful or controversial?

If America has the capacity to provide that punishment and the home nation is less likely to do so then isnt that arguably worth it? Secondly you are depriving the world of a murderer over the period they are imprisoned. Thirdly, ideally (and this seems to be rarely the case in practice) correctional facilities are supposed to be correctional soJ would hope that yes, immigrant or no, prison should decrease the chances of repeat offence.On your?second point, this is unworkable and unjust idea in practice. A country, simply by virtue of its geography as neighbour to an unstable nation, should not be shouldered with the responsibility of accepting all or many of its asylum seekers simply by virtue of geography alone. A diffuse distribution of asylum seekers where they can be feasibly accommodated is far more equitable and less likely to lead to international resentment.?This is a great cause of resentment between Mediterranean countries and their northern neighbours in the EU for instance.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"Democrats are well aware of the ramifications of another Trump administration, aka the DC Dumpster Fire.","title":"Democratic voters experiencing schadenfreude watching Trump's next term coming together ..."},{"text":"Okay, the accusation that Joe Biden is committing genocide in Israel is pure propaganda.We don't have troops over there...

There are a variety of factors that affect people's likelihood of receiving a college education. Growing up an area where there is a decent quality of education increases one's chances of getting into college, while being educated in schools that have a lower quality of education, less resources, and poorer funding will tend to decrease one's chances of getting into college. If you grow up in a lower income family, it's harder to afford to go to college than someone from a wealthier family. I have two master's degrees. I had to rely on scholarships and student loans to afford college and relied on help from family. If those things weren't available, I wouldn't have been able to go to college, no matter how intelligent I am. My father wasn't able to go college when he was young. Not because he wasn't smart, but because he grew up in a low income family and had to work to help support his family. Socio-economic inequalities on the family and community level, as well as state and national level support for education, effect the likelihood of a person being able to attend college. Additionally, factors such a whether a person's preferred career requires a degree or involves some other form of preparation, can effect personal decisions on whether to pursue a college education. For instance, if you are intelligent person who is interested a more manual or craft based trade, you may opt for pursuing vocational/trade based training and certification rather than going to college. Additionally, there are broader factors beyond intelligence that can shape people's partisan inclinations. A person's community life, social relations, the kind of media they watch, the kind of news they read, etc... can effect their general opinions on different political parties and certain policies. While intelligence can help with independent thinking, a person being surrounded with people who are mostly aligned with the same party and/or mainly getting their information from sources that favor a certain party, can make them more likely to align with that party. Furthermore, each of the major parties have tended to focus on reaching out to certain subsets of the population to appeal to them, try to convince most of those in those subsets their party is more favorable to their interests, and seeking to mobilize to vote for their party. With that, major parties may align themselves to supporting certain issues that certain subsets of Americans care deeply about and to convince people that they should side with their party. An intelligent person who care deeply about a certain issue, may side with a certain issue or issues may align with a certain party because advancing preferred policies on these issues is their priority. And this may lead to them overlooking or minimizing other policies that they don't agree with or may think are stupid. Also, when it comes to intelligence, being smart doesn't necessarily make one immune to being mislead or convinced of ridiculous things. In my years in academia, scholarship, and political and community involvement, I've come across all sorts of intelligent people, who are normally informed and thoughtful, who have been convinced of some pretty misguided or ridiculous ideas/positions. Often its connected to some faulty idea that they haven't sufficiently thought over, some unconscious bias that they haven't recognized and addressed through critical thinking, a lack of exposure to more sensible ideas on an issues, and/or some heavy emotional attachment to certain ideas and positions. Sometimes a person being smart and knowledgeable in certain aspects can lead them to become overconfident about their understanding of other topics. And finally, the type of views that an intelligent, informed member of a party may have a different view of an issue than how an average or lower informed member of that party may have. For instance, there a Republican aligned scholars and economists who favor increased tariffs. Their support is generally not because they think tariffs will make things cheaper. They recognize that tariffs will make foreign made products subject to them more expensive, but that making them more expensive can help enable domestic manufactures/producers to produce things at a relatively more competitive price, and favor the growth of American industries. They believe that the potential growth in American manufacturing and domestic production would have a net-positive effect on the country's economy in comparison to the increased prices.","title":"CMV: You cant be an intelligent person and vote GOP"},{"text":"I was getting frustrated until I realized it was satire.

The rent control was not an actual rent control, assuming she followed the same plan Biden had proposed. The \\"cap\\" on rent hikes would only impact eligiblity for a limited number of tax breaks, would be temporary and only apply to older rentals. While that might still be distortionary, it's *nothing* like a normal rent control law. Same with the \\"price controls\\". Price gouging laws are on the books in many states already and their distortionary effects are relevant but incredibly rare (since major emergencies themselves are incredibly rare). They're not good, but it's not typical price controls by any measure and they're inherently rare and therefore not very distortionary overall.The so called unrealized gains tax was the closest to being bad, but even that isn't just an unrealized gains tax. It would have likely been the Billionaire Minimum Income Tax https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2022/03/28/presidents-budget-rewards-work-not-wealth-with-new-billionaire-minimum-income-tax/It has a few important caveats.1: Payments are spread out over more than a decade, which helps alleviate the issue of \\"well what about capital losses in the next year?\\"The proposal allows wealthy households to spread initial top-up payments on unrealized income over nine years, and then five years for top-up payments on new income going forward. Stretching payment over multiple years will smooth year-to-year variation in investment income, while still ensuring that the wealthiest end up paying a minimum tax rate of 20 percent. Illiquid taxpayers may opt to pay later with interest.2: It has a limit.If a wealthy household is already paying 20 percent on their full income C standard taxable income plus unrealized income C they will pay no additional tax under this proposal. If tax-free unrealized income allows a wealthy household to pay less than 20 percent on their full income, they will owe a top-up payment to meet the 20 percent minimum. As a result, this new minimum tax will eliminate the ability for the unrealized income of ultra-high-net-worth households to go untaxed for decades or generations.3: This was after they tried to directly target the stepped-up basis issue and failed because of political backlash and lies https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/04/02/the-white-house-wants-to-close-a-tax-loophole-used-by-the-ultra-richA simple way to close this loophole would be to recognise all capital gains upon inheritance. Indeed that was Mr Bidens preference in legislation last year. But opponents tarred it as a death tax that would bankrupt family farms. Although that charge was unfairalmost all farms would have been below the tax thresholdthe Democrats dropped the idea.I think this actually shows a really big issue with campaigning. Voters do not know the details. Even most people here on NL, a sub about policy discussions *rarely know the details* and most journalists *don't go into the details*. Those policies might still be bad, but many of them were either just straight up not what people imagined or had plans (whether they would be successful or not) to address the obvious critiques that people continued to throw at them anyway because they did not know the details already covered it to begin with.","title":"Matthew Yglesias: Biden tried to make up for Democrats weaknesses with working class voters on cultural issues by going further left on economics too and it didnt work.

We saw this recently to our disadvantage with topics like Dobbs where, no, Biden couldn't just make Mississippi or Florida have reasonable abortion laws. Now there are a ton of blue states which will fight anything unconstitutional. Most swing states (NC, MI, WI, MN, AZ, PA) have Dem governors, NV has a GOP gov but state assembly and senate D majority, states like KS, KY, have Dem governors, etc. And that's even before considering the lower courts and SCOTUS (which while it has a conservative lean, at least 5-7 of the 9 are not complete hacks depending on topic, and even Alito and Thomas have rejected some crazier right-wing stuff).* The GOP thrive as obstructionists and destructionists. They struggle to enact or create. When they have power, as we saw in 2016 when they had a larger 241-191 House majority and 52-48 Senate majority, they still struggled to do more than weaken (not obliterate, thankfully) the ACA and pass tax cuts for the rich. This time around there are more MAGA faithful in power but their margins are still weaker. It's easier to mess up a working system but harder to create a system that does active harm.* The GOP coalition is more fragmented and smaller than it looks. If the post-election takes are correct, enough people voted GOP because of economic anxiety, not because they care about illegal immigrants or LBGTQ or whatever. When people see Trump spending more time dealing with that than the economy, or see worse gas/food/shop prices because of his economic plan, then they'll be ripe for swinging back to Dems in 2026 and 2028. And in the meanwhile people aren't gonna want to see resources devoted to his nonsense.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 18, 2024"},{"text":"Americans have adopted a Putin esque complex about Netanyahu.

However, due to general understaffing in ICE they don't have the capacity to go pick up each and every immigrant convicted of any crime and deport them.Instead they focus on deporting those convicted of major crimes, reoffendors and those who have been deported multiple times once they have completed their jail time.Those with minor offenses are released from jail and basically told to self deport.Now the problem with the plan by Trump and the Republicans is that they have explicitly said that it will not stop with illegal immigrants.  They have stated publicly that they plan to also go after legal immigrants and first generation citizens by denaturalizing them, revoking citizenship and deporting them somewhere..  You do not have to be a criminal either to be subject to denaturalization and deportation according to what they have stated publicly.Trump has stated publicly in various interviews that he wants to deport between 2 and 24 million people.  You cannot do this without setting up detention camps to process people out.  This will make the immigrant detention camps set up in trumps first presidency seem like child's play and those were BAD.  People DIED in those camps and were abused starved and raped by the guards.  Many people were straight up lost in the system because of poor records.  We literally have no idea what happened to them.  Families were separated and children were given to fly by night non profits and foster families and disappeared never to be found.  Do you think things will be any better when the sheer scale is multiplied by 50-100x what we saw before?That's what people are worried about.Incidentally, if you are a Christian, the Bible is VERY clear on how immigrants should be treated.  They are to be welcomed and treated as a loved one or neighbor.  This plan is BLATENTLY against the teachings of Christ and the word of God.  You literally cannot be a Christian if you support this.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"Kinda feel like our intelligence agencies failed us though.

As generous and kind as we are as a nation, have you considered the fact that our actions are almost always done for economic or security reasons and not human rights or benevolence? I guess, from your view I dont think youve considered that we may need them more than they need us. Even the criminals, I assume those who committed violent offenses are likely in prison and not roaming the streets. Or that there are reasons why neither political party has ever demanded mass deportation before. To the criminal point, if someone is a criminal it means they have been convicted of a crime (people are innocent until proven guilty, so were not talking about people we assume might be committing them). Some crimes are like having marijuana or may reflect a bad decision and not bad character, being in America without authorization isnt itself a crime and many who are undocumented came into America legally, they are violating a law but not committing a crime. So, to be clear, were talking about criminals, people who have been convicted of committing a crime. And were talking about all immigrants, people from all other countries and all economic classes and educational backgrounds. If our system is just, it should be enforced equally to a wealthy businessman who had a DUI ten years ago, as a sex trafficker, a poor laborer who assaulted someone, and drug dealers. Wed also need to consider that violent crimes, like murder or aggravated robbery tend to carry long minimum prison terms and these individuals are likely in prison. We dont like wasting money, so why do you think wed prefer to house these criminals now instead of deport them when convicted? For example, under your law we would deport El Chapo back to Mexico.It sounds like something everyone would agree to in general, but I think thats because a lot of us automatically assume who you are talking about and thats not the reality of who it would involve. People who have committed a crime are not automatically a net negative to society, in fact most are still a net positive, see Martha Stewart. A farm owner would likely not want to lose all of their workers who were caught with weed in the past. Until we have the skill and ability to replace the labor they provide, or we are going to be discriminate in how we apply our laws, I dont think this idea is as good in practice as it sounds on paper.","title":"CMV: there's nothing wrong with deporting unauthorized immigrants who have committed a crime and have no US-citizen spouses/children"},{"text":"yeah, if it's all that's gonna work for now then it's what needs to be done","title":"The conservative ecosystem made a big bet that lying constantly about every Dem policy position would help win on Election Day.

Again, not a 100% fix for this, but it's a starting point that could help to cut into the margins.Asking a question is an incredibly powerful strategy for situations like this.  Because asking the question means you care about the answer.  And it forces the other person to think about the answer.  And the thing is, these folks often haven't thought about the answer before.  That's how biases work.  Sometimes, it's just enough to make them go 'huh, guess that idea actually doesn't make sense'.  Maybe not in the moment, but it's part of the process.And from an electoral standpoint, I'm also a fan of the head-on approach.  When we're ashamed of what we support, people pick up on that.  And we don't want to create the impression that supporting rights for everyone is shameful.

I think I understand it now. It's an answer with many parts. 1. We lost the popular vote because we lost the most ground in safe blue states, and particularly in the high population ones. California trended R+8, New York trended R+11, Illinois trended R+7, New Jersey trended R+10, Massachusetts trended R+9, and Maryland trended R+6. A troubling fact is that Republicans did twice as good on average in safe blue states. The average trend for the swing states and likely Democratic states is R+3. The average in the safe blue states is R+6. That's a lot of votes lost. 2. Republicans overperformed in Texas and Florida. Texas and Florida are the 2nd and 3rd most populated states, and Republicans did crazy good in them. Florida trended R+9 and Texas disappointingly trended R+8. These hugely populated states decided that Trump was their guy, taking potentially millions of votes from us. 3.Not enough time. This one is somewhat speculative so bear with me. I saw a poll that validating something I was concerned about. It said that swing voters who decided before September went to Trump by a large margin, but in the next 3 months they broke for Harris by a large margin. She was winning people over, but she just didn't have enough time. If she had the normal amount of time to campaign, I really think she would be favored to win. I truly believe we had a winning campaign that was let down by a time crunch, economic anxiety, and a worldwide anti-incumbent sentiment.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 18, 2024"},{"text":" And then theyll deport anybody not born on US soil.Bye Elon!

Corporations can only gouge because the economy isnt doing well. Thats what price gouging is, taking advantage of some economic problem. Do you have evidence that their profit margins are significantly higher? And, even if the profit margin is up in the grocery sector, that doesnt mean the economy is doing well overall. Have you seen how the price of eggs went up and down? Why did the price of eggs come down? Did corporations suddenly lose the profit motive?  ?Claiming that gas prices post 2020 were down because of Trump and not low fuel demand during the Pandemic, and believing that theyre back up again because of Biden and not higher demand.

Thinking prices on groceries are high due to the Economy and not corporate price gouging. The economy affects everyone, and these corporations would not be making record profit if it was just an economy issue. Once again this could be proven with research but no research is ever done.I'm just going to pick on one specific claim that I think is clearly wrong, but I think it's a significant one since inflation was probably the biggest pain point in this election: **Corporate price gouging has close to zero explanatory power as a source of inflation.**1) General corporate greediness is already priced into the market. Corporations have been greedy ever since the first corporation was invented. Their structure necessitates it because their primary fiduciary obligation is to their shareholders. So corporate greed can't explain fluctuations in inflation. Why did it specifically shoot up circa 2020-22?2) Greed doesn't lead to price gouging. Corporations are subject to both *price effects* and *quantity effects*. Corporations make more money per unit by raising prices, but they sell more units in total by lowering prices. These two effects settle at an equilibrium; they don't lead to unbounded price increases. A purely greedy corporation has every reason to keep prices low enough that it can't be undercut by other greedy competitors who would love to capture its market share.3) Inflation describes the relationship between the amount of money in circulation and the amount of real value in the economy. The average price of goods in the economy can't change unless one half of that equation changes. Any explanation blaming corporate greed would need to explain how corporations are somehow raising the money supply or else why corporations have an incentive to *reduce* output, which hurts their own bottom line.4) The main explanation given in the OP is that \\"corporations [made] record profits,\\" but that's not true. The stock market was in shambles for almost the [entire duration of COVID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash). Specific companies like Amazon made record profits, but isn't that what you'd expect? With everyone forced inside and onto the Internet, the one sector that benefits massively is the tech sector.And then to turn to Kamala's proposed anti-price gouging laws:A) Normal price gouging laws target specific products at narrowly defined times. E.g. \\"No raising gasoline prices in the immediate aftermath of a hurricane.\\" She never defined even in her longform policy document exactly what she had in mind, but if her proposal looks anything like existing price gouging laws, it would have vanishingly little impact on inflation because these laws are not intended to tackle broad, sustained price increases.B) These laws are not even obviously good things! While there's a lot of intuitive appeal to \\"don't let corporations jack up prices to take advantage of people facing disaster,\\" those high prices reflect a real change in market demand: all of a sudden, a huge number of people want a very limited supply of gasoline. If prices don't rise to match, you face problems like people overstocking gasoline to hoard it, or overbuying it to scalp it and claim that profit for themselves. High prices push consumers to only buy as much as they *need*, which prevents shortages and allows limited supplies of gas to go further.C) Kamala's campaign messaging suggested she might have had something more expansive than the above in mind because she kept pitching anti-price gouging legislation as a solution to grocery costs which, per (A), the above laws wouldn't affect. And if we're talking about longterm sustained regulations on the price of a wide variety of products at supermarkets, now we're entering the territory of *price controls*, which are almost universally hated by economists because they create structural shortages of basic goods as prices aren't allowed to rise to meet demand.","title":"CMV: You cant be an intelligent person and vote GOP"},{"text":"Cry more, this video has not been posted here ever.","title":"Reddit is compromised"},{"text":"So we learned Gen Z is fucking stupid, and lack anything nearing basic critical thinking.","title":"The Not-So-Woke Generation Z - The same young people once derided as liberal snowflakes are moving to the right."},{"text":"The McChips act","title":"Biden locks in $6.6B for TSMC chip factories, ensuring Trump cant rescind CHIPS Act deal"},{"text":"Google put your mother in a straight jacket mike tyson","title":"The Not-So-Woke Generation Z - The same young people once derided as liberal snowflakes are moving to the right."},{"text":"We condemn this in the strongest possible terms, but you voted for more of this so fuck it wouldve hit so much harder.","title":"White House condemns 'sickening' Nazi march in Columbus, Ohio"},{"text":"0!","title":"Oklahoma Superintendent Demands Students Watch Him Pray for Trump"},{"text":"Im larping as KGB secret agent.

Its cheaper to produce in China because workers rights are not protected. People save money at the expense of the workers. Ideally workers rights should be enforced and protected everywhere but since we cant enforce that the least we can do is reduce the finical incentive to exploit workers. There is also a potential for reducing income tax by increasing tax revenue from tariffs. Abortion ban. Trump has never spoken in support of a national abortion ban his stance is that it should be up to the states. Which is how it is now, if democrats could change that why didnt they during this Biden Harris term? Less government spending to reduce inflation. This is one of the main differences between conservatives and liberals both stances are valid. At the end of the day the differences in opinion stem from differences in values.

A dictator or monarch could truly wish the best for its citizens, and be competent enough to do so successfully. Autocracy on its own is not tyranny, but it makes tyranny possible and likely.  There are two things however that make a Democracy preferable. 1.) While a dictator or monarch could be benevolent, there is no incentive outside of his/her own benevolence to make the as such, and if you get an incompetent or a malicious autocrat, changing them out is difficult. A leader that fails to produce good results in a Democracy is much easier to remove - either through violence or waiting for them to die, or be removed by the next rung down. Humans are self interested creatures, and dictators are motivated to keep power all costs. Democracy means a leader who wants to keep power must be in the peoples good graces. 2.) Democracy makes the people the author of their own successes and failures. If an autocrat fails the peole, the people bear no responsibility for the autocrats failure. If the autocrat creates a perfect utopia, the people also bear no responsibility for the autocrats success. In the former, the failed autocrat may be overthrown - but will his/her successor learn the lesson? Doubtfully. Mubarak of Egypt was a terrible dictator, and was overthrown. When Morsi was overthrown and the democratic experiment ended, Sisi came to power, and instituted laws that were meant to entrench his power, not to produce good results. This is anecdotal, but there is a view in Egypt that if you spoke against Mubarak, hed throw you in jail for a night, and then let you go. Speak against Sisi and youll disappear. On the other hand, a dictator that produces good results causes the people to buy into the dictatorship. The next ruler, who maybe incompetent or oppressive, can use that goodwill to introduce tyranny. In a democracy, if the government fails, its because the people failed to pick good leaders. If the government succeeds, the people picked good leaders. I am very anti-Trump, and I find that America has for the past 12 years failed to pick good leaders. But 12 years is nothing compared to a dictator who might rule for 30, 40, 50 years. To put it another way - in an ideal world, where people always fulfill their responsibilities, act with a moral compass, and are competent, a dictatorship is the perfect form of government. a dictatorship in such a world is perfect because it does not have the competency falls of Monarchy. In such a world I would want a dictatorship of the competent - a technocracy so to speak. But we dont live in this world. We live in a world of power hungry, selfish, incompetent and deeply stupid people. Democracy makes those people decide, but they at the very least think hard about who they want to make the decisions. A dictatorship means that it is very likely that one of those power hungry, selfish, incompetent and deeply stupid people will likely be in charge for a long, long time. At least in a democracy, when you elect such a person, you can oust him next time the elections come.To put it in a simple sense - if I voluntarily enter a gladiatorial ring, at the risk of death, I consent to do so, and while there are moral issues with a fight to the death gladiatorial ring in of itself, both I and my opponent consent to being killed by the other. Now, if I am forced into the ring with an opponent by a third party, and told to fight to the death, this is morally worse, because I did not consent to being killed, nor did my opponent, nor did either of us consent to killing.Lastly, its important to understand the alternative to popular consent - force of arms. People may consent to a benevolent dictator, but such a system must be held in place by some sort of coercive force no matter how benevolent it is. Power does not by definition make for good ideas, and good ideas may not have the firepower to enforce its ideas. But in a democracy, anyone can be convinced or manipulated depending on your view. Even in cases of pure manipulation, bad ideas can only sustain themselves so long under a system of popular consent, and while good ideas may be similarly short lived, people in a democracy, because they are the authors of their own successes and failures, are directly incentivized to be more politically aware of what is being done to them. Stupid people living in a democracy are smarter than stupid people living under a dictatorship, and except in the most benevolent of dictatorships, smart people are dumber under a dictatorship than smart people living under a democracy, because subjects of a dictatorship bear no responsibility for the act of government.","title":"CMV: There is nothing inherently good about democracy"},{"text":"You really think thatll happen under the incoming administration?

It refers to Article V conventions, where 2/3rds of states can call for a constitutional convention, whose results would require 3/4 of states to ratify. There have been hundreds of attempts at this in the past but every time it has come close to succeeding, congress intervened to initiate the process the other way, which is 2/3s of both houses of congress proposing an amendment, which can then be ratified by 3/4 of the states. An Article V convention would have more power to drastically change the constitution, but despite what the website claims, the convention would indeed be accountable to voters since it would have to be ratified by 3/4 of state legislatures, which would preclude them from being able to pass anything massive in the unlikely event that the process even got to that stage. They also claim that 28 states have called for a convention but thats combining multiple initiatives efforts, and seems to include states where the legislation has been proposed but not passed.TL;DR: there are probably much more pressing things to worry about, including much more likely to be enacted actions by the incoming administration to dismantle democracy.

I know of people who have made the argument that Democrats either ignore or neglect men, and have brought up different bits of messaging or an official campaign page (I need to find this) where there are sections speaking about pretty much every group except men (or white men). Their argument is that it's less about hating men, and more about just not sparing them a thought. 2. As a straight, cis dude, I get mad at the arguments people make about either downplaying or completing abandoning those rights, especially the arguments this past week about abandoning trans rights. Never been a fan of throwing marginalized groups to the wolves. These folks making the arguments tend to directly or indirectly imply the same for black people too, and outside of being morally messed up, I feel like it's crappy strategy. Maybe the argument of sidestepping the topics in red/swing states could've had merit awhile back, but I think after Dobbs and with all this culture war stuff happening, it's better to just attack it head on. 3. I always try to go with the logical argument, with the full understanding that this probs doesn't work on a lot of MAGA people. Different groups having rights is pretty great for men too. More people and perspectives to learn from in the workplace, happier people in our personal lives, etc. There's an empathy argument to be made in day to day life too. People are less likely to hold onto these beliefs when they know folks from these group. As far as an in-person strategy: Whenever someone starts acting up about this stuff, I usually just cock my head to the side and ask them why they're upset.

President Barack Obama has often been referred to by immigration groups as the \\"Deporter in Chief.\\" Between 2009 and 2015 his administration has removed more than 2.5 million people through immigration orders, which doesnt include the number of people who \\"self-deported\\" or were turned away and/or returned to their home country at the border by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).According to?[governmental data](https://www.dhs.gov/yearbook-immigration-statistics), the Obama administration has deported more people than any other president's administration in history.In fact, they have deported more than the sum of all the presidents of the 20th century.President George W. Bush's administration deported just over two million during his time in office; and Obamas numbers dont reflect his last year in office, for which data is not yet available.Repealing birth right citizenship, im on the fence personally where i stand on it.

The leaders of the movement clearly positioned themselves as Europeans creating an outpost of Europe in the Middle East. Only after European Jews had created the state of Israel was there a large influx of Mizrahi Jews. So it really makes the most sense to understand Zionism as a European colonial nationalist movement created by Jews who were not indigenous to the middle east that subsequently incorporated (and was accepted by) Mizrahi jews who were indigenous to the middle east. [...] Even early zionists would not have agreed with that. It's an idea that has only gained steam in service of the legitimation of Zionism in a world that opposes colonialism.They positioned themselves as European *Jews*, and clearly regarded modern-day Israel as their ancestral homeland. While he did consider other locations because of practical considerations, he wrote of Palestine as \\"our unforgettable historic homeland\\" and of all Jews worldwide as \\"a people  one people\\" already his 1896's *Judenstaat* manifesto. No other \\"colonisation\\" movement considered themselves as recovering their lost homeland. Jews are indigenous indigenous to historical Palestine, because that is where their ethnogenesis happened, and where they last had sovereignty. Does a family of Native American who settle down in Europe stop being indigenous to the U.S.A.? Or are you disputing that Iranian Jews or Ashkenazi Jews are descendants from Jews who lived in modern-day Israel? Because there is really no doubt about it, according to genetic and historical studies. For example (quoting from Wiki),*The estimated cumulative total male genetic admixture amongst Ashkenazim was, according to Hammer et al., \\"very similar to Motulsky's average estimate of 12.5%. This could be the result, for example, of \\"as little as 0.5% per generation, over an estimated 80 generations\\", according to Hammer et al. Such figures indicated that there had been a \\"relatively minor contribution\\" to Ashkenazi paternal lineages by converts to Judaism and non-Jews**Hammer et al. add that Diaspora Jews from Europe, Northwest Africa, and the Near East resemble each other more closely than they resemble their non-Jewish neighbors.\\"**Two studies by Nebel et al. in 2001 and 2005, based on Y chromosome polymorphic markers, suggested that Ashkenazi Jews are more closely related to other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than they are to their host populations in Europe (defined in the using Eastern European, German, and French Rhine Valley populations).**[Feder et al.] also found that the differences between the Jewish communities can be overlooked when non-Jews are included in the comparisons.\\" It supported previous interpretations that, in the direct maternal line, there was \\"little or no gene flow from the local non-Jewish communities in Poland and Russia to the Jewish communities in these countries.\\"* For example, the distinction between Jews and Christians was something that developed over centuries. At the beginning, Christians were just a Jewish group. That's because Christians are not an *ethnic* group and never were one. Christianity spread through proselytisation and mass-scale conversion, whereas Jews managed to maintain their in-group status.","title":"CMV: Zionism is no different from other successful national movements"},{"text":"Even if we had offered solutions, would it have mattered?

Other than the fact that over 50% of Israeli Jews are Mizrahim, whose parents were expelled from the Arab states, all evidence points to genetic similarity between all major Jewish groups. The Zionist movement was created by Ashkenazi Jews who were from Europe and largely viewed themselves as European. The leaders of the movement clearly positioned themselves as Europeans creating an outpost of Europe in the Middle East. Only after European Jews had created the state of Israel was there a large influx of Mizrahi Jews. So it really makes the most sense to understand Zionism as a European colonial nationalist movement created by Jews who were not indigenous to the middle east that subsequently incorporated (and was accepted by) Mizrahi jews who were indigenous to the middle east.Also, saying that Jews are indigenous to the Middle East is quite a different thing from saying that they are indigenous to historical Palestine. There has been a small population of Jews in Palestine for millenia, and no one would argue that they aren't indigenous. That's quite a different thing from arguing that Ashkenazi Jews or Iranian Jews are indigenous to Palestine, especially given that the idea that all Jews are indigenous to Palestine is a very modern concept that Jews from outside of Palestine would not have agreed with 100 or 200 years ago. Even early zionists would not have agreed with that. It's an idea that has only gained steam in service of the legitimation of Zionism in a world that opposes colonialism. Another thing to note is that, much like self-determination is a collective right, indigeneity as a concept applies to entire ethnic groups, rather than individuals. Indigenous peoples are inheritors and practitioners of unique cultures and ways of relating to people and the environment, and in the case of Jews, there is a unique indigenous culture that spans millenia. Note that I am not denying that the Palestinian Arab and, more broadly, Levantine Arab culture has become indigenous too.But this approach to indigeneity doesn't make much sense. First, ethnic groupings are constantly in flux. The Jewish ethnoreligious category has only recently become a cohesive group. It has subsumed a wide range of different ethnic groups with shared or related religious traditions that existed as distinct categories with limited interactions with each other for centuries. Some of those groups would have considered themselves indigenous to Palestine (probably the ones that lived there), others would not have. Ethnic identity is something that evolves over time and is not a static property of specific individuals or groups of individuals and their descendants. If we were to accept your definition of indigeneity, Indigenous groups would constantly expand and contract as the way people identified changed. For example, the distinction between Jews and Christians was something that developed over centuries. At the beginning, Christians were just a Jewish group. At the end, Christians were viewed as completely non-jewish. Today we have a certain concept of who is Jewish and what it means to be Jewish. 100 years ago, that concept was different, and in 100 years, we may have a very different concept. If that concept includes a large number of people who are currently not considered Jews, will those new individuals suddenly be indigenous to Palestine/Israel and have a claim to live on the land there?Second, it doesn't make much sense to consider groups indigenous because they are \\"inheritors and practitioners of unique cultures and ways of relating to people and the environment.\\" There is no group of people today that has the same culture as Jews or Israelites from Millenia ago. Modern jews practice their religion very differently from ancient Jews - Rabbinic Judaism came into existence less than 2000 years ago. If we start talking about \\"inheritors\\" of the Jewish religious tradition, but allow for evolution in that tradition, why don't we also consider Christians and Muslims inheritors of ancient Judaism? They no longer share the same name, but they are no less evolutions of the Jewish cultural traditions from 2000 years ago. Even if we consider modern Jewish people alone, that category includes multiple groups with unique cultures and traditions that have elements that originated both in Palestine and outside of Palestine. For example, Ethiopian Jews have a very different practice of Judaism from mainstream rabbinic Judaism, which itself is distinct from the Judaism that was practiced by the original Israelites.","title":"CMV: Zionism is no different from other successful national movements"},{"text":"Dont worry, the party of small government will surely be on the case to repeal this law.","title":"Texas still has a law banning gay sex.

They were indeed the majority there. What percentage of the *overall* Mandate's territory they owned is irrelevant. Would you argue that the Finnish, Estonians, or Latvians shouldnt have separated from the Russian Empire, because they owned a small portion of the Russian Empire? Or that the Czechs and Poles should have remained persecuted minorities in the German Empire?   Jews were not denied the Algerian citizenship at independence in 1962, Jews CHOSE to keep the French citizenship they had been granted almost a century before that.Wrong. The Nationality Code of 1963 restricted nationality to persons who had two paternal ancestral lines which had \\"Muslim status\\" in Algeria. Jews and other minorities were excluded. It also limited those who could naturalize to persons who had \\"participated in the struggle for independence\\", which is a subjective criterion and was used to arbitrarily deny citizenship. And you cant just dismiss a strong argument by just saying \\"its questionable\\". The dispute over the Baghdad bombings is beside the point, but, sure, we could discuss it. By the time they occurred, over 100K Iraqi Jews had already left and registered to leave. The Prime Minister of Iraq, Nuri al-Said, actually warned the Jews in Baghdad, many of whom had to flee pogroms in the country's periphery, to hasten their departure, lest he takes them to the border \\"himself\\". He had also talked to the British ambassador of his plans to place place Jews in armored cars and force them across the border.By 1950 Jewish residents were routinely pelted with stones or receiving death threats from their neighbors. In September 1948, the only Jewish Iraqi Senator delivered a long speech enumerating the mounting discrimination, harassment, and extortion. By late 1949 the American embassy reported on the widespread fear of the Jewish community and speculating that 100,000 jews would be forced to leave Iraq. All of this happened *before* the bombings.In light of this, there was no sense for the Zionist Agency to place the bombs, especially given that at that time they were struggling with accommodating thousands of new refugees and actually petitioned to al-Said to extend the deadline for the Jews' departure.

I think you are exactly right. The first stimulus package was at least defensible at the time (compared to the later inaction), given the ongoing pandemic. Decisive fiscal action is responsible for a lot of the post pandemic growth we've seen. Less defensible is the relative inaction after it became clear that inflation was here. The inflation reduction act was an absolute joke when it came to actual inflation reduction. It was just another big fiscal spending stimulus bill. Sure there was a green energy package and some supply chain items, but the lead time on every single item was so long; none of it would actually address short term inflationary pressures.

The Democrats have an incredibly powerful platform with a lot of reach. Their issue is not that people aren't hearing them.

Originally, I'd planned to talk about this later, but The Discourse has made it necessary to discuss now.  I've seen it all over the Internet, including this very subreddit, and we've got to talk about it once and for all.  Because until we do, we won't make any significant progress on understanding bias against women in politics.**So what's the big lie?**I'll get straight to the point: The idea I've seen bouncing around recently has been that *Trump's win is really the Dems' fault, because they spout such hatred and indifference towards men, and Trump offered them the kindness and understanding Dems refused to give them.*It's bullshit.This lie has taken kinder forms, too.  Maybe Dems just need to toss the radical feminists out of the party.  Maybe they just need to center male figures.  Maybe if Harris had just gone on Joe Rogan (he's so cool!), it'd have all been OK.  But those are just nicer versions of the same lie.  And we need to understand that it's a lie if we are going to make any worthwhile changes in light of the last election - and avoid harmful changes.**Hearing them out**[This article lays out the big lie pretty well.](https://www.glamour.com/story/why-did-young-men-vote-for-donald-trump)  You can find it in a lot of pundit and Redditor commentary, too, but the article makes the same points in one convenient place.So, what's it say?  It has lots of examples of men feeling like Harris and Democrats hate them.  But did you notice what that article *didn't* include?  **Literally any specific examples.**Im a straight white man, and I feel like we take the blame for a lot of things, Sumners says.From *who?*  *Who* is saying this?The people Ive spoken to who voted for Harris are constantly saying that were racist, that were misogynistic, that, you know, were transphobic.\\"*Name one.* Even just 'my friend', or 'my roommate', or whoever.??I feel like theres this cultural frustration that young men have that theyre not allowed to be young men, says 26-year-old Benji Backer from Arizona.*Who is saying this?* Just one link, and I'll shut up, I swear. I have always prioritized that in everything that I do, and so it doesnt feel good to feel like Im being blamed. I get told all the time, Youre a white man, sit down and wait your turn...\\"*Name literally one person telling you this.*  If it's happening to you all the time, surely you can point to someone!  You can't even name someone in your own life saying it, so I highly doubt Kamala Harris said it at any point!I'll stop here, but read the whole thing yourself, and look for even one real-world example.  You won't find one.  Go read another article, or posts about this on Reddit and elsewhere.  Many people *claiming* there's this epidemic of people hating men, but no one actually *showing* it.**Being fair to these guys**I'll pause for a second to say that I'm aware men do face challenges.  Mental health, loneliness, economic opportunity.  Women face these issues as well, but I know men feel them acutely - they do play into masculine fragility, after all.The point is, men do face challenges.  And who had a plan for that?  [Kamala](https://kamalaharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/FMfcgzQXJZxzLGgcKmSNQSXCRKXShwxJ.pdf) fucking [Harris.](https://kamalaharris.com/adelante/)So yes, men do have valid concerns.  And Harris had answers.  But it wasn't about answers.  It was about this idea that Harris/Democrats/somebody hates men.I think this lie comes from a really weak source.**\\"If liberals don't hate men, then why do I keep saying they do?\\"**It comes down to a cycle:1. Find someone, somewhere, saying something that sounds like 'I hate men'.  Could be from a teenager, or someone with three followers, or even from a 4chan troll - it doesn't matter!2. Let the online trolls post and repost it, getting into a rage about it.3. Small-time misogynist bloggers and podcasters talk about the 'controversy'.4. The big-timers pick it up, and make it about politics.  Now Kamala Harris is tied to this random account she's failed to denounce, because she's busy trying to make life better for men.  (And if you're wondering why some GOP Reps and Senators are so online, this is why.  Fuel for the fire).Basically: **If you want to say women deserve rights, many men now believe that you hate all men, because of this lengthy smear campaign.**  The manosphere's integration into the GOP, plus Dems rightly fighting for womens' and LGBT+ rights, has made this even tougher.I've alluded to the fact that when I was younger, I nearly got sucked into all this stuff.  The gateway drug for me was a now-banned subreddit called TumblrInAction.  They'd find 'hilarious' posts on Tumblr about feminism gone too far, disregarding that many of them were by literal teenagers or admitted trolls.  Then the comment sections got into a frothing rage, which escaped to the rest of Reddit.  Before long \\"Did you just assume my gender?\\" and \\"Wow, check your privilege!\\" were top-tier Reddit memes, when they started on some blog with no followers.  And now a lot of guys who grew up on Reddit think that's what it means to care about women's rights.Want a more real-world example?  Look at [the sad story of Chanty Binx](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/people/big-red), better known as 'Big Red'.  She was one random feminist telling off misogynists, and the manosphere turned her into the evil, shrill face of women's rights.  (By the way, that only happens if a lot of guys secretly suspect that about women, and feel like there's value in sharing it).  Now if Democrats want to stand up for women, they get associated with an angry face.  Never mind that Binx's points were valid; it's all about the meme to these guys.**So, what now?**Well, this is a hard one!  You can't make everyone stop saying things that make men uncomfortable forever, and even if you somehow did, they'd use anonymous troll accounts to do the same thing.  Or just replay the classics.  I *still* see Binx's face posted by trolls years later.The idea is out there, and there's not much that can be done about it.  And no, better messaging won't solve it; [in fact, online figures pushing back on sexism often makes it worse thanks to male fragility.](https://lithub.com/how-many-ways-can-men-say-not-all-men/)  (And yes, that article is hard on men, but check the context - a woman venting her frustrations at trying to talk about sexism and being shouted down by men.  She's not talking to you).And I hope it goes without saying: The solution isn't to downplay women's rights or throw anyone out of the party.  We want to change these bigoted forces, not let them win.But an important idea has come out of our first two talks.  So many of us avoided falling for sexist nonsense due to our relationships with others.  That kept me from falling in.  It also keeps the other guys in our lives from getting snared.  **When men see with their own eyes that people care about them, it's much harder to fall for the 'liberals hate men' lie.**  Maybe they'll even see all the work Democrats are doing to make their lives better.The Big Lie of 2024 is that Democrats hate men, and that we need to listen to Republican lies to prove that we don't.  But if we do that, we'd be abandoning *everyone*, including men.  We'd be saying that comforting lies are more important than actually helping them.  We'd be holding up the system of masculine fragility that keeps guys from getting the support they need, and makes them think that hate is the answer to their economic situation.  And we'd be sending one hell of a terrible message to women, that if Republicans are hateful enough we'll listen to them.  It's even more dangerous than lies about a stolen election, because it traps everyone.Now you know the truth.  Tell it widely.**Questions to consider**1. Have you ever had anyone try to argue to you that Democrats hate men?  Did they offer any attempts at proof?2. When people suggest downplaying women's rights (or LGBT+ rights, which are closely intertwined), how does that make you feel?3. We've talked about the value in real-life relationships.  How else could individual people help combat the idea that standing for women's rights means you hate men?  (Note that I'm most interested in ideas that we, as individuals, could do.)4.

Let's consider the definition: Indigenous communities, peoples and nations are those which, *having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories*, and may consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the societies now prevailing on those territories, or parts of them.Jews retained the culture and national self-identification that existed before the Roman/Ottoman/Arab colonialism, whereas Palestinian Arabs (to a large extent) did not. Even the First Palestinian Arab Congress declared: *\\"We consider Palestine nothing but part of Arab Syria and it has never been separated from it at any stage. We are tied to it by national, religious, linguistic, moral, economic, and geographic bounds.\\"*Note that I don't dispute that a Palestinian national movement that is indigenous to the Levant has emerged by now. I'm only saying that attempts to deny that Jews are indigenous too are incorrect.Your point regarding food is very superficial.

But you forget to mention that the reality for Palestinians isn't the same as the reality Sudeten, Silesian or Prussian Germans faced. There are no permanent Sudeten refugee camps, they are nominally free to move back, they don't live under martial law or any type of occupation.That's because, while the Sudeten Germans were incorportated into the German nation, the surrounding Arab nations denied Palestinians this opportunity. The Arab League passed Resolution 1547, explicitly instructed its member states not to give Palestinians citizenship, in order to avoid dissolution of their identity and protect their rights to return to their homeland. That is why the refugee camps still exist generations later.I'm not denying that the Palestinian national movement doesn't exist *now*, but Palestinian Arabs didn't consider themselves a separate ethnic group at first. Quoting from the First Palestinian Arab Congress: *\\"We consider Palestine nothing but part of Arab Syria and it has never been separated from it at any stage. We are tied to it by national, religious, linguistic, moral, economic, and geographic bounds.\\"* I don't see why the Sudeten Germans wouldn't have emerged as a distinct ethnicity either under these conditions.

Properly used, indigenous doesnt mean had an ethnogenesis somewhere it means was colonised, or is under threat of colonisation. indigeneity isnt something that exists in a vacuum independent of colonialism; the French arent indigenous to France, Bretons are.Good point! However, Jews *did* undergo an ethnogenesis in modern-day Israel, and were colonised: first by the Romans, and then by the Arabs and Ottomans. The fact that they weren't expelled doesn't change that fact.

Especially for conventional first strike (see Conventional Prompt Strike initiative) Not land-based missile attacks from US soil. In an offensive war these would take time to setup, and like in our recent conflicts, we would try to destroy radar, air defenses, strategic ground targets, etc. before we bring in the bulk of ground forces. The ATACMS only has 300km range from what I can tell. Not very useful from US soil. Maybe useful in certain bases world-wide or in FOBs depending on the exact conflict we may face. Ballistic missiles are also easier to shoot down due to trajectory compared to something like a low-altitude cruise missile.Nuclear weapons are an entirely different story. We have lots of ground-based ICBMs for deterrence. Pretty old &amp; arguably outdated, but power in numbers, especially with MIRV warheads. But, 2/3 of the nuclear triad is the air and sea components for shorter-range surprise attacks that are less likely to be detected &amp; intercepted.

The British certainly published the Balfour Declaration and permitted Jewish immigration in the 1920s, but the Russians actively organized Armenians resettlement. The right parallel to the Russian resettlement of Armenians would be the Turkish settlement of Turks in occupied Northern Cyprus where the Turkish government literally paid, bussed, and shipped Turkish peasants to live on Cyprus. It was an organized migration, not a permissive standard. Additionally, after the Palestinian Civil War of 1936-1939, the British prevented Jewish migration to Palestine under the White Paper of 1939, leading Ben-Gurion to famously say, \\"We shall fight the War as if there was no White Paper, and the White Paper, as if there was no War.\\"\\\\ I agree that their primary focus was a state in West Armenia, but that's not because they didn't consider East Armenia a part of that state. They simply viewed Russians as an ally against the Ottoman Empire and didn't want to antagonize them.This is true.\\\\ ...sources like Wikipedia indicate that the Armenian national movement was already at play in the 1860s.?There were Armenians who wanted more rights as early as the 1860s, like the Armenians who would become part of the Ottoman Parliament of 1876, but without a unified standard, it didn't mean much. The Dashnaks and Hunchaks provided such a standard.

Its members have been called snowflakes, mocked for performative slacktivism and embracing trigger warnings, and described (favorably and unfavorably) as climate warriors and gun-control activists. Some older commentators have even proclaimed them the nationslast hope. (The number of people whove argued that Gen Z might save the world is  not small.)But that progressive reputation was called into question when Donald Trump won last weeks presidential electionpartly thanks, it seems, to Gen Z, which encompasses voters ages 18 to 27. Exit polls and county-by-county analyses, however imprecise, indicated that young voters had shifted right since 2020. Thats especially true for young menmost of all young white men, who made up one of Trumps most supportive cohorts. Democrats also lost ground with young women, though. According to some national exit-poll data, the partys lead among 18-to-29-year-olds was cut nearly in half. And county data (which are considered more reliable, though still imperfect) indicate that counties with large populations of 18-to-34-year-olds moved 5.6 points rightward since the 2020 election.People had good reason for thinking that more young adults might vote for Kamala Harris. Surveys have shown that the group cares about blue-coded issues such as the environment, firearm safety, diversity, and inclusivity. One 2023 poll found that, compared with Baby Boomers and Generation X, Gen Z is more concerned about criminal-justice reform and racial equity; in 2020, Pew found that Gen Z members are likelier to say the government should do more to solve problems rather than leaving things to business and individuals.But, as researchers told me, priorities change; young adults can care about progressive causes and still be moved by messaging that speaks to their deep unease and uncertainty. Many of them are strugglingto feel financially secure, psychologically safe, or hopeful. Trump, in his campaign, managed to mirror what many young people already felt: The world is a frightening place, and its not getting better.So what nerve did Trump hit? One common thread preoccupying many young people, Grace told me, is a desire for security. When you think about things like their passion for the environment, desire for school safety, financial success, affordable housing, she said, all of those things have the same spin on them: I just want to feel safe. They generally want to go to class without worrying about shooters, to grow older without witnessing the planets demise, to pay rent without draining their whole paycheck, to believe they can make ends meet. Trump campaigned on fearhe warned of an economy in shambles, crime and danger lurking, undocumented immigrants taking work from forgotten men and women. Much of that wasnt rooted in reality: Violent crime rates are down in the U.S., for instance, and undocumented immigrants tend to fill jobs that American workers say they dont want. Still, fear resonated.But another person who might have nudged Gen Z rightward is Kamala Harris. The vice presidents campaign hardly mentioned climate change or gun controlissues which, though theyve dropped in importance for young voters more recently, might still have been unifying across race and gender if theyd been highlighted, both Grace and Seemiller told me. Harris did talk about some economic policies, such as lowering housing costs and instituting a price-gouging ban. But she also hammered home that shed save Americaand democracyfrom Trump, and piece together the norms he shattered. That wouldnt necessarily have resonated with Gen Z, the oldest of whom were only 21 when Trump was first elected in 2016, the researchers I spoke with told me; a world with Trump is the only world theyve really known as adults. In Seemiller and Graces 2021 survey, access to voting and political dysfunction were pretty low on the priority list. They might not have been hearing the issue that mattered to them, Grace told me. And so it really had to be simplified down to: Do I care about the economy or do I care about this other thing theyre talking about?","title":"The Not-So-Woke Generation Z - The same young people once derided as liberal snowflakes are moving to the right."},{"text":"Section 19 of her sf86 looks like a Russian phone book","title":"Top House Democrat: Gabbard a national security threat to US"},{"text":"The trans issue became a losing political issue the moment \\"trans women are women\\" went mainstream and every Democratic Party politician echoed it without pushback or nuance.","title":"Kamala is for they-them  Trumps trans attacks have Democrats fighting each other"},{"text":"Putin makes them wet the bed.","title":"MAGA Patriots are losing whats left of their minds over Bidens authorization."},{"text":"I just didnt know enough about her PoLiCiEs.","title":"You thought inflation was bad under Biden?"},{"text":"On the issue of unnneeded, superfluous wars that I do agree upon.

It was not an attempt by Armenians to create a national state; Armenian nationalism did not really come to the fore until the founding of the Dashnaktsutyun Party over 50 years after these resettlements largely took place AND we should be clear that the Dashnaks were primarily oriented towards creating an Armenian State in West Armenia (modern Turkey) because Russia was sponsoring them, so they would not want to directly threaten Russia.I'm not sure if that's entirely true, as sources like Wikipedia indicate that the Armenian national movement was already at play in the 1860s. I agree that their primary focus was a state in West Armenia, but that's not because they didn't consider East Armenia a part of that state. They simply viewed Russians as an ally against the Ottoman Empire and didn't want to antagonize them.

Democrats were long considered by many Americans to be the party of the common man and woman. Mark Brewer, of the University of Maine, has found that in every presidential election between 1952 and 2004, the trait voters said they most liked about the Democrats was that they were the party of the working class. By contrast, the biggest mark against the Republicans was that they were viewed as the party of big business and the upper class.These perceptions created a clear divide between the parties coalitions during that period: Democrats were likelier to win lower-educated and lower-income voters while Republicans were the favored party of many college-educated and affluent Americans.At the same time, the parties had also begun to polarize along racial lines. Following the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and 1965 Voting Rights Act under President Lyndon Johnson, black Americans almost uniformly threw their weight behind Democrats while white votersespecially white southernersbegan moving toward Republicans. For a time, this came at the expense of the Democrats: from 1968 through 1988, they won the presidency just once, in 1976.However, by the 1990s, the country was growing more diverse and better educated. Bill Clinton was a beneficiary of this new reality, as he made sweeping gains with women, young people, voters of color (specifically, Hispanics), and college-educated voters. Importantly, he also retained significant support from white Americans and lower-educated voters, who made up the vast majority of the electorate. As Clinton rode this coalition to victory twicemarking the first time since FDR that a Democrat had won two full terms as presidentsome political observers saw the emergence of a new majority, one that could consistently win elections using the formula Clinton had used.In 2008, Barack Obama built on the Clinton coalition, bringing in even higher levels of support from almost every major party constituency, including blacks, Hispanics, Asians, young people, and women.1 But that year saw the rise of another trend as well: Obama became the first Democratic nominee since at least 1988 to decisively win voters who held a bachelors degree. He also fared far better with high-income earners than past Democrats had. These were the first signs of a growing professional class whose cultural values had aligned many of them with Team Bluea departure from the past.Obamas two wins led Democrats and Republicans alike to believe in the emerging Democratic majority thesis. Gone were the days when Democrats needed to win a majority of white voters, a feat they had found nearly impossible to achieve since the 1960s. Now, the party that represented Americas demographic future stood to lead it as well.But no sooner did that consensus emerge than Donald Trump arrived on the scene. Trump disrupted the Democrats plans for building a dominant coalition and, in the process, helped precipitate a dramatic realignment between the two partiesone rooted in economic and social class. This change has tipped the demographic advantage in favor of Republicans and left Democrats at very real risk of losing many of the voters who not long ago were expected to deliver them a permanent majority.**In 2016, non-college-educated voters, a group that had backed Obama by four points in 2012, swung to Trump, who won them by six.** This was a core driver of Trumps win, as these voters made up a whopping 63 percent of the electorate that year. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton gained substantial ground with college graduates, who went from also backing Obama by four points to supporting her by 15. This was an early sign that Democrats would struggle to win without a critical mass of working-class voters behind them.Four years later, as Joe Biden defeated Trump, the education gap grew even wider. Biden improved on Clintons advantage with college-educated voters by three more points, while Trumps margin with non-college voters remained virtually unchangedlikely the difference in the outcome. Even in Bidens victory, though, there were signs that the traditional Democratic coalition wasnt holding. The clearest example was the rightward swing of Hispanic voters, who had backed Clinton by 38 points but supported Biden by only 26. There were also more modest signs of eroding support among black and Asian voters. In fact, a key driver of Bidens win was improvements with white Americans: he lost them to Trump by only 13 points compared to Clintons 17-point deficit.It seems plausible that because Democrats found success in 2020 and unexpectedly did so again in the 2022 midterms, they overlooked real problems under the hood of their coalition. Now, these problems finally caught up with them.Initial data from the 2024 AP VoteCast survey shows that Kamala Harris matched Bidens margin with white voters, but Trump made historic gains with non-white voters. He earned the highest share of Asian support since 2004, the highest share of black support since 1976, and the second-highest share of Hispanic support ever (he even nearly won Hispanic men outright). All this points to an American electorate that is becoming less polarized along racial and ethnic lines. While that may be a welcome development for society, it comes at the obvious expense of the Democrats, who had hoped these voting blocs would help them build a demographically dominant coalition for years to come.Meanwhile, the transformation of the parties along class lines appears to be moving full steam ahead. Harris came close to matching Bidens level of support among college-educated voters, winning them by 14 points. But perhaps just as telling: she carried voters earning at least $100,000 by seven pointsby far the largest margin for a Democratic nominee in the modern era. On the other side, Trump became the first Republican nominee on record to win low-income voters, narrowly carrying them by three points. He also continued growing his advantage with non-college voters, winning them by 13 pointsthe largest margin for the GOP since at least 1988. And his 44 percent support from union households marked the greatest share for a Republican since Ronald Reagan.Looking at this picture, its hard not to see that the Democrats have now become the party of the very thing they have long fought against: the elites. This stands in sharp contrast to their longtime image as the party of the working class, which is further and further in the rearview mirror. According to political scientist Matt Grossmann, college-educated white voters this year became a plurality of the Democratic coalition for the first time ever, surpassing both non-college whites as well as voters of color.On a more practical note, this new coalition also risks putting the Democrats on electorally unsound footing. Although college graduates are more reliable voters than their non-college peers, they also constitute a much smaller share of the population. Without a meaningful share of working-class voters in the mix, the party will struggle to be competitive.Strategists and pundits will argue in the months ahead about the best path forward for the Democrats, but suffice it to say: from both an electoral and moral standpoint, the partys aim should be to return to its roots as the party of the people.","title":"\\"In every presidential election between 1952 and 2004, the trait voters said they most liked about the Democrats was that they were the party of the working class.

For example, lets say if you go into trades, or engineering, or IT, you get a good job.. but if you go into Arts, or Psci, history, the majority of the time you DONT get a job, then that means the market does not monetarily value those jobs and having to repay debt for that decision would then sway others (and you) from making the same decision again in the future. This shifts the workforce towards things that provide MORE value for the economy.\\n2. its unethical. Why should i or my kids (who did research on the job market and hence took education / career paths that provide jobs that pay a good wage) pay for people who didnt finsih school or took classes in something that didnt have a job market waiting for them. why should i pay for someones hobby? people takee 4 years of art classes knowing that this would be a hobby for them since the chance to make money at is is almost zero, yet the tax payer has to cover that?

Interest rates on housing loans depend on the health of the economy. Interest rate increases always cause increases in rent, and it compounds because most corporate rental companies base the charges on percentages, so an increase in base costs causes an even larger increase in rent. So if the company is charging a 30% profit margin on a $1,000 per month mortgage, then the rent would be $1,300, a $300 increase. If the same company charges the same 30% but the mortgage is $1,500, then the rent will be $1,950, a $450 increase.Google \\"What influences home loan interest rates?\\"","title":"You thought inflation was bad under Biden?"},{"text":"So, again, he's weak, empty threats, *and* a war monger who will cause world war III.","title":"\\nAlex Jones @RealAlexJones - BREAKING: Vladimir Putin Says Russia Now 'At War' With NATO After Biden Confirms Long Range Missile Restrictions Have Been Lifted.

One argument for democracy is that it provides laws with legitimacy. Why would people feel bound to laws that they have no control over? We don't live in times in which people will just automatically accept the authority of monarchs, priests or scientists anymore. If people don't respect those kinds of authority anymore, the only thing that can move people to obey the laws is that by voting they consented to the laws.Another argument that you seem to miss is that policy is not just about coming to empirically correct and scientifically valid results. People have subjective preferences and values that inform their votes. As mentioned in background, this makes sense to people when it comes to something scientific (like mask mandates), but why not in other areas of government?  \\n  That illustrates part of the problem with your argument. Even mask mandates imposed by experts were illegitimate. Sure, to what extent masks work and in which contexts they work is a scientific question, but whenever we talk about mandating something the issue is political and based on personal values and moral convictions of voters.","title":"CMV: There is nothing inherently good about democracy"},{"text":"One thing is for sure.....ONLY THE DEAD SEE THE END OF WAR","title":"World War 3?"},{"text":"??

Because this article, like the Axios one posted last week, also cites the SF Fed paper:\\n?Fiscal stimulus, approved by both Trump and Biden, accounted for about 3 percentage points of the rise in inflation through 2021, according to the San Francisco Fed.?\\nIt doesn't provide an actual citation, but I'm sure they are referencing this one, which is from March 2022:\\nhttps://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2022/03/why-is-us-inflation-higher-than-in-other-countries\\nI'm not sure how confidently the SF Fed could determine that fiscal stimulus caused 3% of the inflation increase when we hadn't even reached peak inflation in early 2022. Especially since the Brookings Institute have put out their own set of models and papers in 2024 saying fiscal stimulus had *little* effect on inflation:\\n We use new data to disentangle supply versus demand drivers in COVID-19 inflation.\\n The vast majority of the inflation surge was driven by supply-linked factors, not by the demand side that would point to overheating and excessive policy stimulus.\\n ...\\n?Labor market tightnessand thus excessive policy stimuluslook to have played a minor role.?\\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/articles/covid-19-inflation-was-a-supply-shock/\\nNow, the SF Fed did take another look at margins as a supply-side factor in May 2024:\\n?However, aggregate markupsthe more relevant measure for overall inflationhave stayed essentially flat since the start of the recovery. As such, rising markups have not been a main driver of the recent surge and subsequent decline in inflation during the current recovery.\\nhttps://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2024/05/are-markups-driving-ups-and-downs-of-inflation\\nBut Brookings seemed to have computed margins differently and used other supply-side factors that the SF Fed did not look at.\\nSo really, I just don't know what to believe. Like it makes sense in my head, that if you inject a ton of money into the economy, inflation will go up. But it seems that the science isn't fully parsed and settled yet just how much COVID stimulus contributed to US inflation. Maybe it will never be disentangled.

You seem to be saying it's no less justified than other forms of nationalism. That's a fair bit more specific a claim.

If we compare Zionism to Greek Nationalism, Turkish Nationalism, Bulgarian Nationalism, German Nationalism, and other ethnonationalist movements, there were certainly regions where the given nationality was a minority -- Greeks were a minority in Western Thrace, Bulgarians were a minority in some regions of Eastern Rumelia, and Turks were a minority in Smyrna -- but the overwhelming majority of the territory claimed by these movements (and ultimately subsumed by the resulting ethnonationalist states) did have locally-extant majorities of the named ethnicity.By contrast, Jews had to make a large-scale migration to Ottoman/British Palestine in order to become a sizable population in any part of that territory aside from the city of Jerusalem. Jews had to immigrate in large numbers to push themselves up from being roughly 8% of the Mandate of Palestine population to 35% in 1948. You try to compare this to the Armenification of the Erivan Khanate, but we should note that the Armenians who moved into the Erivan Khanate under Russian control did so because of Russian motivations. The Russians wanted to have a loyal population south of the Caucasus to defend the position from the Persians. The Russians wagered (successfully) that creating an Armenian enclave there would allow the Russians a natural bridgehead and protective line -- especially as the Cossacks were tied up with the Circassians in the Aul-Wars (and later Tsitsekun). It was not an attempt by Armenians to create a national state; Armenian nationalism did not really come to the fore until the founding of the Dashnaktsutyun Party over 50 years after these resettlements largely took place AND we should be clear that the Dashnaks were primarily oriented towards creating an Armenian State in West Armenia (modern Turkey) because Russia was sponsoring them, so they would not want to directly threaten Russia. Dashnaks only really began pushing for Armenian independence in East Armenia (modern Armenia/Georgia/Azerbaijan) when the Russian Civil War broke out, weakening Russian power south of the Caucasus.","title":"CMV: Zionism is no different from other successful national movements"},{"text":"The mythical center just voted him in the office.

Jews constituted 33% of the Mandate's population. They were given 56% of the land, because most of it was the barren Negev desert and the swamps in the North. Most importantly, they were the *majority* in the lands that were alloted to them. Regarding your second point, the evidence for Israel's involvement in the Baghdad bombing is questionable at best. What is uncontroversial is how Jews were treated. When Algeria and Libya got independence, they denied Jews citizenship. In Syria and Iraq, Jewish bank accounts were frozen, their driver's licenses annulled, there were quotas on Jewish employment etc. Jews were also arbitrary arrested, Jewish businesses were seized. In most cases, Jews were eventually expelled and had their property confiscated by the state. If you want to go further back in history, you'll discover how Jews were persecuted under Muslim rule for centuries. You'll also learn about the never-ending anti-Jewish pogroms, which continued well into the 1940s.In any case, your second point doesn't dispute my argument because, at its worst, the formation of other nation-states (e.g. Armenia, Czechia, Poland) was definitely no better than Israel's.","title":"CMV: Zionism is no different from other successful national movements"},{"text":"Im both jealous but have also read youve been importing these beliefs, so seems like that could change?","title":"Oklahoma Superintendent Demands Students Watch Him Pray for Trump"},{"text":"These pundits are completely out of touch too.

They never intended Jews to be there or to have peaceful coexistence, whereas the Jews basically accepted a two state solution (in the form of the UN partition plan) from the very beginning.Others also conveniently ignore the fact that Arabs attacked Jews prior to the formation of Israel, collaborated with Hitler to try to bring the final solution to the Middle East, and were the beneficiaries of the USSR throughout the Cold War (which is basically why we still see a similar alignment to this day with Russia and Iran supporting them, with the US supporting Israel).
