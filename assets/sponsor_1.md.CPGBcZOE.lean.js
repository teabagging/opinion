This unfortunately rings true today more than ever. Many voters aren't making politically informed decisions, they're making *feelings* based decisions. And that's what got Trump elected, feelings.Biden was supposed to be a one term, \\"transitional\\" president from the start. The beginning of a shift back to normalcy. Hindsight is 20/20 sure, but I believed then that Biden should have refused to run for a second term, instead choosing to throw his support behind whomever emerged from the primaries, while laying low and putting up guardrails in case of a Trump re-election.But now the history books will see this presidency as an effort that tried to pick up the pieces before the next storm arrived. An economic crisis emerged at the end of the last two Republican administrations, and both times a Democrat stepped in and was forced to oversee a recovery. Republicans took advantage of these crises to point fingers and rally their voters around wedge issues and disingenuous campaign talking points.Trump will be inheriting a growing economy, *again*, which is frustrating to say the least. He will take credit for everything he can take credit for, and will avoid taking responsibility for anything that might tarnish his legacy in the eyes of his supporters.Under Trump's last term:- The Natl Debt ballooned by nearly 40 percent\\n- He started a trade war with China\\n- He pressured the fed to keep interest rates low for a political edge \\n- He championed tax cut legislation that did not \\"pay for itself\\", and disproportionately and permanently benefitted the rich and corporations. This legislation is estimated to cost the government trillions\\n- His admin took several actions to make it more difficult for workers to unionize and for unions to operate effectively.\\n- He mishandled the covid pandemic at nearly every turn, and left office with the economy in tatters. *All of these things, by comparison, contributed more to inflationary trends and economic issues that extended into the next administration*- He cozied up to dictators and autocrats around the globe\\n- His foreign policy was disastrous, he escalated conflicts in multiple theaters, compromised our position as peace brokers, emboldened and enabled Putin's agenda, withdrew from the working non proliferation agreement with Iran, negotiated with terrorists, weakened our alliances, strengthened our enemy's geopolitical positions, and instituted tariffs that did far more harm than good, among other things.His presidency helped preserve a GOP agenda that's been redistributing wealth to the top and crippling the labor movement for decades. And of course, he facilitated an attack on our Capitol.Not to mention, he's been the most divisive, incendiary political figure in recent memory. He's been a beacon for hate groups, a leader for extremists and conspiracy theorists, a demagogue appealing to the worst impulses, the victimhood and the grievances of Americans, and he's empowered an ultra nationalistic, nativist, anti-intellectual, xenophobic, chauvinistic movement in this country. A movement of people who are extremely cynical, cautious, paranoid and intolerant of not just foreigners, but of a long list of fabricated boogeymen and deep state machinations. Trump is a symptom of a disease yes, but a symptom, nonetheless, that should send you to the emergency room. It was of necessity that Trump be voted out in 2020, two consecutive Trump terms would have been far more damaging. Biden's transitional presidency was supposed to be that trip to the emergency room... But now, he's been sandwiched in between two Trump terms, and we're leaving the hospital against medical advice. However, we should, at the very least, find some consolation in the fact that the last four years might mitigate some of the damage to come, or at a minimum, provide some obstacles for Republicans where there would have been none otherwise.But when all is said and done, Trump won with about the same amount of voters as the last election. \\nDemocrats did not do an effective job at informing receptive voters of basic things like Trump's true economic and foreign policy record. They also failed to communicate on immigration. Specifically the part about Republicans exploiting it as a wedge issue for years, preferring fearmongering tactics, and extreme, non viable \\"solutions\\" over practical, humane, economically considerate policies. What's more, Democrats were forced to shoehorn in a candidate at the last minute that millions of Democrats didn't turn out for because an effective case wasn't made and the party didn't account for things that should have been accounted for, like how in some cases, especially when it comes to low propensity voters, they care far more about their immediate circumstances than any threat to democracy, which is unfortunate yes, but a reality for some Americans.And sadly, this may also include the idea that some Americans just aren't willing to vote for a woman when the alternative is a perceived strongman, especially when a culture and \\"crisis\\" of masculinity is on the rise, regardless of its legitimacy. Democrats miscalculated how little Americans care about Trump's dangerous and unconstitutional rhetoric, how some may think Trump's absurdity renders him benign, because, for some reason, Trump has been sane washed and normalized by the media and general public. They also may have miscalculated how many Americans just aren't tuned into it. Either way, it was a miscalculation.Walter Lippman once called the general public an \\"irrational force.\\" A message that should resonate with some of us now more than ever. He was dismayed by the fact that voters don't often make politically informed decisions, they make *feelings* based decisions. And that's what got Trump elected, feelings.","title":"Why did Kamala Harris lose the election?"},{"text":"Then you runYou can be pissed - we're all disheartened, but calling for their resignation while not doing anything yourself is just poor form and further divides the party.

Then four years later it was back to the nonstop doom and gloom. That sort of immersion has a real effect on your psyche.Fox News isn't just presenting a version of reality in the best possible light for the GOP, they're actively and aggressively wagging the dog. If they want their voter base agitated, they consciously agitate. Want them complacent? They calm them. Expect a deluge of arguments from the right that the economy is now magically fixed the day Trump takes office, because that's what they're going to be told.There does come a point where addressing reality becomes unavoidable, but people who think we're generally anywhere near that point lack imagination. By and large, despite the overall economic anxiety, people have jobs, they have a roof over their heads, they have nonstop 24/7 entertainment from their 6 different streaming services, and they're not going hungry. That's enough of a recipe to manufacture their contentedness.On the other hand, the result of elections involving Trump has had more to do with pushing turnout than with converting his cultists. Trump didn't get more votes than in 2020 - it looks like he got quite a lot less. It's that the opposition didn't show up, for reasons both strategic and acute. The incumbent dropping out of the race at the last minute and the sitting VP, who was the 9th place finisher in the 2020 primaries, taking over, is never going to be a recipe for driving enthusiasm.That plus the obvious observation that Trump is mortal, and much of his support dies out when he does. He is showing signs of advanced dementia already and not much younger than his dad was when he succumbed to it. It's not realistic, I think, for a lightweight like Vance to carry his momentum forward, and no other heir apparent to the MAGA movement has appeared (in no small part because Trump's ego won't allow for it).","title":"Sanders: Democratic Party has abandoned working class people"},{"text":"Yup.Fuck Putin and fuck Trump","title":"As the world waits for Trump, time runs out for Biden to help Ukraine"},{"text":"Well said.

In the US, the Greens and Libertarians are basically irrelavant. There is no other major democracy which is as strictly and rigidly two-party, as the US is. Whereas the 3rd and 4th parties even in Australia and the UK still have a significant number of seats. For example, the SNP has a lot of weight because of the number of seats it has, and that further makes it an even more important voice for Scotland in the UK Parliament. Having seats in the UK Parliament gives the SNP much more influence and limelight than it would've ever had if it wasn't part of the UK Parliament. The third parties (and others) can only dream of this in the US. And we're talking about the UK, which is a much more two-party-like compared to the other multi-party systems. The smaller parties in the other truer multi-party systems have exponentially much more power and representation as compared to their equivalents in the UK. The gap is way way more than even that when it comes to their American equivalents instead. For example, look at India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, France, Germany, the Nordic countries, and some other European countries as well.

He has written extensively in the late 1800s about his vision of colonialism in Palestine. Those are his wordsMy point is the pattern of ignoring all other evidence that contradicts this, such as, you know, the actual history that transpired in the actual land. Herzl once said something, therefore all the rest of zionism and all israeli history can be ignored. Ignore the peace treaties, the actual deals with the UN, everything, just so you can claim all the evil Jews in Israel actually are part of this hundred year old racist conspiracy. Far too close to Nazism for my taste.For example, many people excuse Hamas because they got rid of *some* of their antisemitic language in their charter a couple years ago. What you're doing is laying blame to the entire concept of Israel for things it has no tangible connection to. It's like saying \\"look, one of the founding fathers of america once wrote that he wanted turkey to be the national bird, so that means all americans to this day think they have the turkey as a national bird and its literally part of the cultural blood of america\\"And what's the problem with anything he wrote here outlined in the article? He explains that it would only work in a country where Jewish immigration was definitely legal, and would fail if Jewish immigration were made illegal. That seems to make logical sense to me?Jabotinsky wrote about militarily dominating the native population.Where? You just linked to his general wikipedia article and a search for any of the keywords \\"dominate\\" and \\"native\\" turns up nothing.Here is Ben Gurion tooThis is the only thing that vaguely resembles what you were claimingIsrael was founded on an ethnic cleansing.This is false, as you can see from reading the plans for Plan Dalet. There were a couple towns that did not resist and the population was expelled simply for their ethnicity, but the hundreds of other towns that had people expelled this was not the case, they were expelled for fighting the army. Plus Israel was not founded on this act. Plus Israel has 20% its population as Palestinian Arabs whereas Palestine has 0% Jews, so the \\"ethnic cleansing\\" thing seems to not be entirely based in unbiased reasoning.Everything I posted is a Jewish sourceAnd none of it proved what you said.  this is like a nazi saying \\"All Jews want to destroy the whites, it is fundamental to their culture\\" and then posting a couple articles by far left activists who happen to be jewish talking about how they need to destroy whiteness as evidenceOh you mean the study that you never actually read? Because if you did read it you would know that \\"casualty\\" is not synonymous with \\"fatality.\\"Uh, no, I'm talking about something that is not a study but rather a statistic.

Certainly a case can be made that *nothing else will be accomplished*, without starting there.This will be exceedingly difficult, because simply getting elected in the first place absolutely requires selling one's soul to *some* devil. Even the very richest of our congresswhores has achieved their seat by spending someone else's money- and the inevitable *quid pro quo* is completely obvious, to even the least sophisticated voter.An immediate recusal of any individual legislator from any and all activities that impact said legislator's \\"sponsors\\" **in any way** would be certainly a good start. However, given the current dialing-for-dollars requirements or both chambers, in order to feed the party machinery behind them, pretty much every legislator has benefitted from pretty much every potentially-sponsoring entity that exists before they are even seated. All of the corporate johns have an ideal buyer's market, at the moment, and the worst of them have plowed money into *everyone's* PACs.Unless and until someone comes up with a good mechanism with which to control, and eventually put an end to, the large-scale grift that is now essentially the only activity conducted in Washington, efforts to accomplish anything else will be nipped in the bud by the minions of whatever industries or interest groups that might be affected.Unless we could identify a suicidal (or term-limited) congresswhore who is willing to name names, number numbers, and generally derail the many gravy trains, I hold out little hope of anything else happening. Money talks far louder than mere good intentions.Somehow breaking the lobbyist-payola cycle might be a start. Lobbyists have clearly been the primary corrupting influence for  over a century, and they are arguably the reason that there are no longer any Mr. Smiths attempting to go to Washington. But I lack both the wisdom and the ideas of how to accomplish that legally. It seems that, when the laws are written by the corrupt, the result will always be corruption being protected by the same laws.But your mileage may vary.

I feel that way. But nothing will ever get better for anybody if we all just give up. Take your time that's fine. But there is literally no way this gets better for anybody in the whole world if anybody just gives up. I read a lot today about why people think Harris lost and a lot of people say that those corporate Democrats are out of touch with what the average voter wants. Ideally they listen and we get a better candidate and we vote in midterms and we vote in primaries and we protest and we show up. We got through the '60s we got through the 70s. There was an era of civil rights. This is not the time to give up because change is possible we've all seen it. Some of us have seen it in our lifetimes. They want to once thought the divine right of kings would last forever. If you want to give up I guess I can't stop you. But what about trans kids? What about gay kids? They're growing up in this world. Some don't pass. What about everybody who's neurodivergent or people who are disabled? I read a really moving comment today and this guy was talking about how everybody is showing their privilege by being able to give up. Some people can't. I want better. I'm not saying it's not going to be hard and I'm not saying that this isn't a demoralizing loss because it is but I have seen so many people talk about how they are never going to vote again how they are not going to protest how they no longer care. We cannot all just sit back and wait for Armageddon and hope to survive it. That's not how life works. A lot of people are not party people they are not Republicans and they are not Democrats . One of the best arguments that I've heard today is that it's very hard to care about immigrant rights when you cannot feed your own children. Another woman is talking about how she cannot fathom caring about abortion rights when she cannot pay rent. Personally I disagree. I don't believe that Trump is any kind of Savior. But there is this narrative out there that he is better for the economy and people believe it. I think that a lot more people right now are focused on the economy and they think that it's Republicans that will save the working class. \\nThat sucks and it's untrue. A lot of people are talking about how the Democratic party has some serious soul-searching to do and hopefully it gets done.  There is a epidemic of misinformation right now right before the election people were googling to find out why Joe Biden wasn't on the ballot. The solution is not people becoming uninformed in apathetic that is literally the problem. Midterms are in two years. I really hope that we all show up. I hope they pick really strong candidates and I really really hope that there is something that we can do. I don't have the luxury of just leaving the country. I'm going to assume that a lot of people who are check to check also don't. I have to care. I hope things get better.","title":"What do we do now?"},{"text":"The Dems had a misinformation campaign w/ articles, ads etc...https://preview.redd.it/i99x1k9o9dzd1.png?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4d7488159757f2603960ba9d1146a7c1e3b17f4","title":"After a historic loss, CNN continues man hate and racism...They just don't get it."},{"text":"Yep.","title":"U.S. Rep.

Become a strong party that puts the other side in its place or at least keeps them from getting away with everything, even if she won last night, it would have been on a needle thin margin. \\nRegardless, the Biden administration in regards to dealing with Maga did practically nothing, they viewed Maga as a dead threat, despite the obvious Maga corruption within the legislative and the judicial branch, but the administration did nothing. Some strong Democrat leaders tried to do something, but they were the minority within the government level Democrats.\\nIt's still shocking she lost in the sense of just how much she lost. She lost pretty significantly, it also doesn't help that alot of 2020 Democrat voters, just didn't vote this time. They either felt compliant and thought Trump had zero chance of winning, or just didn't want to vote in support for a black Indian woman. It's as simple as that, I also feel like this is a (sad) lesson, since it's now been repeated for the 2nd time. That we are very far away from there being a chance for a woman president.\\nExpect the 2028 Democrat candidate to absolutely be White, Male, 50s-60s. ( saying this in a factual statement, not as a, oh it has to happen thing, tho it does to have a chance of winning 2028).\\nAnd the candidate needs to be a Strong leader, Harris wasn't exactly weak, and given more time to be an active candidate, I believe the numbers could have slightly been better in her favor. But it just wasn't in the numbers. We need a Democrat candidate in 2028 that will absolutely let the entirety of the nation know that Maga will be shutdown, and Maga criminals will be punished.\\nUnlike Bush, where Obama was the change Most people wanted. People seriously, (referring to Trump voters) and we saw last night, do not want a change from Trump.\\nMost of the Gop consider him either as the best or 2nd best Republican president post ww2.

Heres my take on how the Democratic Partys choices over the years led to these results:     In 2016, many within the Democratic Party felt that the primary was unfairly tilted towards Hillary Clinton, who was historically and at the time unpopular. The Republicans, on the other hand, had a competitive primary and seemed to listen to their base.     During the general election, Trump and the GOP campaigned heavily in the Rust Belt, speaking to the concerns of the working class and promised to address them (even if it was a facade). Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign took these voters for granted, focusing on Her messaging and courting higher-income and college educated voters who didnt typically vote Democratic.     As the working class began leaving the Democratic Party, feeling ignored, they were often called racist or sexist for supporting Trumpeven if they were mainly looking for someone who acknowledged their economic struggles.     This persisted through Trumps presidency and into the 2020 election. Trump benefited from a strong economy pre-COVID, which was likely caused by Democratic policies under Obama. However, recency bias often effects the party in power, which helped Trumps appeal to some.     In 2020, the Democratic primary again felt tilted, with Biden as the perceived favorite. During the general election, Biden won over upper/middle-class and college educated voters, helped by the pressures around the pandemic. However, the GOP continued gaining support from the working class, minority groups and women.     Biden inherited a volatile economy due to the pandemic and faced resistance in Congress that limited his ability to pass policy. Those that did pass werent seen as helpful or quick enough, so people new frustrated. Many recalled the relatively strong economy under Trump and compared it to their current situation.     In the 2024 primary, Biden chose to run again rather than passing the torch, and the Democratic Party blocked any real primary competition. While the GOP already knew and supported Trump as their candidate as he remained popular with their base. This was something Biden was struggling with. After a rough debate performance, Biden was replaced, not by any of the 2024 primary candidates, but by Kamala Harris, who had dropped out of the 2020 primary and was already viewed as part of an unpopular administration.     Harris ran a competitive campaign and tried to reach the working class. Many found her insincere, and the labeling of dissatisfied voters as racist, sexist or fascist continued. Trump gained even more working class support, including from minority groups and women. Harris struggled to motivate both the Democratic base and middle-class voters.While I skipped over some factors between elections (2022 midterms, international events, SCOTUS decisions, etc.), I believe these choices by the Democratic Party have driven voters towards the GOP.TL;DR: The Democratic Partys strategy of prioritizing college educated and middle class voters has alienated the working class and non college educated voters. When these voters turned to Trump, they were often labeled as racist, sexist or fascist. They are now frustrated, feeling left behind economically and rejected by a party that once claimed to represent them. Additionally, the lack of real primaries (starting with Bernie Sanders) in the last three election cycles has left many Democratic supporters feeling disenfranchised.","title":"Bidens stupidity and selfishness sank Kamala, say Democrat donors"},{"text":"Wish this would happen to conservatives with their judges.

The Republicans, on the other hand, had a competitive primary and seemed to listen to their base.     During the general election, Trump and the GOP campaigned heavily in the Rust Belt, speaking to the concerns of the working class and promised to address them (even if it was a facade). Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign took these voters for granted, focusing on Her messaging and courting higher-income and college educated voters who didnt typically vote Democratic.     As the working class began leaving the Democratic Party, feeling ignored, they were often called racist or sexist for supporting Trumpeven if they were mainly looking for someone who acknowledged their economic struggles.     This persisted through Trumps presidency and into the 2020 election. Trump benefited from a strong economy pre-COVID, which was likely caused by Democratic policies under Obama. However, recency bias often effects the party in power, which helped Trumps appeal to some.     In 2020, the Democratic primary again felt tilted, with Biden as the perceived favorite. During the general election, Biden won over upper/middle-class and college educated voters, helped by the pressures around the pandemic. However, the GOP continued gaining support from the working class, minority groups and women.     Biden inherited a volatile economy due to the pandemic and faced resistance in Congress that limited his ability to pass policy. Those that did pass werent seen as helpful or quick enough, so people new frustrated. Many recalled the relatively strong economy under Trump and compared it to their current situation.     In the 2024 primary, Biden chose to run again rather than passing the torch, and the Democratic Party blocked any real primary competition. While the GOP already knew and supported Trump as their candidate as he remained popular with their base. This was something Biden was struggling with. After a rough debate performance, Biden was replaced, not by any of the 2024 primary candidates, but by Kamala Harris, who had dropped out of the 2020 primary and was already viewed as part of an unpopular administration.     Harris ran a competitive campaign and tried to reach the working class. Many found her insincere, and the labeling of dissatisfied voters as racist, sexist or fascist continued. Trump gained even more working class support, including from minority groups and women. Harris struggled to motivate both the Democratic base and middle-class voters.While I skipped over some factors between elections (2022 midterms, international events, SCOTUS decisions, etc.), I believe these choices by the Democratic Party have driven voters towards the GOP.P.S. I believe Bernie was the Democratic Party's answer to the downfall of Neo liberalism, like Trump was for the GOP. The Dems just stopped him and the movement, where the GOP embraced Trump.TL;DR: The Democratic Partys strategy of prioritizing college educated and middle class voters has alienated the working class and non college educated voters. When these voters turned to Trump, they were often labeled as racist, sexist or fascist. They are now frustrated, feeling left behind economically and rejected by a party that once claimed to represent them. Additionally, the lack of real primaries (starting with Bernie Sanders) in the last three election cycles has left many Democratic supporters feeling disenfranchised.","title":"Sanders: Democratic Party has abandoned working class people"},{"text":"What would you do different than biden:\\"I'd double down on being prounion, pro worker rights and pro consumer policies.

Thats following forcing Hillary to the top of the ticket in 2016 when Sanders - Trump voters would have more than covered his win in the blue wall.

There is no more fight in a lot of people because for many of us we just don't see a point. I could get him winning against Hillary. She was objectively one of the worst candidates the Dems have ran. She really was that damned unlikable that a person like Trump managed to win. We had 4 years of him. We had 4 years of seeing what a constant daily shitshow it was with him at the helm of our country. We saw how he handled crisis. We saw him be a racist pile of trash. We saw him appeal to the worst parts of our country and we saw him promise again and again what he would do with power. We saw him rig our Supreme Court with help from his followers in Congress. Then we saw him lose to Biden. Many people didn't like Biden, many still don't. But he was a clear candidate who ran on the one platform people could get behind. At least he's not Trump. And he won. There was an attempted insurrection. There was an attack on our democracy. There was 4 years of MAGA nonsense from the Freedumb caucus in Congress. There was the trials. The constant unending line of things showing Trump for who and what he was. A criminal. A racist. A rapist. A fraud. An unhinged mentally ill individual. Not a single thing has ever shown him in a positive light or proven to show him as a decent human being at all. And he just beat Harris. A skilled politician who has served in all three branches of government, an articulate, intelligent, and capable individual. Possibly one of the best candidates I've seen come out of the Dems in ages. And she picked Walz, who was practically America's dad with his aw shucks good clean wholesomeness. Trump picked Vance, a man loathed and looked down upon by the people he claims to be from, an obvious racist, an obviously dangerous individual. When you match these two sides against each other, it should have been a no brainer. And somehow, here we are with numbers that make no damned sense. Trump beat Harris. I don't know how. I don't know why. By all logic there should not have been a shot in hell of him winning. And yet he did. And he brought the House and Senate with him. We have a stacked Supreme Court that has already deemed his crimes excusable and his actions perfectly legal. We have a stacked Congress. We're defeated. We're exhausted. There is no more fight because there is nothing left to fight. If Harris and Walz, two of the better candidates I've seen in awhile, lose to someone like Trump, there really is no point. Because we've seen how the DNC acts, we've seen the type of candidates we get to choose from. And we know damned well that there is no chance in hell of them learning a single fucking thing from this election and unfucking themselves to unfuck this country. They didn't learn a fucking thing in 2020 and they sure as shit didn't learn a thing this year either. We squeaked by in 20 because Biden stood on the one platform that people could get behind. He wasn't Trump. Harris stood on a platform of the rights of women, the rights of minorities, the rights of the LGBTQ+ communities and the rights of your average fucking American.

Tax dollars going to a federal school lunch grants? Improving education nationally? Propping healthcare up? A lot of states had an influx of people seeking reproductive healthcare because of the loss of this in their home states, and this has put on a burden on state-level resources, but it's accepted all the same because that's what is the right thing to do. It sucks, it probably shouldn't be done, but turning people away because of their politics and the way they vote is still cruel. It _SUCKS_ that this is the way it is, but it is the way it is.The unfortunate reality is that the electorate, by and large, refuses to vote for anyone that champions for what is the right thing to do. The electorate by and large simply will not do it. GOP-led states draining federal resources are a burden, but cutting them off just to spite the poor, the disenfranchised, and the suffering is simply against the ethos of the Democrats. And because this is the way it is, the Democrats' continue to struggle.The Democrats, in general, need to appeal to everyone fully, a feat that is pragmatically impossible, because the Democrats seek to represent everyone. They will never be able to do so, and shifting their focus away to represent only those who will vote for them will cause them to lose voters too. It's a lose-lose situation.Campaigning on empathy and caring for others does not win elections. Campaigning on memes and baser human instincts like fear and hate of the other does. But I'm unconvinced doing so would bring the Democrats closer to electoral success, because everything the Democrats do to appeal to one portion of the electorate can easily alienate the another.

Held emotional space for their pain. As a person in counseling grad school- it amazes me that people still fail to understand that human beings are emotional beings first, and not Vulcans. Very few of us can make reasonable choices when in a heated emotional state. The only way to reach angry, frustrated people (and I said the same thing to people policing BLM activists breaking windows) is to start by contacting the anger and pain. That looks like this: your suffering is valid, this situation is super hard that you are in. This is what the republicans do effectively, then once the emotions are validated, they blame the wrong people (immigrants, trans people etc) and claim to be able to fix it. This is what democrats do: I dont understand what the big deal is, heres a series of facts explaining why your feelings are wrong.I mean its literally the same dynamic that often gets men in trouble in close relationships. Meeting emotions with intellectual arguments and facts like its a high school debate or something.Thats just literally not how humans operate at a deep level, like millions of years of evolutionary biology. Bernie Sanders effectively starts by saying the economy is rigged against you, your pain is valid  then he blames the appropriate parties and puts forward policy after policy to fix it. Dems cant keep downplaying how bad wealth inequality and affordable housing and cost of living and wage stagnation has been and then point to GDP and jobs numbers like that matters when the quality of jobs available is often not great pay and benefit wise. And quite honestly the Democratic alliance with people like Mark Cuban is out of touch. Is it bizarre and irrational people fall for Trumps Everyman con and alliance with Elon Musk? Sure. But its also entirely understandable people are angry and fed up with, yes, the death of the American dream, and its very human to not be able to think rationally when upset and in the midst of real survival concerns. And if only Trump contacts their anger and creates space for it then he wins. When things reach a point like this, populism will win - and unfortunately if left wing populism of the FDR quality isnt available, whats left is right wing populism. There is a way to contact and hold space for anger and allow it to transform into optimism but it has to start with contacting and validating the pain.","title":"Sanders: Democratic Party has abandoned working class people"},{"text":"Im a heterodox, so the projection isnt appreciated.About the rest of the content, though - this is a constant conversation we should have been having, but sometimes, its hard for most of the public to see through the trees. Since the Bush era, the polarization has certainly made the overreach of the executive more pronounced in its illustration.The wrong solutions keep getting deployed by both sides: lets get our person in there. Instead: lets limit the overreach and ensure congress does it roles in legislation and is more directive in its representation.We need to find a way to incentivize congress to do its job, instead of delegating to the executive and judiciary.Relegating the congress to choose the president is simply a recreation of the parliamentary system across the pond, introduces more biases, and erodes more checks and balances. We need the executive to be independent like the founders intended and more in check, just like other branches.","title":"We made the presidency too powerful"},{"text":"Yeah, which is why I said the Moreno Party, which is was led by AMLO swept.

Joe Biden is the singular reason Kamala Harris and Democrats lost.Some of the sharpest criticism was reserved for the party machine of concealing the truth about the outgoing presidents mental fitness.Why did Joe Biden hold on for as long as he did? He should have not concealed his (health) and dropped out a lot sooner, one party donor told the Reuters news agency.The party lied to the American people about the cognitive health and fitness of the president, Bill Ackman, a longtime Democratic donor who endorsed Trump, added.Before his untimely withdrawal from the contest, Mr Bidens cognitive abilities had been called into question by his debate performance versus Trump and a series of gaffes, including referring to Volodymyr Zelensky as President Putin.His delayed decision to step down left Ms Harris only 107 days between becoming the new Democratic nominee and election day.However, both her campaign and the White House were confident going into decision day.Internal polling by both camps suggested Ms Harris was on an upwards trajectory and only gaining new voters the longer the contest went on.Campaign emails to the most important backers emphasised a surprise poll showing Ms Harris up in the state of Iowa as the main reason for their confidence, sources told the Telegraph.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/06/joe-biden-cling-on-white-house-cost-harris-election/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/06/joe-biden-cling-on-white-house-cost-harris-election/)","title":"Bidens stupidity and selfishness sank Kamala, say Democrat donors"},{"text":"No. Biden should drone Trump on his way out the door","title":"Biden should pardon Trump"},{"text":"she handled it like she won't be persecuted simply for being a democrat, like democracy and her own rights weren't on the line. tho tbf, i wouldn't know what else to do in her situation that isn't \\"do a coup yourself before he seizes power first\\"","title":"Kamala Harris: \\"We must accept the results of this election.

Let's compare elections.2016 Trump V Clinton Popular Vote:\\n     Trump: 62.9 M |\\n     Hillary: 65.8 M\\nElectoral Votes:\\n     Trump: 304 |\\n     Hillary: 2272020 Trump V Biden Popular Vote:\\n     Trump: 74.2 M |\\n     Biden: 81.2 MElectoral Votes:\\n     Trump: 232 |\\n     Biden: 3062024 Trump V Harris (so far):Popular Vote:\\n     Trump: 72 M |\\n     Harris: 67.1 MElectoral Votes:\\n     Trump: 294 |\\n     Harris: 223 Drawing from what we've seen. 2020 Election Trump brought in 11 million more Republicans than he did originally in 2016. He is primed to bring in essentially the same number this election, if not less. The difference between Hillary and Harris' bids for election and Biden's are primarily (imo) voter trust. There's also the possibility that the difference in popular vote was due to the candidate being a woman, but I would like to believe the difference is in trust. The vast majority of voters did not like or trust Hillary. Likewise, the same can be said for this election. Compared to Biden, who brought the trust gained by the Obama administration. Trust is the primary cause of the 15.4 M and 14.1 M deficits between Hillary/Harris and Biden.The number of voters for Trump didn't really change between his loss to Biden and his victory against Harris. The number of democrats who voted did, and by a large margin. I do not blame you for not voting for Kamala Harris. I blame the DNC for consistently ignoring our wants as voters and giving us a candidate we didn't want or choose for ourselves. But this loss isn't because the number of fascists in America has changed.It's important we understand why this happened, as to avoid repeating it.","title":"Dems have no one to blame themselves"},{"text":"The mainstream media and leftist talking points have become a problem. Basically according to them:* \\"Trump is a fascist and if you support him you're a literal Nazi who is complicit in genocide\\"\\n* \\"If he gets four more years, say goodbye to all freedoms\\"In reality:* Trump is a me-first, 80+ year old man focused on his legacy who previously enjoyed support from many of the same people who now lambast him in the media (see Oprah, The View, etc.)\\n* Trump already had one term to go full dictator, if he was going to do that. He didn't.\\n* January 6th was a shitshow and an embarrassment, but Trump did not orchestrate it. It was largely a failure of Congress to prepare for and secure it, and Trump did himself no favors by lending vocal support to it before he likely knew the full extent of what it was, which gave the left talking points.\\n* Trump's actual platform is actually pretty popular, even though many Republicans and independents find his style abrasive. To his credit, he's done a better job avoiding some of the childish insults this time on the campaign trail that alienate constituents. I hope he'll continue this the second time around. The real test will be how he handles the media. But - look at what his administration does, not what he says. I was an undecided voter in 2016, and initially dreaded the Trump presidency, but I was willing to give him a shot and look at his policy objectively - which won me over with time.As for your views, I'd be careful about calling yourself \\"Progressive.\\" I know what it means, but to most people it means you support the far-left agenda of groups like the DSA and Working Families Party. You sound like a moderate that understands this country has issues and has not always lived up to its own ideals. These days, that actually makes you a conservative (in the eyes of most leftists) if you actually believe in those ideals.So, the sky is not falling. Some things will likely get better, but a lot of that will depend on how well Congress can get its act together and focus on the key issues that have bipartisan support (tackling inflation, the border, crime, ending global wars, countering China) and avoid focusing on issues that will cost the midterms or the next general (abortion, for one).(1/2) - see reply below for 2/2 which discusses policy.","title":"Lifelong blue voter.

Next to project 2025, and concentrating power in his hands, I can't see any issue actually being important. With Trump, that might have been our last fair election and our ability to get rid of someone not doing a good job is completely gone. That's an extreme risk to take from my perspective. You now have to trust that Trump is going to behave exactly the same with no checks and no need to keep popular support as he did before. You now have to also assume that Trump is going to pick the perfect people to come after him. I take it you don't care about climate change and his intentions to dismantle the EPA. I take it you hate public education and are fine with him eliminating the DOE. Is he going to use the Comstock act and end abortion pills nationally? How about contraception? What is deporting 20 million people going to do to the economy? How about making everything we import, including materials for things made here, cost at least 20% more?

There were two issues: time and messaging.Time because if she had been the candidate from the start, she would have had much more prep time which in turn would have helped with the second issue. People would have known her more. She would have been able to be more strategic about addressing weaknesses in battle ground states. It would have also helped to make the break from Biden clearer. There were plenty that just saw her as continuing Biden's policies rather than having her own. That leads to the bigger issue of messaging.Messaging because a consistent critique of the Harris campaign is that people didn't feel like they knew her positions or how they differed from Biden. She also had the bullshit narrative of a non-existent inflation problem to combat. That's a difficult narrative that requires concerted messaging that just didn't seem to appear. There was a lot of messaging around abortion access. That was good to have, important for many, and not relevant to a whole lot of others. For example, there is polling of Gen Z males that show they don't give a damn about abortion. They do care about jobs and the cost of things. Those are topics that were not as strongly messaged as they could have been. The reality is inflation is extremely low and the US is doing far better than the rest of the world. That message was out there, but it's presentation seemed infrequent and weak compared to others. Consequently, key demographics were lost. The Republicans win on that topic even though they're really bad at managing the economy because they maintain a consistent simple narrative of keeping taxes down so you have more money. The Dems consistently lose because they make their economic positions too complicated and academic. People care about their personal finances. They don't care about something abstract like what is happening with inflation because even when you hit good inflation rates like we have now, the cost of things can still be high for a while. There is a lag between inflation and the actual expenses people feel like they are paying. Also, there was a mass disinformation issue. For example myths surrounding FEMA  and what they were and were not doing vs funding. There have been people actually shooting at FEMA crews trying to provide assistance because of Internet lies that they were there to steal property. We've entered a period in which media is no longer trusted for news but social media can be.

Because if you did read it you would know that \\"casualty\\" is not synonymous with \\"fatality.\\" that stat includes people displaced by war. Moreover, you don't know how many civilians have been killed. No one does because Israel doesn't allow journalists (they also kill more journalists than in any other conflict) or independent observers to see what they are doing. If Israel was so trustworthy, why don't they allow journalists to come in? why don't they independent observers see what they are doing?","title":"CMV: Most People in the West that Support Palestine have no idea on the current situation in Palestine."},{"text":"I honestly don't think they shifted that much.

Right wing socioeconomic policies (laissez-faire capitalism) lead to social dysfunction as more and more people either fall into poverty or fear doing so. The mainstream right can't win elections on these policies any more because they have become unpopular, but rather than change those it either allies or becomes the extremist right (authoritarian and reactionary), going all in on distractions and scapegoating.This leaves the social liberals (pro-capitalist but not socially conservative) and the social democrats as the only democratic factions to counter them, but the former block most major re-distributive policies and even the most moderate moves towards a fairer society have to be fought over tooth and nail. This alliance (either as intra-party in a two party or as a coalition in multiparty systems) then fails to do enough to keep their voters on board, disillusionment sets in, voters stay home and the extremist right takes over.Fortunately, it doesn't always completely run through this cycle, but it keeps happening. It has now happened to the USA and the best case scenario is that when those lukewarm Trump supporters are angry at not getting what they wanted out of this \\"change\\" (and they won't), they will still have the means to vote the government out. If not, then you're stuck until a revolution happens.Arguing that more social democracy would have scared away voters is sort of pointless IMHO, because if that is true then you're doomed anyway.

You want a solution to this seemingly impossible corruption that has taken over our system?  Ok, I'll give it to you, so pay close attention.Back in the 1980s, the Democrats and Republicans were nearly trounced by independents and third parties, to the point where fears were growing that both parties were on the verge of losing power.  So they colluded to pass anti-democratic state laws that establish a double standard for ballot access.Basically, if you're a Republican or a Democrat, getting on the ballot is all-but guaranteed.  If you're anyone else, however, the requirements are structured in such a way that is reminiscent of poll tests.  Independents and third parties now have to spend literally 100% of their resources just qualifying for ballots in each of the 50 states, many of which have ballot access laws so restrictive for everyone but R/D that there are inevitably states where they don't qualify for the ballot.Meanwhile, the Democrats, who claim to be \\"champions of democracy\\", spend inordinate resources filing state lawsuits seeking to remove independents and third parties from the ballot so their supporters can't vote for them.  Yes, really.  And because they passed the bullshit laws on which these lawsuits are based, they tend to succeed.But then you have the 2016 primaries.  People who appeared on donor lists for Bernie Sanders came to the polls in closed primary states, only to find that *someone* had fraudulently changed their party affiliation without their consent so they wouldn't be allowed to vote in the primaries.  Notice how strongly they tend to rely on *preventing* their opponents from exercising their right to vote?  Some champions of democracy they turned out to be, but I digress.Those voters were forced to fill out provisional ballots.  Later, boxes of these provisional ballots for Bernie were found tossed into dumpsters outside polling places.  Champions of democracy, indeed.Oh but it gets better:  The Democrats then argued in court (successfully!) that, as a \\"private organization\\" (which shares exclusive access to our PUBLIC elections with the Republicans), the Democrats are legally entitled to rig their primaries as much as they want.  They are legally allowed to choose their candidates however they please (like any private club.... with exclusive access to the Presidency) AND lie to the public about it by claiming to hold a free and fair election.  Oh and did I mention that they're champions of democracy?Now we have these \\"private organizations\\" having sole authority over who gets to run for President of the United States.  If you run as a Democrat, they can block your supporters from voting for you because they're a private club.  If you run as an independent, they can block your supporters from voting for you because they're a public institution.  Funny how that works, eh?So with that in mind, how do our third-party and independent candidates fare?  Because they're not on all state ballots, their path to victory is essentially closed before a single vote is cast.  Most voters know this and assume they can't possibly win, creating a sort of self-fulfilling prophesy.  This is reinforced by the news media constantly drilling the message into us that independents and third parties are fundamentally unelectable, despite having more popularity than the two parties in power.**When elections come around, those third-party and independent candidates poll in the single digits because the system has been rigged so that most of their supporters *aren't allowed* to vote for them.**  Laws preventing write-ins from being counted and unconstitutionally banning people from posting photos of their own ballots also contribute to this.**Now, here's the solution:**  Repeal these anti-democratic state laws and replace them with Range Voting.  Target those states with direct democracy initiatives/referenda so we don't need to rely on politicians who owe their jobs to this corrupt rigging to actually fix it.  We can do it, ourselves.It will take funding.  It will take organization.  And it will take a willingness to set aside this hopelessness.  But if we were to do this and repeal those laws, this forced \\"two-party system\\" that ignores the will of the American public will collapse like a house of cards.That's our path to victory.  That's where we find hope.","title":"You were right"},{"text":"I keep trying to explain this to people.

Especially while a seismic realignment has pushed workers away from centre-left parties across much of the developed world. Yet thats just the sort of campaign Kamala Harris ran: one premised on the defend democracy sentiments of affluent suburbanites, instead of the promise of social and economic democracy.The gambit didnt pay off. As I write, Donald Trump appears poised to clinch the popular vote C a first for a Republican presidential nominee since 2004, and the second since 1988 C and to sweep the battleground states. Its safe to say that Trumpism in American politics is an era, in the same way we think of the Reagan era. The long-term trend of US politics, in other words, is right-wing populism; the Joe Biden interlude was just that.Speaking of Bidenism, Harris might have done better had she enthusiastically articulated the populist elements of her bosss vision: the industrial policies, the rural development, the tariffs, the anti-trust crusade. Instead, she touted that her economic platform had won plaudits from Goldman Sachs, that most beloved of institutions, even as she wouldnt commit to retaining Lina Khan, Bidens bold anti-trust czar (whose efforts JD Vance was more apt to praise). Her surrogates bashed tariffs as a tax on consumers, seemingly unaware that Team Biden had retained and expanded Trumps on Chinese goods.History had dealt Harris a lousy hand: a politician who had never won a nationwide primary received her partys nomination after Bidens disastrous debate in June, in which the much diminished president vowed to beat Medicare. Still, it isnt hard to pinpoint a slew of unforced errors on Harriss part.For starters, there was her catastrophic lack of vision. It was hard to discern a story beyond defend democracy and protecting womens right to an abortion. The latter no doubt motivated some women. But given Team Trumps shift away from the anti-abortion cause, it didnt do much. As for democracy, voting for Trump was practising democracy for many millions of Americans. The notion that democracy itself was on the ballot had few buyers outside the editorial boards of the Atlantic and the New York Times.In place of a cohesive narrative, Harris offered a barrage of lame micro-policies: small-business loans, homebuyer grants, handouts to the scammy crypto industry, encouraging black marijuana entrepreneurs, scrapping tax on restaurant tips (a gimmick lifted from Trumps agenda) and so on. What happened to the sorts of things that used to make left parties attractive to ordinary people: Medicare for all? Student- and medical-loan forgiveness? Peace in the Middle East?Speaking of the Middle East, Harris somehow managed to alienate Muslims over Gaza, going so far as to bar a Palestinian speaker from her partys convention, without endearing herself to the pro-Israel community, either. Trump achieved the opposite: he became the toast of the Israeli public while garnering endorsements from a number of imams and Muslim mayors in Michigan, a crucial battleground. Few expect him to restrain the IDF in Gaza, but theres a reassuring sense that, with Trump, what you see is what you get.Then there was illegal immigration C not a mere problem for the Democrats, but a catastrophe. Having dismantled Trumps signature border-control measures, the Biden administration oversaw the arrival of millions of low-wage, unvetted immigrants, including gang members. They fanned out beyond the border states, putting pressure on public services and criminal-justice systems in even tolerant blue states.Footage of low-income Americans, including black and brown people, complaining of schools and childrens recreation centres converted to migrant shelters soon proliferated on social media C but national Democrats paid little heed until it was too late. Harris tried to be hard line on immigration, but her promises were vague, and she couldnt give a reasonable account of why she changed her mind.None of this is to deny the numerous contradictions in Trump, who has been resurrected, like the revenant of Greek myth, to greater power than he possessed before his sojourns through the Hades of defeat and lawfare. But US voters get a binary choice, and a choice they have made. Democrats, too, now face a choice: to finally grant popular rage and work toward bipartisan solutions C or to indulge another four years of fruitless #Resistance.","title":"Why Kamala Harriss gambit failed | For millions of Americans, voting for Trump was democracy in action."},{"text":"Seekers of economic rent","title":"Rule Clarifications"},{"text":"focus on the peace deals Why wont peace deals happen? after the 2 proxy wars that started under Biden and Kamalas watch","title":"The year is 2026 and Project 2025 never happened.

America got what it deserved tonight. Democracy here is done. The House of Representatives is gone. The Senate is gone. The White House will now be run by a traitor to democracy:JD Vance. This nation is going to go into its darkest, and possibly last age. With it will come violence that dons a mask of perverse patriotism, wrapped in the colors of a flag that have faded and stitched together with a necklace bearing a Christian cross, upon which a white Jesus sits. The violence that happens here will not be alone. Many other nations will suffer as the bastion that once kept others at bay, such as Russia, Iran, China and North Korea will instead become their allies. The policies that will dictate this will be mirrored, unless you separate from us. Unfortunately tonight, America has become your enemy. We have whiddled away at our own education, and weaponized fear in concert with plans that were laid out by our own leaders these last seventy years to erode both.  The anger in this nation will likely see violence from those who stood against it. Brother will fight brother, and eventually the ones who are slain will be boasted as traitors and terrorists. And then when the violence from those who are angry does out, because it comes too late, it will continue in secret, out of the representation of media, and will make those in power smile. You must distance yourselves from America. You must be ready to fight this country immediately in the morality, and possibly on the battlefield in twenty years. Do not let what has happened to us happen to you. Save yourselves. And if you voted for Trump: Fuck. You. I hope when you find me, you end it all violently because I am tired.

We are still waiting on the election data but it seems like we failed at getting our base out, which is most likely due to lack of policy they favor, this could be because Kamala ran on no real hard policy changes besides abortion(which people normally dont vote on). We also lost the middle ground voters(young men, Latinos, and independents) who vote mainly on economy(which hurt us due to inflation) and feeling of being recognized by either side(which honestly we didnt do).

Not a conspiracy just a bad candidate.I really think this is the case. President Trump seems to have gotten roughly the same number of votes in 2024 as he did in 2020.  He got 74 million in 2020, he's at 72 million now and counting. And frankly that makes sense. President Trump is a known quantity.  He's been in the news every day for the last 10 years. You either love him or hate him.  So the people who voted for him in 2020 voted for him in 2024, and the people who didn't vote for him in 2020 didn't vote for him in 2024. It looks like President Trump made some moderate gains among certain groups, such as male black and Latino voters, but I suspect we're going to see very few crossover votes from Biden in 2020 to Trump in 2024.Biden got 81 million votes in 2020 because people hated Trump, were nostalgic for Obama, and wanted a change.  But Biden's presidency was a disaster.  He presided over the pandemic, the worst economy since Jimmy Carter, the worst refugee crisis since World War II, the collapse of Afghanistan, war in the Ukraine, war in Palestine (and let's not forget how much Biden's support for Israel infuriated the left)... long story short, Biden's presidency faced enormous challenges and he failed to measure up to them. And then Biden capstoned that failure by pulling an RBG and insisting on running again despite his failing health.  And when Biden was forced to drop out, Harris, who had no real accomplishments or policy plans of her own, took over last minute and ran a campaign promising to continue Biden's policies and warning of the dangers of a second Trump administration.And listen, because there's going to be gigabytes of after action commentary, but here's the absolute bottom line: Harris ran a campaign based on fear of a second Trump term when *the average American was better off under Trump than Biden*.
