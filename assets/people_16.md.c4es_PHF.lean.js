Britt found 14 defining characteristics:1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Make America Great Again.  2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights C Separating children from parents and breaking Asylum laws.  3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - Lock her Up.  Mexicans, theyre rapists. They bring crime.  Im calling for a complete and total shutdown of Muslims.  Immigrants are poisoning the blood of our nation.4. Supremacy of the Military C given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. 5. Rampant Sexism C traditional gender roles are made more rigid. The state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.  Ill protect women whether the women like it or not.6. Controlled Mass Media C In the two months leading up to the 2024 election, Trump attacked the media, or as Trump has called the press, the Enemy of the People, over 100 times. He has made several calls for broadcast licenses to be revoked.7.  Obsession  with National Security C Fear is used as a motivational tool.  Build the Wall.  I will do the largest deportation of criminals in American history.8. Religion and Government are intertwined. Trump played Evangelicals like a fiddle, promising conservative justices, in exchange for their support. They continue to support Trump with idolatry fervor, literally rolling out a golden statue of Trump, at CPAC. The Christian nationalist movement behind Project 2025 hopes to remake the United States into a so-called Christian nation, repressing diversity and difference and imposing one extreme religious worldview on all of us.9. Corporate Power is Protected.  Marketed as a middle class tax cut in his first administration, Trump admitted the corporate tax reduction was probably the biggest factor in the GOP tax plan.  More corporate tax cuts and a shift of wealth to the top are coming.  10. Labor Power is Suppressed C during his first administration, Trump assembled one of the most elite pro business Billionaire cabinets in US history. Expect more of the same in his second administration. Trump told us in 2016 he would stand with workers. He lied. The difference now is that he has a record he cant hide from. And that record was catastrophic for workers. 11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts C During his first administration, Trump proposed budget cuts for agencies that fund the arts and humanities. 12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment C Under fascist regimes, the people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even fore-go civil liberties. Trump has threatened the enemies from within.  With loyalists in place, I have no doubt Trump will go after his perceived enemies.  13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption C Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. Expect more of this in his second term.  14. Fraudulent Elections C Russia, if youre listening .... Fascist leaders will attack the legitimacy of elections to stir up non-confidence in future elections. Of course Trump railed against the stolen election in 2020 and incited a violent mob on January 6.  He was ramping up his fraudulent election claims before this election. But not surprisingly, went quiet after he was determined the winner. The majority of Americans have spoken. It does not mean the majority is right. But it means this is what they want.

Do they do that by acting like Norway and providing paid parental leave and make childrearing more affordable and schools more safe? Nah, they demonize abortion so that if a woman gets pregnant then she's forced to have a kid. Yay - problem solved! The goal is to make the laws in this country more draconian, so as to force people to behave in a way that suits the american imperialistic agenda. Do I see that working? Well, if you've ever spoken to an american in your life then good luck forcing them to do anything they don't want to do. Half the country wouldn't even wear a goddamn face mask during the highs of covid. Maybe if this were a homogenous society with a heavy emphasis on shame, like idk Korea, then yea sure you can get the population to fall in line. But good luck with Americans because they're a very stubborn and selfish people, which honestly might be their greatest asset in defending themselves against Project 2025.","title":"After Trumps win, some women are considering the 4B movement."},{"text":"Projection is a Curse of people who aren't hard on themselves on the matter of self-reflection.

But over the past half century that basic impulse underwent two great distortions. The first was the rise of neoliberalism, an economic doctrine that sanctified markets and reduced the ability of governments to protect those hurt by economic change. The world got a lot richer in the aggregate, while the working class lost jobs and opportunity. Power shifted away from the places that hosted the original industrial revolution to Asia and other parts of the developing world.The second distortion was the rise of identity politics or what one might call woke liberalism, in which progressive concern for the working class was replaced by targeted protections for a narrower set of marginalised groups: racial minorities, immigrants, sexual minorities and the like.

Mr Trump visited during his recent campaign and turned the tide.Mr Trumps electoral vote count currently stands at 312 over Ms Harris 226 - which is 42 more than he needed to secure the White House for a second term.The Republicans have also regained control of the Senate and look likely to retain a majority in the House of Representatives.The latest good news for Mr Trump came as the White House confirmed Mr Biden would meet with the president-elect at the White House on Wednesday.This type of meeting between the outgoing and incoming presidents is considered customary, but Mr Trump did not invite Mr Biden for one after making unsubstantiated election fraud claims that culminated in the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot.Mr Trump also broke with precedent by skipping Mr Bidens inauguration, but the White House has said Mr Biden will attend the upcoming ceremony.**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/10/donald-trump-arizona-win-swing-state-clean-sweep/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/10/donald-trump-arizona-win-swing-state-clean-sweep/)","title":"Donald Trump takes Arizona in swing state clean sweep"},{"text":"Oh but.

If the republicans had just filed claims in court, lost those claims, and went away, I would have been fine with that.  May have crowed a bit louder if it happened, but thats it.  Point being, I dont see how one relates asking questions to flat out election denying and violence.  If those questions are answered Id accept the answer no matter what.  But we have circumstantial evidence in the form of down ballot votes and early registration numbers that make them worth asking I think.","title":"Was it stolen?"},{"text":"Its been 4 days.

But the Biden economy has been great in many ways. The U.S. economy, wrote The Economist in mid-October, is the envy of the world. But in the right-wing media, the horror stories were relentless. And mainstream economic reporting too often followed that lead.","title":"Why Does No One Understand the Real Reason Trump Won?"},{"text":"Call the voters Stupid doesnt bring them to your side.

They do, however, also warn of the risk that, since \\"political enfranchisement remains as was C one person, one vote, at some point it is likely that labor will fight back against the rising profit share of the rich and there will be a political backlash against the rising wealth of the rich.\\"","title":"Trumps tariffs could tank the economy.

Historically, they're a very pro-labor part of the nation with strong historical ties to labor unions and other left-wing causes. So they're the heart of the working class in America. Now, if you're a voter there who sees Kamala Harris proudly showcasing the Cheney endorsements and other pro-corporate Republicans, considering the end result was Trump still getting the same number of votes but Harris got fewer, what do you think happened when people saw her running to the right? It didn't take away any Republican votes from Trump. But what do you suppose it did to the pro-worker, left-wing base of the Democrats? Do you suppose they were as enthusiastic to vote for her?Imo, I think if the candidate was someone like AOC, she probably could have won because she has very big working class appeal and younger vote appeal(which was a new group that Biden brought in last election that helped him win, which Harris also failed with.)

You can't stop the (diversity) rock. It will keep on rolling forward. It's inevitable. The racial-haters may have won a small battle, but they'll still lose the war. (I'm not sure when that will be.. but they will lose). The thing is, you can't stop immigration 100% (you can't stop BOTH illegal immigration and legal immigration). It's not like there's some magic forcefield to prevent people from coming into the country.THe Brookings Institute did a report that showed https://www.brookings.edu/articles/white-and-youth-population-losses-contributed-most-to-the-nations-growth-slowdown-new-census-data-reveals/ \\"This report focuses on annual changes from July 2016 to July 2017 through July 2020 to July 2021. This period includes three years prior to the pandemic, one year with partial pandemic exposure (2019 to 2020), and one year with full pandemic exposure (2020 to 2021). This allows for an assessment of race-ethnic and age shifts before and during the pandemic. This is also a significant period because, as a previous report shows, the nations white population began to decline in 2016.2 This initial white population loss occurred before the pandemic and is related to the aging of the white population, which has led to fewer births and more deathslosses that are projected to continue. And as shown below, the pandemic has exacerbated this white population loss.  The examination of age shifts shows a loss of young people under age 18 and those in their prime working ages (18 through 59). Moreover, when looking at age and race, it becomes clear that nonwhite Americans, especially Latino or Hispanic Americans, comprise larger shares of the population at all ages.  This report also revisits earlier analyses of notable population declines in large metro areas and big cities. It shows that most of those declines are due to white population losses, both from the national white population decline as well as white population movement to smaller-sized places. While these trends are exaggerated in the prime pandemic year, it is plain to see that **the nation is facing a long-term transition toward greater diversity and aging, both nationally and across large swaths of the country. **Latino, Asian and Black demographics are all growing faster than White.  \\"The new census estimates make plain two facts: 1) diversity is greater for the nations younger age groups than older age groups; and 2) the nation is becoming more diverse at all ages. \\"","title":"Donald Trump has just unmasked the awkward truth about diversity: It was obvious a long time ago that the Democratic nominee wasnt up for the job.

Im sure there are some that can be scrapped, but they intend to reduce externalities, which can increase costs themselves. Rarely is zero sum. Doubt regulatory rollback would have a massive effect but could be wrong.The Fed uses rates to control inflation. Inflation has been easing and rates have been cut. Decreasing rates when not necessary is inflationary. Domestic oil production has already hit record levels since 2023 and the US has led production globally for 6 years.So a lot of that has already happened or been happening. Corporate profits are at all-time highs. The market is at all-time highs.Not making a political argument here, more saying if these policies would truly reduce prices the way wed hope, that hasnt been happening. Can point to global inflation as a result of the pandemic as the biggest culprit, but the POTUS doesnt have a magic lever and Im doubtful that Trump policy will change that.

Democrat lies are provable - categorically Trump has been mischaracterised - while Republican lies aren't easy to say yes that was definitely this or that cos of the rampant denial and continual fuck-ups. Democrats try to be honest and professional, but they are proven liars.However, what's interesting is the same logic regarding tangibility doesn't happen with all the other claims about democrats which are just he said/she said. Election fraud? Non-tangible. Pro-baby execution? Non-tangible and mischaracterisation. Kamala running on trans rights? Non-tangible and mischaracterisation. Cats and dogs? Non-tangible. Open borders? Non-tangible and mischaracterisation. Communist? Non-tangible and mischaracterisation.Basically Dems can't use anecdotal or probability based evidence, but Republicans can. Democrats can't say it didn't happen that way, but Republicans can. Democrats can't mischaracterise something Trump did (tbf, they ABSOLUTE SHOULD NOT HAVE) but Republicans can mischaracterise DemsIt's especially frustrating that people just don't believe in possibility.

Governor: We absolutely need to tackle pollution to make sure we continue being able to live; in order to do that, we need to make sure Americans have the means to afford goods and services which help us all do so, which means we need to get wages and salaries growing faster in this country but, more urgently, we need to make sure Americans are better able to put food on their tables, keep roofs over their heads, and afford the medical care they need to be able to not only survive but also thrive.

I think Biden figured that if he could just beat him again, problem solved, and there wouldn't be a bunch of angry domestic terrorists out looking for targets.  He's maybe right that that would have happened if Trump had been prosecuted properly and sent to jail.  He also may have reasoned that jailing Trump might make him a martyr and the GOP might win the election on that, pardon him, and do all the same stuff anyway and it wouldn't matter.  Maybe he's right about that also.3)  Hubris.  I really think Biden figured, hey I kicked this guy's ass, he's not so tough.  I can do it again.  Maybe he could have if he'd been 5 years younger.

The spam campaign email was trying to leverage the Afghanistan withdrawal for campaign donations. A billionaire is asking people that are struggling financially to send *him* money!?

An additional 2.3 million removable immigrants were released into the United States between January 2023 and April 2024 and would also be targeted in any mass deportation operation.\\n* A one-time operation to deport these immigrants would cost at least $315 billion, broken down as follows:\\n    * The government would have to spend $89.3 billion to conduct sufficient arrests.\\n    * The government would have to spend $167.8 billion to detain immigrants en masse.\\n    * The government would have to spend $34.1 billion on legal processing.\\n    * The government would have to spend $24.1 billion on removals.\\n* Deporting one million immigrants per year would incur an annual cost of $88 billion, with the majority of that cost going towards building detention camps. It would take over ten years,  and the building of hundreds to thousands of new detention facilities, to arrest, detain, process, and remove all 13.3 million targeted immigrantseven assuming that 20 percent of that population would depart voluntarily during any multi-year mass deportation effort. The total cost over 10.6 years (assuming an annual inflation rate of 2.5 percent) would be $967.9 billion. The annual costs would break down as follows:\\n    * The government would have to spend an average of $7 billion per year to conduct one million arrests annually.\\n    * The government would have to spend an average of $66 billion per year to detain one million immigrants annually, or surveil them on alternatives to detention programs while detention capacity ramps up to one million.\\n    * The government would have to spend an average of $12.6 billion per year to carry out legal processing for an average of one million immigrants annually.\\n    * The government would have to spend an average of $2.1 billion per year to remove one million immigrants annually.\\n* To carry out over 13 million arrests in a short period of time would require somewhere between 220,000 and 409,000 new government employees and law enforcement officers, which would be nearly impossible given current hiring challenges across law enforcement agencies. Even carrying out one million at-large arrests per year would require ICE to hire over 30,000 new law enforcement agents and staff, instantly making it the largest law enforcement agency in the federal government.\\n* Mass deportation would exacerbate the U.S. labor shortage. In 2022, nearly 90 percent of undocumented immigrants were of working age, compared to 61.3 percent of the U.S.-born population aged between 16 and 64, making undocumented immigrants more likely to actively participate in the labor force. Losing these working-age undocumented immigrants would worsen the severe workforce challenges that many industries have already been struggling with in the past few years.\\n* Mass deportation would hurt several key U.S. industries that rely heavily on undocumented workers. The construction and agriculture industries would lose at least one in eight workers, while in hospitality, about one in 14 workers would be deported due to their undocumented status. Among those industries, certain trades would be hit even harder. Mass deportation would remove more than 30 percent of the workers in major construction trades, such as plasterers, roofers, and painters; nearly 28 percent of graders and sorters of agriculture products; and a fourth of all housekeeping cleaners.\\n* Among the deported would be 1 million undocumented immigrant entrepreneurs, who generated $27.1 billion in total business income in 2022. Losing the 157,800 undocumented immigrant entrepreneurs in neighborhood businesses would lead to disruptions to services that have become an integral part of community life and provide local jobs for Americans.**\\n* The U.S. would lose out on key contributions undocumented households make to social safety net programs annually, including $22.6 billion to Social Security and $5.7 billion to Medicare. As the U.S. population ages, the loss of these payments would make it increasingly challenging to keep social safety net programs solvent.**\\n* Mass deportation would deprive federal, state, and local governments of billions in local tax contributions from undocumented households. In 2022 alone, undocumented immigrant households paid $46.8 billion in federal taxes and $29.3 billion in state and local taxes. After taxes, they were left with $256.8 billion in spending power, money that could be spent in local communities.**\\n* Deporting undocumented immigrants would separate 4 million mixed-status families, affecting 8.5 million U.S. citizens with undocumented family members (5.1 million of whom are U.S. citizen children). It would slash the income of their households by an average of 62.7 percent ($51,200 per year).\\n* Overall, mass deportation would lead to a loss of 4.2 percent to 6.8 percent of annual U.S. GDP, or $1.1 trillion to $1.7 trillion in 2022 dollars. In comparison, the U.S. GDP shrunk by 4.3 percent during the Great Recession between 2007 and 2009.**\\n* The negative impact would be the most significant in California, Texas, and Florida, the three states that were home to 47.2 percent of the country's undocumented immigrants in 2022 and where one in every 20 residents would be deported.","title":"Trump on Day 1: Begin deportation push, pardon Jan. 6 rioters and make his criminal cases vanish"},{"text":"Throughout her tour, she's been donating revenue from concerts to specific organizations, many of them focused on women's rights and health","title":"Olivia Rodrigo removes song from TikTok after Trump campaign uses it in victory video"},{"text":"I dont agree with alot of what Christie says but hes not stupid and when he was Gov of NJ during Sandy he actually got help to people that needed it.","title":"Frustrated Americans await the economic changes they voted for with Trump"},{"text":"She's such an ass kisser so I'm surprised she decided to trash talk Trump before the election, knowing this might be the result","title":"Donald Trump Says He Wont Invite Nikki Haley, Mike Pompeo to Join Administration"},{"text":"Im doing my own research.","title":"Billionaire Mark Cuban Warns Trump's Tariff Plan Already Hurting American Businesses"},{"text":"Conservatives around the world.

Society exists on a spectrum. The left is incredibly vocal about many issues they find important, and many of those issues are important. An example I can think of is the Harris interview where she said she believes that inmates have gender confirming care. It was clipped and used in commercials that ran basically every half hour here in PA. Three interview absolutely helped Trump more than Harris. I think that local leaders in blue areas and administrative personnel should absolutely be explicit in their support of trans people. However, people that need swing voters need to use implicit language. \\"Every person deserves the right to access the healthcare they need\\" wouldn't have been clipped, for example. We're losing the culture war. In order to protect these groups we need to change our marketing tactics to attract the center rather than the group itself. That's especially true when we're just doubling down on votes already secured. Over emphasizing the acquisition of one block of voters can end in losing another.","title":"Trans Issues, Elections, and the Democrats"},{"text":"IMO it was the egos of the journalists who pushed him out through headlines 100 days from the election.

There were at least two VERY significant legal questions that needed a SCOTUS ruling before that case would be sufficiently resolved. The first is whether or not the President has plenary power concerning clarification and whether or not any prices must be followed. The prevailing idea pre-Trump was that yes, the power is absolute and no, the President can declassify anything on a whim at any time. This is why Obama can declassify extremely TS/SCI information on live television and not be in trouble. (And that absolutely happened in the aftermath of the bin Laden raid). The DOJ was bringing very novel and completely untested legal theories that would seem to conflict with previous SCOTUS rulings, including one that brings us to the second point: presidential vs personal records. The National Records Act may be unconstitutional in its face, but at a minimum, the issue of who has final say over presidential records designations needs to be hammered out. Ideally, Congress would clarify with an amendment to existing law, but absent that, SCOTUS would absolutely need to arbitrate between NARA's position and Trump's position. There's no obvious reason why NARA should have the final say, not in the law itself and not from any practical perspective either. TLDR: the government case against Trump was novel, untested, and highly unlikely to survive SCOTUS scrutiny.","title":"CMV: American Democracy is Over"},{"text":"Thanks for this.

Most people are going to vote selfishly they will not vote for some greater good concept that does not make their life easier. That is simply a fact you cannot change people who want things to be a certain way in our promised it through campaigning whether they get it or not to vote differently. \\nThe Democratic Party did not change their platform to represent the ongoing complaints that people have. Texas and California have ongoing illegal immigration problems for different reasons people feel these problems on a ground level people who vote Democratic do not usually vote on ground level issues they vote on national issues that no other Republican will care about. The Democratic Party did not change their platform on Helene did not change their platform on the economy and the the rise of prices regardless of which administration was the reason for the prices. People in 2017-2018-2019 had low prices and gas was affordable and the Trump administration just happened to be there they will vote for the Trump administration again because they want that economy and they believe that that's what they're going to get because that's what being promised on a ground level issue to most American voters. The Democratic Party's platform did not change fast enough nor did they use the opportunity to actually host Democratic primaries in a way where other candidates can propose a platform that will resonate with the public. You as an individual voter should not feel entitled enough to say that other people do not understand the point of voting because the point of voting is to be self it is the only selfish thing you can do in the country freely is vote for your needs and vote for your wants whether you're going to get them or not. This isn't a messaging issue This is not a giant group of people that just dislike women okay This is a group of people who are centrists conservatives and Republicans being able to use a marketable man for ground level issues that matter to the public and get them to vote that way The Democrats did not do this they drove everyone away with their was there platform Biden had terrible messaging and had terrible everything when it came to him campaigning and the only reason he won was because he was not Trump. There's a quote that hard times make good men good men make easy times and easy times make lazy men This can be applied to men and women we had good times in 2017-2018-2019 with prices we have then since gone through in the last 5 years natural disasters and an epidemic and daring that whole time people were unable to make as much money as 2018-2019 and then had prices increase states who aren't budgeting lower their budget for things like EBT and unemployment make it really hard for people to make money back so they are voting on ground level issues so that they can see themselves see more money whether they're going to get that or not The Democratic Party did not use that insight with their platforms Yes you can say that it's a messaging issue but Democratic Party has always had a poor messaging issue they've always been just anti-republican there's never been a platform and the last 20 something years that wasn't just anti My running opponent. I think if you really want to understand why people voted for Donald Trump in such a huge amount it's because we are facing a point where the middle class is getting poorer. And the majority of voters are not blaming the rich The only people that are blaming the rich is the Democratic Party nobody cares about the rich and their money. They care about their money their taxes their food costs who's going to help make it better who's going to campaign for their wants and their needs not the greater good nobody is going to accept a greater good message when you can't sell the product.","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"Yes, so much for the notion that Kamala would win a very close race.","title":"AP Calls Arizona For Donald Trump - Most Electoral Votes For A Republican Since 1988"},{"text":"Yep, common decency is indeed dead.

The court also made it clear that it was solely in the hands of the state. abortion is a matter to be decided by states and the voters in the states. We hold, he wrote, that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion. As to what standard the courts should apply in the event that a state regulation is challenged, Alito said any state regulation of abortion is presumptively valid and must be sustained if there is a rational basis on which the legislature could have thought it was serving legitimate state interests, including respect for and preservation of prenatal life at all stages of development. In addition, he noted, states are entitled to regulate abortion to eliminate gruesome and barbaric medical procedures; to preserve the integrity of the medical profession; and to prevent discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or disability, including barring abortion in cases of fetal abnormality. The supremacy clause of the constitution makes conflicting state laws subordinate to federal law. But the federal government can only pass laws in pursuit to the constitution and their enumerated powers. States couldnt make abortion illegal because Roe V Wade said abortion was protected under the 14th amendment. Now that it is not protected, and the supreme courts ruling, made it more clear, it is solely a states right to decide. A federal abortion ban has no constitutional grounds, and I dont see what in the constitution would allow a national ban to supersede state laws. They would have to get the Supreme Court to determine a fetus as person from conception or something.","title":"They split the ticket.

A lot of people were upset with how blatantly she was throwing LGBT people under the bus for those undecideds.

(We might regard a temporary loss of autonomy as a degree of damage to her selfhood, but not complete elimination.) But abortion not only damages someone's body but also completely destroys their nascent selfhood. Equally valuing the bodily integrity and selfhood of each party therefore requires protection of the fetus, who stands to be more harmed.It seems like you are especially vulnerable to this because you allow that \\"the fetus...deserves the same rights as me.\\" My own rationale for early abortion denies that: \\"no brain, no self, no rights\\".","title":"They split the ticket.

There is actually bipartisan support to start opening up lands for development, with a key difference being the Dems push for guaranteed low cost housing options.  Planning and anger aside, millions of Americans choked out by sky-high housing prices voted for Trump because the current economy has left them in the dust.If you dont like oil/gas, I get you.  But if you think land conversion on a MASSIVE scale wasnt a plan under Biden I have really bad news for youit absolutely was.  Solar and wind projects on BLM land was a massive policy. Here is a reality check for some, both the green side and the utilization side of land management issues really focus on one thing.  That one thing is money.  The green side? Absolutely!  Fun fact, agreements with these groups requires a 16-20% administrative rake.  So if you give TNC $1.0mill, their overhead is taking $200k.  That takes a nastier look when you see the salaries of high level TNC management.  Ranching, timber, OnG, and developers will get a lot of wins under Trump.  The EAJA machine will take them to court for years.  This time Trump will likely ask agencies to push forward and ignore court orders (thats the scary piece, on all fronts!).  The end result will be minor changes. In some regards those minor changes will have massive impacts, and that is tragic.Running around talking about nature being a church, or other arguments that DO NOT relate to average Americans is 100% why we have a second Trump term.

Trump would have destroyed Biden too, though. Not all registered Democrats voted for her, either. And even the other candidates had all-time low turnouts. Trump is obviously the people's choice.      \\nHow did the Democrats not have ANY other more popular candidates? Their party is deep in the shitter. Nancy Pelosi, Biden and Harris are the face of the Democratic party? I think we've seen a shift, a display of karma, and a nationwide response to the last four years...and the backbreaking straw for many decades of lies that have made citizens either feel duped, or nothing but contempt for the established government.        \\nAnd many of you were scared Trump wouldn't win. Especially down the stretch in the days leading up to the election. I told you to have faith. But I already knew many blacks, hispanics and cuckhold man-wives who had voted for Trump. Many didn't advertise to their family and friends out of fear of exclusion. Some kept it from their liberal, controlling spouses. And in conjunction with all the registered Democrats who were flipping, it made up the far greater percentage of voters that I know. And this is in the very blue state and city of nyc. Unfortunately, many naive students and young people here voted for Harris. They make up the majority of Harris' voters...stupid, inexperienced, brainwashed and indoctrinated kids, essentially. Some of the once young (dumbass) supporters of Obama and Biden, had since grown up and became aware, which gives me some hope that not everyone is asleep. If Trump only had six more terms, this place could totally be straightened out.    \\nAs a priveleged journalist for 30+ years, I know a few things about Trump many do not, and his true feelings behind some of his actions. He is a lot more sensitive and considerate than even his own supporters are aware of. It's like a Christmas present, with a story behind it that reveals the sacrifice of which the giver endured to gift such a valuable and rare item. It's more than just a gesture to win stereotypical support. The Democrats are getting a lot of what they didn't know that they really wanted with Trump. For the obvious example: a mother spared the grief of living with having had an abortion. One can't know until they experience it. Then they are either filled with soul-damaging regret for having gone through with it, or immense gratitude for not...both which are permanent. Trump essentially will have saved many from themselves. No, he's not Jesus. But he will apply his own policy to help even Democrats. They should be grateful. I know some who are grateful that they voted for him.

A month later she softened up, she started conveying herself as a completely standard liberal/neolib politician, and by the first debate in September it was obvious nothing would change in her agenda compared to Biden. After the debate, she started trotting out all the Republican exiles, started talking about her guns, stopped talking about project 2025 or agenda 47 entirely, stopped really advocating for \\"controversial\\" issues like trans rights in efforts to court undecideds, refused to diverge from the US's current stance on israel/gaza when pressed, and hardly any of the messaging on her unique policies landed. All that for voters who stayed loyal to trump anyways rather than her base. It felt like there was no touchstone policy for people to latch onto, like for example, Trump's border wall in 2016, or Biden's student loan forgiveness. The closest was saying that she would advocate for medicare 4 all, but it didn't seem like she was a staunch supporter that would do everything in her power to get that for America. Outside of that, she focused on celebrity endorsements a lot and legacy democrat names to campaign for her, and I just don't think that the standard neolib affair really does it for voters anymore.The people want a fighter, someone who'll actually confront America's issues and push back against corporate interests &amp; conservatism, not the folks who papered over 2008 and continually allow corporate ratfucking. That whole weird campaign, that looked like maybe someone in the democrat party was ready to roll up their sleeves and play in the mud, but ultimately no, she resorted to the same playbook of \\"we go low they go high\\" and bowed to the same corporate elitist interests and the voters didn't even get out of bed.","title":"After Trump wins on a campaign rife with anti-trans ads, LGBTQ people flood crisis hotlines"},{"text":"But more importantly, look and listen to what Trump is claiming he is going to do while in office and compare how that aligns with project 2025 youll find that about the only thing that is different between his plan and p25 is his claim that he wouldnt sign a bill banning abortions nationwideObjectively not true.

You counter, no the Biden switched to a Trump and he gained new voters. I disagree with this, at least not to the extent that would have mattered. Trump gained new voters sure, but would need citation that those voters had voted for Biden in 2020 and not just raw new voters. It is also a fact that Biden voters sat out and didnt vote for Harris.

For too long now, people of the middle and lower class, especially in rural areas, have voted for Republicans again and again, while they have destroyed any efforts actually helping those people - but the propaganda arm of those asshats news media was so strong brainwashing them into believing that republicans are there them. So now Im taking a different approach: Im very hopeful that Trump does what he said he will do. Massive tariffs, so everything gets more expensive. Destroying unions, so there is no one who can fight for workers rights. End of regulations, so worksafety, healthcare and the environment for recreation just gets worse. The denaturalization and deportation of billions, so the economy tanks (unless counties child workers fill the gap in low paid shitty jobs.) Musks 2 trillion budget cut, so social security, ACA and much more gets shafted. All of it will kill the market and create a Great Depression, destroying 401k. The housing market will crash, people on mortgage will lose their home.There are a lot of people who are afraid of the damage being done. Im not. I hope the democrats wont stand in the way, so that the damage done will be massive. If its not, the damage will be so little, that people look back and say: But the trains ran on time!

When Republicans controlled all three branches under the much hated (by the left) Bush, no dictatorship.

You, and everyone else on the left, seems to think that Trump came onto the scene and implanted his views into peoples heads, and thats why they support him; as if theyd all have  left wing ideas and opinions otherwise. While the democrat machine is a top down structure, where the machine tells people what to think and believe, thats not whats going on with Trump. There are people who dont want to be told what to think and make up their own minds, based on what they actually see going on.People already had ideas and opinions, concerns and worries, and Trump came on the scene, and actually spoke to these things. Both parties had pretty much been ignoring these things for a long time. There is a lot more that can be said about what happened, but Im tired of typing, and I doubt anyone will actually think about what Ive said. Im sure Im just going to get a lot of hate ( and thats also something that killed her campaign, but thats for a different discussion altogether). But, I do want to make one final point. There are a lot of people who dont trust the main stream media, and that number is growing as people keep seeing how we are being lied to them. Those people dont just believe the BS they are told to believe, by MSM and the DNC. They go look for actual sources and uncut and edited footage of what happened and what was said. Biden/Harris and the DNC have been blatantly lying, to push their agenda, since Trump announced he was running for the 2016 election. All you have to do is look for the actual truth and the uncut and unedited footage on the internet; which is one of the reasons the DNC is now saying free speech is a threat. They want to control what you can say and what you can hear, because they want their truth to be all you get to hear. They constantly rail against misinformation, when they are the biggest pushers of misinformation. Two good examples are the good people on both sides Trump is a racist rhetoric, and the recent Trump is calling for Liz Chaney to be shot by a firing squad rhetoric. They cut the footage to make it look like he might have been saying what they claim he said, and then push those claims, using this edited footage. Thats utterly dishonest. There is also all the lies about what Trump is going to do ( and also about what Harris policy values are  ( as compared to what she previously stated they were )).Video footage of what he actually has said, and the history of what he actually did do, are easy to find on the internet. MSM and the DNC are not the only possible sources of information, people actually do have memories. The party claims of what Trump was going to do have been ridiculous ( and totally false ), and have only gotten worse. Not only the obvious lies about project 2025 or his intention to ban abortions on the federal level, but stuff like Harris telling people he was going to put them in camps, at her rallies. The irony of that last point is amazing, since AOC actually said they ( the Dems ) should put conservatives in reeducation camps!","title":"CMV: Trump's victory was primarily a Democratic party messaging failure, and people are going to take away the wrong lessons if they don't grasp that."},{"text":"The EU has stepped up a lot.

The US has also supplied a whole lot of armaments and ammunition to keep the occupiers at bay. Had it not been for the US, the war would most likely have been lost years ago. And so you might ask, why should Americans even care. Well it is because Russia is also threatening other European countries including your allies. The fear is that if Putin is successful in Ukraine it might give him new ideas. For example trying to attack a NATO country. And if that happens, NATO and the US will have to make a difficult choice.
