Funding stream \\"A\\" is assessed payments for member nations - essentially the dues we agreed to pay to be part of the WHO. In that part of money, the US is currently number one in the low 20%s of total assessed payments, China is about 12%, and Japan is about 7%. This is the total percent paid of these direct mandatory government payments to WHO, and China is the second nation in payments to WHO. Funding stream \\"B\\" Is donations from non-governmental organizations and private donors, independent of what governments pay. The Gates Foundation is one of the largest of these NGO contributors.  It turns out that this funding stream is the majority of WHO income, by a significant margin. They get much more money from donations from NGOs and private individuals, thsn they do assessed payments from member nations. It turns out that a lot of these NGO contributors are from the United States, and from Germany. If you include all of that non-governmental contribution as United States contributions, it increases our percentage of total funding - If you attribute those NGO and private donations to the United States. Germany is also near the top of total funding, if you include NGO and private donations and attribute them to Germany, Even though Germany's government assessment is a pretty low percentage of the WHO's total assessed income. China has very few NGOs and private donors giving money to the WHO, so if you lump government assessments, with private and NGO contributions by nation, \\"China\\" is only 2-3% of total WHO funding.

I was absolutely glued to the account of this one reporter on Twitter who was frequently giving updates on the situation, and at one point even said that this one woman was possibly going to keep Kavanaugh from being confirmed, even though it was actually pretty obvious in hindsight that Flake was just trying to score bipartisan brownie points and likely never intended to change his vote (see also: Collins, Susan).

He added that Ms. Boylands death was caused by an accidental overdose.In the days and weeks after the riot, five police officers who had served at the Capitol on Jan. 6 died.Officer Brian D. Sicknick of the Capitol Police, who was attacked by the mob, died on Jan. 7.Officer Jeffrey Smith of the Metropolitan Police Department killed himself after the attack.Officer Howard S. Liebengood of the Capitol Police also died by suicide four days afterward.The Capitol Police had previously said that Officer Sicknick died from injuries sustained while physically engaging with protesters. The Washington medical examiner later ruled that he had died of natural causes: multiple strokes that occurred hours after Officer Sicknicks confrontation with the mob. The medical examiner added, however, that all that transpired played a role in his condition.A bipartisan Senate report, released in June, found that the seven deaths were connected to the Capitol attack. But the report was issued a month before two Metropolitan Police officers  Gunther Hashida and Kyle DeFreytag  died by suicide in July.The police agencies have not classified the four total suicides as line of duty deaths that would provide the victims families with enhanced benefits. Washington law excludes suicide deaths from the line-of-duty designation.About 150 officers from the Capitol Police, the Metropolitan Police Department and local agencies were injured, and hundreds of workers were traumatized by the mob.In its final report, the House select committee investigating Jan. 6 could mention an official death toll from the violence.Democratic lawmakers have sought to include the police suicides as deaths that occurred in connection with Jan. 6. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, said on Twitter in October that the Capitol riot was a terror attack that left almost 10 dead, a toll that apparently included the four suicides.Other Democratic members of Congress have lobbied for the police suicides to be designated as line-of-duty deaths. Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, and Representatives Jennifer Wexton and Donald S. Beyer Jr., all Democrats of Virginia, wrote to Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington in October asking that Officer Smith be granted a line-of-duty death designation.Officer Jeffrey Smith was a mentally healthy person who received a blow to the head, began to exhibit symptoms he had never exhibited before, and nine days later died by suicide, the lawmakers letter said.

What you are thinking of as antifa is just a loosely organized group of anarchists, radical political activists, opportunists, and some bad faith actors who jump at the chance of confronting another group and/or create chaos. To actually believe that the Democratic Party or any democratic politician can give them orders is ridiculous. Lets say you wanted to join this so called antifa army you wouldnt even know where to begin. Its because its not an army. Just a random group of people looking to confront radical right wing groups at best or bad faith actors looking to cause havoc and chaos at worst.","title":"Private Militias"},{"text":"It's like you didn't read a single word of my comment","title":"Trumps UN ambassador pick says Israel has biblical right to West Bank"},{"text":"This reminds me of Fanily Guy episode where it's revealed that Carter Pewterschmidt and the other ultra-rich have discovered a fast and effective cure for cancer, and they're hiding it from the masses.Brian: \\"Carter, this is the holy grail of medicine!

I think, and I'm being as forgiving l as I can here, that it means that at conception the organism that will eventually produce those particular reproductive cells are either male or female. Not that they are producing them at conception. Tying it to the production of sperm and eggs though is also an odd choice because some men have azoospermia (cannot produce sperm) so according to this they aren't men and some women are anovulatory (can't produce eggs) and therefore aren't women. Tying it chromosomes might have been a little better but there's chromosomal differences too like Kilnefelter syndrome in which a presumptive male has XXY chromosomes. So maybe we should tie it to hormones or other physical features... But then we get issues like Androgen insensitivity syndrome in which an genetically XY person doesn't react to testosterone (androgens) and develops as a female. They'll be genetically male but will have a vagina and develop breasts but won't have a uterus or have eggs so... under Trump these genetic males who look, likely feel, and have been raised as females are just confused dudes...\\n  \\nI guess I don't have a good answer.

Its 10% on everything in the value chain, so finished products will be less than 10% more because not everything will be coming from China. Moreover, prices are sticky, so the effects will take some time to ramp up and hit equilibrium, during which time structural changes might occur such that we begin importing similar inputs from other countries, even if theyre originally from China (which would give a less than 10% markup as developing countries substitute their labor value by less than the cost of Chinas + 10%).But to be clear, the whole thing is a bag of shit, and no serious economist thinks this is a good move. Unions in dying industries are the only ones who think this is a good idea, and they happen to be in the most important voting bloc in the most important swing states.

Im the only one that has cited data and statistics, you have cited nothing  so **you** are the one who is not dealing with reality and facts.Secondly, you are **once again missing the point**. The point is that **Trump voters voted for him because he promised to lower food prices, yet he once again lied and his policies are going to cause them to skyrocket**. You know we are right, and thats why you are desperately trying to change the subject to how we view immigrants. The topic of discussion is not about how we view immigrants, its about how Trump is fucking over the American people by lying about lowering food prices and instead causing them to skyrocket. Personally, Id rather keep the immigrants **and** pay them a living wage, Id have no problem paying more for food as well if it meant those immigrants had a better life. But no, Trump is going to make the lives of those immigrants worse by deporting them and well have to pay more for food anyways.

It doesn't make sense to apply it to undocumented immigrants, and there's no legal precedent for that.One weird thing about that is that it seems to imply that those people can break the law with impunity in the US.

It's estimated that the attack exceeded $2.8 million in damages. Over 140 police officers were assaulted that day. Evidence shows that rioters used firearms, tasers, chemical and makeshift weapons like bear spray, flagpoles and baseball bats.One Capitol police officer, Brian Sicknick, died of a stroke after being hospitalized for injuries he sustained from the rioters. Multiple officers committed suicide days after the attack. While many more suffered from psychological trauma and physical injuries.Let's not forget the chants of \\"hang Mike Pence\\" as the mob was storming the Capitol halls.Imagine for a moment what would have happened if these people actually got their hands on a congressman. A situation that Republicans would rather you *don't* imagine.What's more, several organized, far right extremist groups were involved in the attack. Including the Proud Boys, The Oath Keepers, The Three Percenters, followers of Qanon, along with several neo-Nazi groups.And despite this, January 6th downplayers have repeatedly referred to these violent participants as \\"political hostages.\\"Some Republicans, including GOP leaders themselves, have threatened to investigate and jail those on the investigative committee. Members of the investigation have also received threats of violence. This is the *real* \\"weaponization of the justice system.\\"We all know this is another retaliation from the MAGA crowd that's trying desperately to discredit Trump's opponents and absolve Trump and his violent followers of all wrongdoing.They not only refuse to hold him responsible for his crimes and misconduct, but also try continuously to make him and his supporters out to be the victims of this attack. Here's the simple fact, if you take Trump out of the equation, January 6th never happens.For months leading up to the election, Trump promoted election denying lies, conspiracy theories and misinformation. Trump's inflammatory rhetoric, his false claims, his refusal to concede his loss, his efforts to disrupt the transfer of power, his violence inciting remarks, and his invitation to his supporters helped facilitate the events of January 6th. He is predominantly responsible for what transpired on that day.The subsequent investigation showed that many Trump supporters did, in fact, bring weapons with them to the Capitol. However, the magnetometers prevented the horde from bringing some of those weapons with them into the grounds and rally area.Testimony revealed that Donald Trump knew about these weapons. Trump reportedly claimed that his supporters weren't \\"here to hurt him,\\" and that they should \\"take the fucking mags away,\\" he continued, \\"let my people in, they can march to the Capitol from here. Let the people in, take the fucking mags away.\\"The investigation also revealed Trump's inaction as events were unfolding. It was reported that for 187 minutes, Trump refused to take any public action to stop the violence.During this time, Trump was watching the events unfold on television from his private dining room next to the oval office. It was concluded that Trump chose *not* to stop it.Barry Loudermilk's recent report attacking the Jan 6th investigation blames Nancy Pelosi for what happened. A common talking point among conservatives.These claims are not supported by the facts. Pelosi did not have the authority to activate the National Guard, this power lies with the president, The Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the army.In fact, records show that Pelosi approved a previous request for National Guard support, and continued pushing for their deployment when delays occurred.Yet still, the MAGA movement continues to scapegoat Democrats and \\"radical leftist\\" groups, while whitewashing the events of that day and promoting January 6th conspiracy theories. Instead of holding Trump accountable, Republicans have targeted members of the Jan 6th investigation, Liz Cheney in particular: What caused the third-highest-ranking member of the House Republican Conference, a woman on track to be House Speaker or perhaps more, to turn against an honest and true man like Donald Trump and commit terrible crimes against MAGA? What exactly happened at the Capitol on Jan. 6 that exposed the security failures?These rhetorical questions serve only to direct blame away from Trump and reinforce far right conspiracy theories.The Wyoming GOP censured Cheney for her participation in the investigation and later made a statement promoting some of these deranged theories. In its February 2021 complaint against Cheney, the Wyoming state GOP noted that ample video evidence suggests the riot at the capital was instigated by Antifa and BLM radicals.Republicans, including Trump himself, have latched onto these \\"false flag\\" narratives, doing everything they can to direct attention away from the violence committed by these MAGA extremists.Republicans also claim that Hutchinson was a tampered witness and her claims were unsubstantiated because she refused to take counsel from her MAGA-funded lawyer.Trump called Hutchinson a \\"total phony\\" and \\"leaker\\" because she spoke out against him. Their case against Hutchinson is based simply on Republicans not liking what she had to say.The January 6 investigation also revealed the following: - Donald Trump conspired to overturn the election, took actions to \\"defraud the United States\\" and disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans.  \\n- He also attempted to install loyalists into positions of power within the DOJ, including Jeffrey Clark, who would support his unfounded claims of election fraud and try to use the power of the justice department to overturn the election results. Justice officials threatened to resign if Clark was given the position. \\n- Trump also pressured state officials to change the outcome of the election in their states.  \\n- Trump and his allies attempted a fake elector scheme designed to generate and submit slates of fake electors In several key states to replace the legitimate electors certified by those states.  \\n- He also pressured and intimidated Mike Pence to reject the certified electoral votes in Congress.The evidence is clear. No matter what lengths  Republicans will go to in order to minimize what happened, January 6th was a day of destruction and violence. A day that should have lived on in infamy. A day of seditious rioting fomented by Donald Trump and carried out by his radical followers.

Wasn't aware of that. I was aware, however, of the fact that he is close friends with Russian oligarchs/mafia leaders such as Semion Mogilevich (as a go between for the CIA), money launderers (Wilbur Ross), arms traffickers, and human traffickers (not just Jeff Epstein, but Roy Cohn, who Trump considered a father figure).I could pull on any of these threads, but Semion Mogilevich is especially interesting considering that his connection to the Bank of New York, which hid transactions in excess of 100B USD in the days following 9/11 amid the chaos. Some people know of the DoD \\"losing financial records\\" because the \\"plane\\" crashed into the Pentagon, but very few people know the BoNY was reporting losses of $100B despite not sustaining any structural damage during the \\"attack\\" and national security rules governing financial transactions were briefly lifted after 9/11 while this bank was able to launder its \\"losses\\" away. It's estimated that 40-50% of Russia was bought up by the mafia by '92-'93, funded by CIA money, probably through black operations like the drug trade in Latin America (Ollie North being a fall guy for one of these operations).

No more open enrollment B.S.  there is zero reason why health insurance can't be like car insurance, easy and abundant.  Mandate upfront open pricing on common or normal procedures.  There's no competition in pricing because nobody knows what the pricing is.

Several will require police-state tactics.During his 2024 campaign, Trump repeatedly and enthusiastically declared he would order the mass deportation of 11 million or so undocumented immigrants. At his rallies, diehard fans excitedly waved signs proclaiming the slogan they chanted: MASS DEPORTATION NOW!Such a program would require deploying a paramilitary forceor even the National Guard or the militaryto locate migrants, apprehend them, and guard them in a network of prisons and detention camps. (Executives at private prison, security, and surveillance software companies are already salivating.)This system would depend on ramping up monitoring of workplaces and neighborhoods, and on anonymous tip lines susceptible to abuse and false leads. Have a problem with a neighbor? Report em. Perhaps the forces rounding up migrants will be afforded special powers to evade civil liberties protections.Months before he left office at the end of his first term, Trump issued an executive order that would have removed employment protections from civil servants deemed disloyal to the president that could have required expressions of allegiance before being hiredin other words, loyalty oaths for Trump.The order created a new employment category called Schedule F, to be applied to perhaps tens of thousands of federal workers (maybe more), permitting them to be fired without cause.President Joe Biden rescinded the order upon entering the White House and, in October, his administration issued final rules aimed at preventing a future president from reinstating it.Trump vowed to bring the plan back on day one and turn a large section of the federal workforce into a Trump corpsa stated goal of Steve Bannon &amp; other MAGA schemers. Reviving Schedule F would be a direct threat to our national security and our governments ability to functionUnder such a regime, a broad range of federal employeessay, lawyers at the EPA who work on climate change, scientists at the CDC who prepare for pandemics, or analysts at the CIA who watch the Kremlincould be dumped at will if they raise questions about a Trump position or dont pay him obeisance.?

The NLRB general counsel prosecutes unfair labor practices, and presidents historically have respected the offices four-year term. During the Trump administration, Richard Griffin, a Democrat appointed by Obama, served for nine months, until his term expired.

The Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected the governments claim to an unchecked system of global detention, and the district court should similarly reject the administrations claim here to an unchecked system of global targeted killing.I do think this wrong.

For those out of the loop, here is a basic rundown of the arguements being made.Trump signed an Exectutive Order that would apply to people born 30 days from its signing. It will not apply retroactively. Citizenship is governed by the 14th Amendment which says, \\"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\\" Trump's arguement and order hinge on that \\"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\\" language. Trump's order says that when neither parent is a US citizen, and the mother is either here illegally or temporarily, the child is not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and therefore not a citizen. Opponents of the order argue that the jurisdiction language is meant to refer to the children of diplomats or children of foreign parents occupying part of the US during a hypothetical invasion.Most legal scholar seems to think the order is a blatant violation of the 14th Amendment and that it will be overturned in courts, even while factoring in the current 6-3 conservative majority on SCOTUS.Edit: Clarified opening line.","title":"18 states sue Trump administration over order seeking to overturn birthright citizenship"},{"text":"Could it be that she doesnt know what she got herself into?

And sure enough, it came...The so called \\"federal hiring plan,\\" which is just one step towards restructuring the government to fulfill the agendas and interests of one party. It's the first of several steps towards single party rule.As outlined in Project 2025, and as proposed by Trump's allies, this agenda was underway before Trump took office.Through executive actions like Schedule F, through a unitary executive, and through broad immunities granted to the president, among other things, the effort begins to consolidate power and put as many government agencies as possible under the direct control of the executive.From there, the goal will be to erode the independence of these agencies, strip civil servants of their protections, and then cleanse the administrative state of anyone who has not pledged their loyalty to Trump and the MAGA movement In some cases, there will no doubt be efforts to eliminate some of these agencies altogether.The next step will involve exploiting the newly granted unchecked authority of the executive to install loyalists into positions of power once reserved for nonpartisan staff whose job security didn't previously rely on their allegiance to the president and the party.And from there, Republicans will have the best opportunity they've had in decades to follow through on a wide range of unconstitutional threats and crackbrained proposals. This includes threats levied against their political opponents, efforts to target regulatory agencies, which will go a long way in benefitting the rich/corporations at the expense of everyone else, to limit funding and resources for social programs, to roll back civil rights and challenge all kinds of legal precedents, to provide more entryways for conservative organizations to insert themselves into our politics, to develop some religious based code and rule of law for our country...To fund the agencies and undertakings that will target immigrants, marginalized groups, so-called \\"radical leftists,\\" the public health and education systems, expanded voting and abortion access, \\"green\\" and renewable energy projects, aid to foreign countries, funding to \\"blue states\\" and cities, unionization efforts of course, all the journalists and media who are not toeing the line, judges and prosecutors, constitutional amendments, and the list goes on.It's already begun...","title":"The Trump executive orders that threaten democracy"},{"text":"Well Turtle head, hed be in prison if you had a nutsack.","title":"McConnell criticizes Trumps broad pardon of Capitol riot defendants"},{"text":"It amazes me how Reddit practically falls over itself to defend government bloat as long as they think Trump is against it.

I don't think the public regularly interacts with emerging science in the way they were forced to with Covid. All the sweaty engineers figuring out a 3nm chip is the cutting edge, but once it's in an Iphone it just.. works. People would be overwhelmed if they were getting up to the minute updates on the ups and downs of the 3nm architecture as it was being invented. The whole \\"lets pump out information as soon as we have it\\" was, IMO, a bad idea. I think it would have been more effective overall to have better, more deliberate messaging with rationale.

While 80% of Harris supports support stronger border security. However the issue is during the Biden administration, the US had only 4 million permanent resident visas issued and 10 million border crossings. Biden's policies have led to a situation where the *supermajority* of new immigrants to this country crossed the border illegally, which is going to have an extremely toxic effect on the immigration debate as a whole. At the same time, I don't recall a single time that the Biden administration advocated for expanding H-1B or J1 besides fixing Trumps sabotage to the system which I will give him some credit for. The democratic party is associated with being soft on the border the same way they are associated with being soft on crime, because they would rather refuse to enforce basic laws than actually address the problem that causes the lawbreaking in the first place out of what I would assume is pure idiocy.

Bush Just Barely Behaved During Donald Trumps Inauguration"},{"text":"An Executive Order (EO) goes into effect immediately upon being signed by the President, unless it specifies a future effective date, which many of these EOs do, like birthright citizenship has 30 day. It does not require prior judicial approval or a determination of constitutionality to take effect.Executive Orders are presumed constitutional until successfully challenged in court. Courts generally do not evaluate their constitutionality proactively. Someone must file a lawsuit to challenge the EO.If someone believes the EO exceeds the President's authority or violates the Constitution, they can sue, and the court may issue an injunction to block its enforcement. The EO remains in effect unless and until a court invalidates it or halts its implementation. They usually ask for an injunction to stop its implementation, but courts do not have to grant them. I expect a lot of forum shopping and multiple different stays from different courts.While the judiciary checks the EO's constitutionality, Congress can also counteract it by passing legislation that conflicts with or overrides the EO (though this requires a presidential signature or a veto override). Of fucking course, this wont happen.So, an EO is in effect until it is successfully challenged and declared unconstitutional, stayed by a court, or overridden by another legal authority. But, you'll notice where it directly contradicts current federal law, the EO cites the relevant code and instructs the relevant agency head to begin the process of amendment or deletion. For example, Schedule F was proactively blocked through regulations instituted last year (April, I think), so none of that shit can happen until those regulations are changed or amended. Though, you may get enterprising agency heads that try to interpret it in some way where it's Schedule F light, but they'll lose any subsequent litigation until the regulations are deleted or amended, which is a LONG process. Plus, federal employees cannot violate these regulations either, so they can ask someone to do something illegal, but they are under no obligation to do so. It can take years sometimes to amend or change regulations, and if they fuck it up, the new regulations will be thrown out by the courts. Its all part of the Administrative Procedures Act. Federal employees that are being asked to violate law can whistleblow, and if they are fired for it, there are special whistleblower protections for federal employees.","title":"Trumps Awful New Invasion Executive Order is One of His Darkest Yet"},{"text":"It means everyone is a woman because it takes 8 weeks for an embryo to become a male under the law and its assigned based on conception so everyone in the USA is a woman now","title":"Trump Sneaks Dangerous Rights for Fetuses into Executive Order"},{"text":"-In a statement touting the move Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said law enforcement would use common sense in making arrests.- the majority of Americans dont have common sense so theres zero hope of that being applied .","title":"Trump authorizes ICE to target schools and churches"},{"text":"this needs an act of congress. sorry","title":"Repeal ObamaCare NOW!"},{"text":" (d)  Female means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1Kdoja3hlk","title":"Donald Trump Signs Executive Order Rolling Back Many Transgender Rights &amp; Protections"},{"text":"Speaking for myself I have no interest in murdering you.

The National Vaccine Injury Compensation program works as a liability shield for vaccine manufacturers by preventing citizens from suing manufacturers directly, or in class action lawsuits that could bankrupt the industry. *There is now even less incentive than there was in 1955* for vaccines to be properly tested before being provided to the public, because vaccines are shielded from the same level of accountability that would apply to any other product sold in the United States.That program is why you can't sue Pfizer when your spouse has a heart attack at 32 years of age without any prior health history two months after taking the Pfizer covid 19 shot.

Here is a less biased version of what was rescinded.\\\\Trump also rescinded an executive order that prompted the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to create three drug pricing experiments that havent gotten fully off the ground yet. The first model aimed to help state Medicaid programs pay for cell and gene therapies that are highly effective but expensive. The idea was to create multi-state purchasing agreements that would allow states to not pay for drugs if they were ineffective. CMMI has started the process of enrolling states in the pilot program, and the application is supposed to be open through Feb. 28. The second experiment tests having Medicare pay less for drugs that receive accelerated approvals from the Food and Drug Administration. Accelerated approvals make promising drugs available to patients sooner, before its fully proven that the medicines actually work. The reduced payments would, theoretically, incentivize drugmakers to finish studying the medicines through confirmatory trials. The final pilot project is designed to encourage Medicare prescription drug plans to offer generic drugs for common chronic conditions for a flat, $2 copay. The goal was to standardize copays for generic drugs and encourage patients to continue taking medications.https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/20/trump-executive-orders-health-care-drug-pricing-aca-covid-gender-discrimination/","title":"Some question regarding executive order"},{"text":"2029 is gonna be a shit show if we make it that far, yeah.

If you Deport illegal migrants restricting the supply of labor then labor costs will go up and as a result grocery prices will go up. Secondly if you increase tariffs on a good then that tariff will be passed off to the consumer and prices will go up.My point is the difference in price of domestic grown groceries and foreign grown groceries is not that large. And because labor costs are only a percentage of the cost of groceries then the Farm Workers will experience cost push inflation which benefits them.If farm hand wages double and labor costs make up 25% of grocery prices, then grocery prices will only go up by 20% while worker compensation goes up by 100%. There are thresholds where this no longer produces a net positive effect but id argue that since wages have not been keeping up with productivity, and income disparity has been growing, but everybody across the income bracket still has to buy food then we're not going to be close to that Tipping Point in the farming industry for a while. Big picture it results in cost push inflation that benefits the workers at the \\"expense\\" of the broader economy.","title":"Millions Targeted for Immediate Expulsion as Trump Fulfills Vow"},{"text":"Go fuck yourself, traitor.","title":"It doesnt undo the record: Jan. 6 rioter wants record scrubbed and compensation after Trump pardon  but thats not likely to happen, lawyer says"},{"text":"Why would he cut off his biggest potential ally for a money laundering state?","title":"somethingiswrong speculates that Trump only got inaugurated because Putin threatened to nuke Kyiv if Biden refused, that Trump getting inaugurated was part of the plan all along, or sometime in the future the inauguration will be rendered null and void and Biden will become president again"},{"text":"they dont, women's rights are not protected by the constitution. did you know that for decades women were on whats called a \\"urinary leash\\" even your mothers might remember there being no women's restrooms. it was seen as indecent. they said things like \\"imagine the sexual misbehavior that will occur\\". sound familiar?? they dont want trans people in the bathroom because they plan to kick us out as well. if we cant pee in public we'll just have to stay home with the kids.","title":"Trump Sneaks Dangerous Rights for Fetuses into Executive Order"},{"text":"Idk if you try to over throw, violently, a government that was legally elected I think you should be in prison.","title":"Police Officers Who Defended Capitol From Trump's Mob Blast His Mass Pardon Of Rioters: One former officer called Trump's blanket pardon \\"a miserable miscarriage of justice.\\""},{"text":"No it absolutely is not.The far right state in this war is Russia, a country with a far right authoritarian leader, and which meets loads of the criteria for being a fascist state.
