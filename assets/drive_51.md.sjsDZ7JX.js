This assumption seems false. Imagine, for example, that a firing squad is about to execute an innocent person, and you have the option to participate. Each shooter by themselves is sufficient to kill the victim, so any causal contribution you make toward their death will necessarily be overdetermined by other factors. Now, should you participate in the execution? It does not seem like you should, even if your participation or lack of participation will make no difference to the outcome. An obvious explanation of why is that it is wrong to be party to an immoral act, even if your participation is overdetermined. If that is right, then we should reject your initial assumption. So, even if we assume for the sake of argument that your refraining from eating meat makes little to no difference, that would not show that it is permissible to eat meat.","title":"CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are currently pointless."},{"text":"The democrats can be the centre right party and the progressives can splinter and form a new actual left leaning party to be the second party and the non maga republicans can join the dems","title":"CMV: We don't need the old Republican party back"},{"text":"No it's because she said \\"bloodbath\\", which was taken out of context.

And then I read the rest of your comment and it just got worse and worse, to be really honest with you. Trump *literally* literally got the last word on every single question, half of which were because he bullied his way past the moderators and they unmuted his mic. The *only* time Kamala tried to get an extra word in, she was yelled over repeatedlyseveral times more than any attempt against Trumpand she was not allowed any more time. Trump had 5 minutes more of speaking time. Trump was fact checked more than Kamala because he lied 33 times and she lied once. To call it unfair in Kamalas favor is just disappointingly misguided and malinformed. Do you want the media to just make shit up to pretend the lie count was even when it wasnt? Because it wasnt. This isnt some masturbatory centrist jerk off fantasy where everything is exactly even and if it isnt then its clearly biased. Trump is just objectively a liar and Kamala objectively isnt, or at least wasnt during the debate. All of human knowledge exists at your fingertips. You can do your own fact checking. You havent, but you can.I want someone to just be fully honest with you. You need to adjust your perception and be able to realize when people are just absolutely full of shit compulsive liars, because the fact that you couldnt tell the difference and felt that *Trump* was disadvantaged by anyone but himself during that debate is concerning and honestly worrying. If youre going to be this unattuned to politics, current events, and readily apparent misinformation, then Id rather you continue to be disconnected from political engagement than actively harming it.

Conservatives tend to want to keep everything the same without being open to good change.This is a definition of liberal-conservative that hasn't applied to the Democratic-Republican split in decades *at minimum*. By this definition, the Democratic party is frequently conservative and the Republican party is frequently liberal. For example, on abortion, the Democratic party supported the status quo and the Republican party wanted a significant change.Further, it's unclear whether this has *ever* been an accurate representation of major party splits. When has the Democratic position ever been *empirically shown* to be too open to change? That is, what changes have Democrats pushed through that turned out to clearly be in the wrong direction? All of the core Democratic policies since the 1950s have been either borne out or turned out to not go far enough. When has the Republican position ever actually been in favor of *the status quo* and not simply in favor of *Republicans*?It *is* true that a single-party system is not good, as corruption and complacency easily take root; but a healthy multiparty system is more likely from something like \\"Democrats + Socialists + Greens\\" than from another \\"conservative\\" party.ETA:This is simply a differing opinion, not an objectively wrong stance.Economics is not simply a matter of opinion. There is an opinion *component* - \\"which outcomes are desirable?\\" can be described as an opinion. But \\"what are the likely outcomes of policy X?\\" is not a matter of opinion, it's a matter of prediction. There's an objective answer to it, and it can be studied scientifically to try to determine what that answer is.Republican economic policies do include opinions about what outcomes are desirable, but they also consistently include statements about \\"X will lead to Y\\", where that statement is either not backed by current economic science or actively contrary to current economic science.","title":"CMV: We don't need the old Republican party back"},{"text":"Register today &amp; vote all the haters away","title":"Highlights of Kamala Harris' rally in North Carolina!"},{"text":"Without Trump there is no MAGA.Once he's soundly defeated, by that I mean absolutely destroyed at the polls, the orange stain devolves into oblivion.

Any way he got the vaccine rolling and the left was like dont take trumps vaccine and then a couple months later they said  take it or get fired take it or you cant fly.. take it or else basically.  I was listening to a pastor that I follow, Jack hibbs podcast and he had on a federal informant omg! it was so good. Any way she was talking about how much money is made from these wars.. trump is dangerous to the powers that be, the ppl who make money off of the misery of the ppl he is so dangerous to the agenda that they unleashed a virus and a coupe of lock downs  to tank the economy so that they could blame him and get him out.

We should also recognize the problems with two parties. Currently, abortion bans are massively unpopular. Gallup shows about 12% support for abortion bans under all circumstances (85% for legal in all or some circumstances and 3% no opinion)Reasonably, we can guess that not all of that 12% vote Republican consistently, but let's say it's just 5%, or honestly even 1%. Now imagine if every swing state swings by 5% towards Democrats because all those voters are disillusioned by the Republican party compromising on abortion. They decide to stay home, they vote 3rd party, whatever. That's every swing state to Democrats, basically a guaranteed victory. So Republicans see the consensus is compromise, but to retain the chance to win, they have to say nonsense like \\"the states need to decide\\" (because whether we're given souls at conception or birth is a regional issue?). But either way, lots of Republicans are unhappy, lots of pro-life are unhappy.Probably the most important aspect here isn't parties, strictly, it's fixing our first-past-the-post system, typically Ranked Choice Voting. But for any sort of solution, we need choice. Some countries use coalition governments, voters have a choice of 5 different parties, say, but whatever government is formed needs at least 50% of the view. So the Moderate Republican party with 40% of the vote could give concessions to the 12% Ban Abortions party to forge a government with 52% of the vote. Similarly the Moderate Democrat party could form a government with, say, the LGBT Rights party and the Green party, giving a major concession to each (say, stronger language for inclusion of LGBT people into Title IX and significant expansion of wind and solar, and the Mod Dems otherwise do as they wish).In any case, my point is we need *more* parties. There's definitely a point of diminishing returns, under any system, 20 distinct political parties would probably be complete chaos, but 1 is a massive problem.","title":"CMV: We don't need the old Republican party back"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|zOQpjmGixQj52Xikgc)","title":"Highlights of Kamala Harris' rally in North Carolina!"},{"text":"For anyone in Florida interested in helping Powell, join your city/countys Democratic club and/or a Democratic caucus.

They dropped that plan only because of how enormously impractical it was.The GOP is the exact same party it always was: a coalition of big business (such as Mr. Railroads Lincoln and the Pinkerton Railway Police who protected him), and people who don't like cheap imported labour. Lincoln even refused to publicly denounce the anti-catholic immigration Know Nothings because he wanted to keep them in the anti-slavery coalition. People like to trot out the letter where he *privately* denounces them, but the fact that he had to *privately* say \\"I am not a Know Nothing and never have been\\" means he wasn't doing in publicly, and publically there were accusations leveled against him that he did support the Know Nothings, so even the xenophobic party base is there.People just had this idealized vision of Lincoln that they don't realize that Trump is the most similar candidate to Lincoln we have had in a long time. Even one of the first laws the newly Republican congress passed were a new set of tariffs to promote industrialization. Trump *is* the \\"original\\" Republican Party. The only way you could become more original would be to replicate the Fremont-wing of the Republican party rather than the Lincoln-wing, but Fremont lost in 1856 because of vote splitting with the Know Nothing Party nominating former president Millard Fillmore. Yes, the party of the xenophobes were a spoiler party for the abolishment of slavery party because it resulted in xenophobes not voting for the slavery abolition party because the xenophobes prioritized xenophobia over abolishing slavery, but when they no longer had a xenophobic party to vote for, the xenophobes settled for abolishing slavery.","title":"CMV: We don't need the old Republican party back"},{"text":"Of course Harris is going to win.

He learned it from Roy Cohn of course, one of the most vile human beings to ever disgrace humanity with his presence.Trump's narcissism knows no bounds, he's not just always right, but never wrong, infallible, beyond reproach, and incapable of wrongdoing in his mind and the mind of his followers.Which is why they believe so firmly in the idea that, \\"if we lose, you cheated.\\"The so-called party of \\"personal responsibility\\" can't seem to take responsibility for a damn thing, unless of course Trump is taking credit for things he has no business taking credit for.Donald Trump infamously once said to a reporter back in 2016: When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I'm basically the same. The temperament is not that different.Hmm, every once in a while Trump actually does tell the truth.And it's not just a matter of \\"if we lose, you cheated.\\" It's the disturbing reality that Trumpism is its own religious order. Which, consequently, makes Trump God, and Gods can do no wrong.Trump's rhetoric amounts to the words of a prophet, so all those lies he tells are truths to his supporters.Trump has been crying rigged for decades. He's spent his lifetime evading accountability by exploiting his wealth and privilege and gaming the justice system, which is partly why he conflates accountability and \\"persecution.\\" He's so used to getting away with it.His followers also conflate the two, and in the same way they confuse equality with oppression. Partly a result of a combination between an unparalleled sense of entitlement and heavy doses of fearmongering propaganda that appeals to Trump supporters and their many grievances. They are desperate to be constant victims of this or that radical plot/conspiracy manufactured by their leftist oppressors. Trump is the greatest snowflake of them all, life is a zero sum game, and he is always the winner, no matter what.And the audacity of it is baffling. This is a man who has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, a man who cheats at everything. On his wives, on his taxes, even at golf. He is a serial adulterer, fraud, and con artist. He obstructs justice and commits financial fraud whenever the opportunity arises. He lies about his wealth and even threatens to sue anyone who speculates about his actual worth. His financial worth is debatable, but his worth as a human being is a foregone conclusion. So, yes, in the face of defeat, Trump will always claim victory, his followers will always try to rationalize a loss, paint him as the victim, and conjure up whatever conspiracy theories they can to help them affirm their beliefs and their feelings.This is why conspiracy theories are so attractive to conservatives. They've already come to their conclusions, regardless of the facts, the evidence, the reality of the situation. And by embracing these \\"alternative facts\\" they can ignore or dismiss the actual facts of the matter for the sake of protecting Trump and validating their *feelings.*In other words, it allows them to connect point A to point B without regard for anything in the middle.So what happens?Lost elections become rigged.Facts, negative coverage and criticism become \\"fake news.\\"Investigations become \\"witch hunts\\"Indictments and convictions become \\"the weaponization of the justice system.\\"Poor debate performances become engineered by the oppositionActs of right wing political extremism become \\"false flags.\\"Disastrous policies and outcomes become the other team's fault.Blustering and incoherent remarks become the words of a misunderstood, stable genius.Every failure becomes part of some orchestrated scheme by \\"the deep state\\"Every journalist who isn't lobbing Trump softballs becomes a cruel, vindictive, liberal hackEvery Republican defector becomes a \\"RINO\\"Every former staff member or colleague that speaks out against Trump becomes a disgruntled, inept opportunistEvery responsibility is someone else's problemEvery condemned bigot, racist or xenophobe is a victim of \\"the left's\\" unceasing \\"woke\\" agenda.Every loss is a victory...And the list goes on and on.Yes, this is how temperamental first graders think. \\"If we lose, you cheated,\\" is just one aspect of it. The broader pattern of thinking is \\"Trump is never wrong,\\" \\"*WE* are never wrong.\\" In their minds it's as black and white as good vs evil, Trump vs all the cruel, oppressive, corrupt forces trying to take him down. And if you believe otherwise, *you're* the liar, *you're* \\"fake news,\\" *you're* \\"brainwashed.\\" Every loss is a victory, and every victory is in spite of all the evils of the world working against them.","title":"Donald Trump, Who Is Definitely Not Scared to Face Off With Kamala Harris Again, Says He Wont Debate Her a Second Time"},{"text":"Imagine if it turned out that Trump did 9/11 just because he wanted to have the tallest building.

Their margin of error is too wide compared to the thin margins of elections in order to be predictive. But, not trying to play semantics, the things where polls are aggregated (like 538 does) that are trying to be predictive are \\"models\\" and not polls.Leading up to 2016, the entire polling industry knew that Republicans were systematically undercounted. What they do is call up 1,000 people. Then they do math to try to weigh those responses on how those 1,000 people represent what pollsters think the electorate will be in order to generalize it. The secret sauce is how much weight to give. People who continue to reliably vote Republican are increasingly more distrustful and don't respond. So, pollsters are now using a variety of methods to reach out and are adjusting their weight for the responses. [https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/08/28/key-things-to-know-about-us-election-polling-in-2024/](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/08/28/key-things-to-know-about-us-election-polling-in-2024/)Anyway - Trump likely to win or not comes down to voter mobilization. The thing that saved his ass in 2016 and 2020 was that the RNC itself has a great voter mobilization system that supplemented his campaign, which didn't. The Trump take over of the RNC and putting Lara Trump in charge could very well mean this saving grace doesn't exist in the same way it has in the past.When you look at predictive factors from past elections, how strong and from what direction do 3rd party candidates pull is more than enough for these thin margins.

(as seen by Putin now pretending Putin joining is no big deal even though Ukraine is 'different' somehow - as if Saint Petersburg was less important than Rostov-on-Don) It was always about Russia keeping the opportunity to retake those countries, by force if necessary. Simple as that. The country is run by an old apparachik who can't accept that their empire is gone.

Before the election, [they were pointing out that Trump wasn't as far behind as he seemed](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-just-a-normal-polling-error-behind-clinton/). But he notably was a normal polling error behind. Like when a poll is accurate to +/-3 or whatever. He was still within that range. The actual outcome of the election wasn't actually that far off from the polls, accounting for the errors. He was just (luckily or unluckily depending on your feelings about him) off to his advantage in a few key states. That's how he won the electorates. And by that same metric, he wasn't even close to winning in 2020. Biden won 306 to 232. Numbers that are very much not close together. And while their popular votes may seem really close, they weren't. In 2016, Hilary only won the popular vote by about half what Biden won by. Biden beat Trump by popular vote about as handily as Obama won both of his elections. What's more, winning the election but losing the popular vote is an uncommon outcome. It doesn't happen far, far more often than it does. So really, to support your argument, you really only have the 2016 election to base things on. So in 50% of all Trump presidential candidacies, he's exceeded expectations...I don't know that that has any bearing on the 2024 election and polls.","title":"CMV: Trump is more likely to win the election based on his history of outperforming polls."},{"text":"They're bringing out every excuse under the sun ever since the moment the debate ended.The copium level is high and the desperation is heavy.","title":"MAGA Pastor Claims Kamala Harris Deployed 'Witchcraft' in Trump Debate"},{"text":"??","title":"This is the future liberals want."},{"text":"No, that's Shart Week.","title":"Trump insiders reveal he did more prep for poor Harris debate than for Biden showdown: They were stunned"},{"text":"I have never had any problems with Harris.

If you're the head of the executive and the person responsible for enforcing the laws of the country, what do you do?Accusing Trump of sedition for not just sweeping it all under the rug is laughable, and SCOTUS has made it clear in any case that he enjoyed absolute immunity for actions taken as chief executive.The whole piece is just a litany of Circle D talking points written into an 'ooh I'm criticizing the Ds too so you know I'm serious' piece.Trump was in fact a break in the Blob's control of the country, for the first time in living memory, *the people* selected a 'leader' instead of the Blob.  This is because of the success of the Tea Party movement in infiltrating the Blob-controlled R Party, and running a fair primary.

This time, they got the numbers right, but they were so bloody obvious that everyone could see they cheated.So I ask again: what was Trump supposed to do with this obvious hijacking of the democratic process by one camp, coordinated between billionaire backers, the D Establishment, Herself and Obama and the rest of the public-facing Blob, the judiciary, etc etc etc?So yes, the USA is going full fascist, and people can see it.  Not because Trump wasn't brought to justice, but rather because he was, in numerous farcical lawfare prosecutions, twisting the law into a pretzel to 'get' him.

Minor point: It is worth noting that Nate has some serious personal issues and his current business relations definitely call his credibility this year into question.  Further, his paywall model encourages him to make the race look closer than it is.Main point: the key to understanding Trump's outperforming the polls is crowd size.\\"What?\\" you say...Yep.  Trump outperforming the polls tells us one of two things are happening:1. The pollsters are underrepresenting Trump voters by not weighting Trump favorable responses properly.  This implies that there is a significant portion of those polled who think like most Trump voters, and they need to weight their response higher than a Hillary voter because they didn't get enough of the Trump voters to respond to the poll.\\n2. The pollsters are *missing* a demographic.  Some group of people are not represented in the poll because their opinion *does not track* with those they do reach.  Weighting responses can't account for this.  It can give the illusion of representing these people, but when their opinion shifts, the poll is going to miss it.This is where crowd size comes into play: people who show up for rallies represent a very dedicated and enthusiastic part of the voter base.  These people aren't only voters themselves, but they are so enthusiastic about the candidate that they evangelize to their friends and neighbors, they donate, they volunteer.  They actively help the candidate win.My theory is that Trump was right - those screaming masses that supported him *were* the factor that was missed by the pollsters.Now watch a Trump rally - once he starts talking they become quiet, listless.  There is some enthusiasm, but not the adoration that was there in 2016 or even 2020.  And the numbers...the numbers are way down.Now check out a Harris rally.  A vastly diverse, but equally enthusiastic following.  They are filling up indoor arenas.  They are opening up new field offices every day.  People are knocking on doors.  They are making phone calls.Today elections are won by the people who show up that you didn't expect to show up.  Crowds, small money donations, volunteers are leading indicators of these people - not the polls.  I think Harris is the one whose support is being underrepresented in the polls this year.The one weakness in this theory is the Bernie factor.  He had that kind of energy and enthusiasm behind him.  My hope is that without the DNC actively undermining Harris' efforts, that her groundswell support will show up and vote.So that's my crazy theory.  Hopefully, Harris and her team doesn't read it, and they keep doing what they are doing.  Watch the trajectory of the polls, see what demographics are responding to her message.  Keep working.

We could solve it if we were willing to spend a whole lot more money, but we aren't. This notion that we aren't willing to spend MORE money but are something conceptually willing to spend money on others with healthcare means we are somehow more \\"left\\" than americans neglects the fact that Americans who often already pay for their own healthcare are unwilling to pay MORE for the healthcare for others, but they would be willing to pay LESS for healthcare, be it either paying less for their own healthcare or paying less for the healthcare of others, and so Canadians and Americans are the same in that they both don't want to spend more money on healthcare than they already do. The Conservative Party of Canada isn't \\"more left\\" than the Democrats simply because it doesn't try to change the healthcare system (Conceptually you'd think a Conservative Party would always be trying to keep things the same, so Canada doesn't touch its healthcare system because Canadians are more conservative than Americans are and so are less willing to accept change). There are many programs Americans have that Canadians don't have, for instance a particular baffling one given that Americans seem to complain that people want to cut federal funding for school lunches and think that \\"only in America would people be so cruel\\", but Canada for the longest time was the only developed country to NOT have a federally funded national school lunch program. We have only created one in the budget for THIS YEAR, in 2024.[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-national-school-food-program-advocates-1.6980950](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-national-school-food-program-advocates-1.6980950)The inherent conservatism of Canadians meant that we just never got around to creating one, it also means that we probably won't have people trying to get rid of it now that it exists, but it wasn't like people were somehow demanding it, rather it just seems like some \\"experts\\" decided that \\"it was time\\" and I guess now we are going to go a long with it. Those same \\"experts\\" never thought that \\"it was time\\" before this though. As such I would say the main political difference between Canada and America is that in Canada we specifically try to make the least amount of issues to be topics of dicussion as possible. We are pro-abortion only insofar as we want to avoid making abortion rights a heated political debate like it is in the United States, while we have more restrictive gun laws than the US, there is no country other than the US that is neither a former nor a current warzone which has greater levels of gun ownership than Canada, Canadian politicians generally speaking no not to make gun laws a heated issue to avoid \\"americanizing\\" our politics as the voters will punish politicians specifically for doing that (as opposed to taking one side or the other) and making issues out of American things that we CLAIM don't apply in Canada (whether the problem actually is a problem in Canada or not doesn't change the fact that we don't like people discussing what we perceive to be American issues)Americans are a lot freer to take positions on things than people are in Canada, this is what results in the perceived difference in politics, you just think people are more conservative because people are more willing to take dramatically conservative positions, but you don't realize that people in America are more willing to take drastically radical positions like \\"abolition the police\\" which seems to defy the very nature of being a state itself. As such people are more willing to respond to your spending proposals to increase spending on X thing with the claim that \\"we should not be spending ANY money on X\\", whereas in Canada the terms of the debate would be narrower and people would actually just discuss if spending should be increased or if it should be kept the same. Sometimes somebody might suggest we spend LESS money on X, and again the terms of the debate would be if we should indeed spend less money on X or if it should be kept the same, rather than responding to that proposal with something completely different like \\"abolish ICE\\" if someone suggests increased funding to deal with crime on the border with a border wall. Americans are simply more willing to be radical, and that means they are more willing to be radical in a direction we usually associate with \\"conservatism\\" which usually defies being radical by their very nature of being conservative.","title":"CMV: We don't need the old Republican party back"},{"text":"Actually, we just want to never see or hear from frump again.","title":"This is the future liberals want."},{"text":"BREAKING: Trump triggered by factual statement!

Veganism and vegetarianism is on the rise proportional to population if that continues eventually there is a limit to how much overconsumption of meat can keep growing and then that will be the year meat consumption begins shrinking.  Again if everyone thought like you nothing would change.  You can use nonsense metaphors all you want.  Let's put this into context, in 1965, that's 65 not 55, public opinion polls said that 68%, almost 70% of Americans wanted moderation in the enforcement of the civil rights act and the end of segregation.  So even a  year after it was passed the vast majority of Americans wanted them to slow down on civil rights.  Now let's go back to 1955 when  Rosa Parks got arrested.  You think that when 10 years later and the civil rights act being passed still had 70% of the country saying we needed to be moderate about integration that there was wide public appeal when Rosa Parks refused to move?  She and all the others that began the process of the civil rights movement back in the 50's did so when they didn't know what the end result would be, when they knew, certainly in their vicinity in the deep south Alabama etc, that they would be heavily outnumber in public opinion.  If they had your mentality they would have looked at the white majority in their state and the country at large, and they would have changed seats.  Veganism isn't even remotely in the same wheel house as risking life, limb, and freedom to stand up for rights, its a simple personal choice and yet you still want to not even stand on a personal choice, but delegate responsibility to the future because it's just to inconvenient and not popular now.  That's being lazy.  \\nProgress is not driven by people sitting and watching the percentages get to the point they now feel comfortable being moral, progress is driven by moral people deciding to change.  It is lazy and it is cowardice to remove responsibility from yourself simply because you think it's not ready yet, or it won't matter yet.  You are subsidizing your morality on the work of people who have stronger ethical codes than yourself and will put in the work to get that 10% to 11% the next year and 12% the year after.","title":"CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are currently pointless."},{"text":"Remember Thou shalt not Lie is not one of the Ten Commandments and all major clergymen and theologians agree that Not bearing false witness only applies to the the dozens of women and girls accusing Dump of sexual assault.","title":"MAGA Pastor Claims Kamala Harris Deployed 'Witchcraft' in Trump Debate"},{"text":"?Remember when they gave Obama such a hard time because they thought he didnt believe in American exceptionalism?

I knew it was a long shot at the time because of the racial divide in America. But, she has always been so intelligent and capable of quickly learning and taking decisive action: Im really impressed with how much she has taken in and improved, though. Its very obvious that she can listen to advisors and use the ideas that resonate with people to appeal to them. I also really like how shes made her focus on appealing to the emotions of people, while showcasing her empathy. The educated people know that while she may suggest and negotiate overall policies of bills, the lawmaking will ultimately be done by Congress. So there is no need to get bogged down in statistics and policy details, just give overarching themes and general policy ideas for those who are more inclined to tune out the boring stuff of government. Im just happy to see that everyone else is impressed with her and is supporting her so strongly.

It isn't like that stuff is bad, but you have to acknowledge that a country needs to have policies that develop it as a country, the country might need to have supply chains it can control instead of being at the mercy of the global market if something might disrupt global trade like covid, the country might need to establish minimum standards of what it find acceptable, the country might need to put itself first in a chaotic world.The libertarian strain might be able to match some of those things like with non-interventionism in terms of the military, but it is not sufficient since whenever you might want to do something that is conceptually similar to a libertarian position like non-interventionism it might not match the technical definition of being libertarian because you are suddenly required to have some kind of government program that makes non-interventionism easier, for instance by say banning your citizens from travelling on an ocean liner into the middlee of a war zone. In theoretical terms that isn't libertarian, but in practical terms the interventionist forces were able to use stuff like the sinking of the SS Lusitania to not only push the US into the war, but also justify all the infringements of civil liberties that came along with that. Basically the problem is libertarianism makes you unable to think clearly about things because stuff like \\"consequences\\" become alien to your thought process and you just end up being constantly baffled as civil liberties continuously end up getting stripped away because you were unaware of human nature being fickle and likely to pass laws in the heat of the moment under the influence of nefarious forces pushing said laws that become permanent.","title":"CMV: We don't need the old Republican party back"},{"text":"TheTimes is a Fox News owned garbage blog rag that tried to trick you by having a legit sounding name.

They could eat vegetarian if they wanted to.   \\nOne of the big reasons I hear often is that they love the taste and texture of meat. You say that the actions of a single person or even a small percentage of the population don't substantially affect the supply and demand for animal products. But that small percentage has created an industry out nothing over the last two-ish decades. I've been vegetarian for over 30 years now. Back in the day, if you went to a restaurant and wanted something vegetarian, you'd usually get a pasta napolitana, a regular salad without the normal meat, or sometimes nothing at all. Now, I can go down to the local fast-food place and have my choice of three different meat-alternative burgers. My local supermarket has a whole-ass freezer of various soy, Quorn, seitan, etc meat alternatives. Not as much as the meat section, but maybe a third as much?   \\nBack in the early 2000s, you were lucky if you could find tofu or quorn hidden somewhere in the back of the freezer section.That industry is growing massively and at some point in the near future, it'll be both large enough, cheap enough, and tasty enough that veggie alternatives will not just be a viable alternative to meat, but a delicious and interesting choice for meat-eaters. They won't grab a veggieburger because they want to eat less meat, but because they saw it in the store and it looked tasty.But getting there requires R&amp;D and innovation. And to get that done, you need a market to test these products. Even a small group of vegetarians can provide both a testbed and the cash flow required to create and grow such an industry.","title":"CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are currently pointless."},{"text":"Springfield wouldnt even eat that dog","title":"This is the future liberals want."},{"text":"How could 5 to 10% of the earth's population doing something n0t gave an effect?

The end game for this technology is to get to a point where it's cheaper than actual meat, and at this point I think it could make a huge difference - without governmental action (only non interruption). There is a point in between, where the lab meat is more expensive than regular meat, but some people are still willing to buy  it. The more people are vegetarian today, the more these companies know they would have a market to rely on for this intermediate phase.

Estimates are that globally around 20% of the population is vegetarian -- thats 1.6 billion people. Do you really beliebut it will happen anyway and on larger and larger scalesAnd on scales even larger still if the aforementioned percentage also consumed these products. Like no, deciding to buy meat over nonmeat during your individual isolated stop at the grocery store on the way home from work one day doesn't have an impact, but the combined impact of hundreds of millions of people is absolutely substantial.It also \\"rubs off\\" on the rest of the population in a lot of positive ways. For example, most restaurants offer options for people who are vegetarian (and many vegan) because these diets are becoming increasingly popular. Similarly, grocery stores are stocking more various meat alternatives and other traditional products with vegetarian or vegan versions or options. And just naturally, people who do eat meat also sometimes buy these products, unwittingly substituting an animal product for a non-animal product. In isolation these are insignificant, but in totality these things add up quickly! Think about nondairy milks and how they've grown in popularity in the US as an example. They started off as a very niche product with demand mostly from vegetarians/vegans (and the lactose intolerant), and now are popular among even people who eat animal products. And they're ubiquitous -- available in most any grocery story and coffee shop. One person ordering a soy latte instead of a whole milk latte doesn't make a difference in the demand for cow milk, but in totality the difference is significant.","title":"CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are currently pointless."},{"text":"Nope... he'd be hanging from it like the trader to our country he is.

Thought it was an amazIng choice.When the Biden administration stretched into its first few months, I bought into the anti-hype that she was disappointingly absent from the public image of the administration, that she was a disappointing non-factor.But then she did her tour of South America in Summer of 2021, working with them on ways to re-develop their industries, work on crime, etc. and she made her \\"Do Not Come.\\" Speech about migrants during those caravans that launched toward the border, because migrants thought Biden would be the anti-Trump and just let them walk into the states and hand them jobs, money, resources, etc. and she flat out said \\"Do Not Come.

There are many individual actions that really have no impact on the larger issue.Unfortunately you chose the wrong one to focus on. Going vegan or vegetarian is actually the **most** impactful thing you can do as an individual to protect the environment and reduce the impact of climate change. It would take an entire book to describe how and there is one, read [Not the End of the World by Hannah Ritchie](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145624737-not-the-end-of-the-world).Ritchie provides her data and analyses to show it too. The data comes from publicly audited datasets so you don't have to take her word for it. You can replicate her exact same findings but looking at the data yourself (if you're familiar with basic data science principles).So the data actually does support the benefits of individual actions, for going vegan and vegetarian. Not other actions though (like buying an electric car is nearly worse than just using an **old** gas car for as long as possible, then switching to electric later).Also, let's consider some other benefits of people going vegan/vegetarian. As it becomes more popular, it actually helps people who have food allergies related to animal products. Imagine you are allergic to dairy proteins (not lactose intolerant, which is an intolerance to dairy sugars). If you are allergic to proteins like casein, then you need non-dairy (e.g., vegan) options to enjoy much of the food everyone else enjoys! Things like ice cream, cheese, and candy are completely inaccessible to the 2% of the population with this specific allergy. Now expand that to all allergies for other animal products like eggs, tallow, and gelatin. Quickly you get a significantly large portion of the population that can't enjoy animal products and need vegan alternatives.Notice that in my post here, I am completely ignoring the moral, economic, and other advantages of veganism and vegetarianism. Based purely on environmental and improved quality of life arguments, the trend of people going vegan/vegetarian is actually very good for humanity. There are no real/net downsides to this and it has a real impact that is measurable and quantifiable.---Also, you should take another look at the data you are using to come to the conclusion that \\"global demand for animal products is increasing\\" this is only true if you look at nations that are developing into modern economies. In general, the wealthier a nation is, the more animal products its citizens consume. If you look at nations and even specific areas and cities within those nations that have achieved a modern economy long ago, then the demand for animal products is actually **decreasing**.","title":"CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are currently pointless."},{"text":"The post is an excerpt from the article, including the part about the US living standard.","title":"Ukraine war links"},{"text":"I admit I was wrong too.","title":"How many got Kamala wrong when she started and now just can't se anyone else running?"},{"text":"I think he is going to lose the election to where there will be no mistake that he lostHes an old man and has lost his marbles","title":"Kamala Harris won debate but Donald Trump leads on key issues, says Times poll"},{"text":"That seems like a crime","title":"'Hell to pay': Tommy Tuberville threatens Dems with another Jan. 6 riot"},{"text":"Most of the world.","title":"This is the future liberals want."},{"text":"In my opinion the main thing that is missed in this discussion is how the old Republican Party became so weak it allow something like Trump/MAGA to happen.

Hillary beat Trump by 2 percentage points, which isn't far off.You do seem to understand that the electoral college is more important than the national poll, which is a meaningless 'baseball' statistic.But then you point out the \\"Nate Silver 58%\\" thing.  \\nBut as Nate tried to explain to EVERYONE after the 2016 election, 58% chance of winning isn't the same as 58% of the votes. He gave Hillary a 67% chance of winning and she lost and that isn't surprising!Think of it like a coin flip. In a coin flip, each side has a 50% chance of winning. So if either heads or tails comes up, you aren't surprised. But now imagine you have a 3-sided coin(just imagine). It has a 33% chance of coming up on heads. But if you flip the 3-sided coin and it comes up heads, you aren't really surprised. It was a 33% chance. I could explain more about how Silver's modeling works, but basically he is saying that in 500 simulations he ran, trump won 290 of them and Harris won 210. While that is certainly good news for Trump, it doesn't mean much. It is essentially a 50/50 race with Trump having a slight lead. But this is still a month before the election! Nate would even tell you that this is so close that the arbitrary decisions he has made in his model have more impact than anything else.**Nate Silver's previous predictions**You also need to realize that Nate Silver rose to fame because he basically pointed out in 2012 that Obama was a lock. His point was incredibly valid. Despite national polls being close, Obama had an absolute lock on the electoral college. He wasn't up by a little, he was up by A LOT.  Despite winning by less than 4% of the popular vote(51%), Obama won 62% of the electoral college. Nate was trying to make an argument that the traditional media was ignoring the statistical reality of the electoral college to play up the drama of the election to sell more papers. He was proven absolutely right and he went from a hated pariah of election coverage to the golden child. But if you followed Nate and 538 back in 2016, he tried to make it abundantly clear that he wasn't Nostradamus.  His method was really only applicable to situations where the popular vote was close but the electoral college was not close. In close elections, he has basically said that his presidential model is useless and only about as valid as the national poll changes.","title":"CMV: Trump is more likely to win the election based on his history of outperforming polls."},{"text":"Im not sure you understand any of those ideologies.","title":"Young women are more liberal than theyve been in decades, a Gallup analysis finds"},{"text":"What was the official reason for this collapsing BEFORE the towers or was it never spoke about","title":"Happy 9/11"},{"text":"Fortunately, it's been archived: https://archive.md/3AZCwIt's interesting he was saying this in July 2022.","title":"Ukraine war links"},{"text":"The actions of a single person, or even 5-10% of the population, do not substantially affect the supply and demand fornanimal productswhat a horrible line of reasoning.

The main cause (IMHO) was voting racists defecting from the Democrats after Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act.

And isn't it hilarious that the network *he created to keep a corrupt and criminal political party in power* isn't radical enough for the very party it was supposed to support?Despite the Reagan administration's woes (as though Oliver North would have lifted a finger without orders from the top!), the rot didn't really set in until the mid-90s. That's when Republicans REALLY started to gerrymander the states under their control at the time to make sure they stayed under their control, such as Michigan and North Carolina - both states are about 50% each party, but both send 60-70% Republicans to their respective state legislatures and the House of Representatives.Anti-abortion is just an easy way to activate supposed Christians, as though the Bible itself doesn't describe using abortion as a test for infidelity - or talk about ripping babies out of mothers by good faithful soldiers.EDIT: And no, I'm not pro-Commie either.

There is a very small progressive wing among the large tent of the Democratic Party.With respect to education, Republicans are primarily responsible for the charter system, which has helped millions of children out of generational poverty, and if it weren't implemented, would probably have caused the illiteracy rate among children in the United States to blow past the already staggering levels it is at right now.

In the 'dark ages', i.e. early medieval period, large parts of Europe still held onto some pagan beliefs, and the church tried to convert them. The majority of actual witch trials took place after the end of the medieval era, during the beginning of the 'enlightenment' and the colonial era, after a new form of mass media (printing press) had been developed, when some demagogues looked for an excuse to get famous and toured the country accusing all sorts of people (mostly jews, who had always been a favorite target, and random women) of heresy, such as Heinrich Kramer, author of the Hammer of Witches. First he was ridiculed by the clergy (it was a commonly held opinion that to believe in witchcraft is to deny the power of God, and in itself sinful), but he gained popularity among the guillible people and let them into frenzy after frenzy, leading to a number of witch trials and pogroms. He, of course, got wealthier and more influential as it went on.Sound familiar? It's the same old story every time. We do appear to be doomed to repeat history time and again, and I really don't know what to do anymore at this point. I thought we had learned from the medieval prosecution of jews, the colonial era prosecution of 'witches' and slaves, the prosecution of jews, socialists, homosexuals and all sorts of other people by the Nazis, the prosecution of racial and political minorities during the red scare, the discrimination and categorical rejection of muslims after 9/11 (including the pointless invasions of middle eastern countries), the currently emerging conservative 'trans scare', or any of the other thousands of examples of demagoges gaining power by feeding into the same old conspiracy 'theories', leading to genocide after genocide.

The concept of the honorable opposition is an important balancing point. While I disagree with many of the CONCLUSIONS conservatives end up making, the route many on the left take when given unchecked power without balancing voices goes way too far. Part of the extreme attenuation in political beliefs in this country stem from the echo chambering where you can get people who keep differentiating themselves by spouting more and more extreme beliefs that take people to the fringes more and more, pulling apart at the center positions. It is important in our democracy to have a push and pull effect to ensure more voices are heard and no one side gets full reign without consequence, because without those shackles, it's far too easy to get narrow minded about who the \\"average American\\" is.Hilary is a pretty center establishment democrat, and her basket of deplorables speech, has exemplified how unchecked, it's easy to lose touch with voices we don't FORCE our selves to hear. The modern Kamala movement with things like her VP pick in a mid westerner who appeals to middle America, is an embodiment of the democratic party forcing itself to re evaluate where the country is and how to win back voters they alienated with the previous decade of the appearance of costal elitism. And that's a GOOD thing, the Democrats are now forced to appeal to MORE voters, which is what you want a political party to ultimately do.Conservatives need to do the same, if that means we get more Neocons back sure. If that means a new conservative movement needs to rise up, that actually holds American values, I'm fine with that. There needs to be a party that can push back against some of the anti American values growing in the furthest parts of the left, JUST AS MUCH as the democrats have been the ones to hold the far right to task over the growing anti American sentiments there.","title":"CMV: We don't need the old Republican party back"},{"text":"It's because they're all GLOBALISTS.

Gershkovich is ethnically Russian and was born in New York, while Abu Akleh was ethnically Palestinian and was born in Jerusalem. There's no way to do revisionist history and guess what would happen if they were completely different people, but both were reporting embarrassing things about the governments that persecuted them.Were they taking actions that an American not of the host populations would reasonably have known not to take?Both were registered journalists. Gershkovich was registered with Russia's foreign ministry, and Abu Akleh had even been allowed to report from an Israeli prison. Gershkovich was baselessly accused of committing espionage, and Abu Akleh's death was said by Israeli officials to be an accident. However, multiple media organizations have surmised that she was killed by IDF forces and found no evidence of militants in her area or direction. She was wearing a blue vest that identified her as press. In my opinion, both were courageous journalists who had personal connections to the issues they were reporting on (Gershkovich's parents fled the Soviet Union), which may have made them more willing to take reporting roles at high risk of government persecution and retribution. However, this is not a \\"reasonableness\\" test, the same way that an American reporter who traveled to the frontlines of Ukraine would not be blamed for their own death or injury if Russian forces targeted them. There is no evidence that either journalist took unreasonable actions to put themselves in more danger than any journalist who reports things influential people want to keep secret.In the case of Eygi, she was not a journalist. Preliminary investigations seem to show that she was probably in a similar position to Abu Akleh: out of the way of any violence, not identified as press, *but* in her case, participating in a demonstration. All three of them seem to have been subjects of unreasonable aggression by the respective governments and participating in liberal direct action that the US usually champions, but in dangerous areas for people who participate in such action.I believe the possession my most valuable possession is my American passport. In almost any IR situation, the American government takes that extremely seriously and is willing to fight for me because of it (see Brittney Griner). I pointed out Evan Gershkovich because, were he to die in Russia, our pursual of his release seems to indicate that the government would be much harsher and more sympathetic to his family than they have been to at least Eygi. While I think that this issue alone would be insufficient to warrant sanctions, the public victim-blaming and lukewarm reaction from the government would be seen as they are if the offending government had been any other than Israel: wholly insufficient and emblematic of extreme weakness in our position as a supposed ally. Hamas is sanctioned as a terrorist organization by the State Department.

And like vaccines or not, the vaccines did help stabiles the situation worldwide.Below also from ChatGPT to remain neutral and focus on facts. # 1. Pre-COVID Economic Growth* **Tax Cuts and Job Creation**: Trump's **Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)** was a significant driver of corporate investment and job creation. Many businesses used the extra capital to invest in equipment, expand operations, and hire workers. By reducing the corporate tax rate, the administration argued this would incentivize domestic production and reduce offshoring, creating more American jobs. The unemployment rate dropped to historic lows, particularly benefiting minorities and low-income workers.\\n* **Wage Growth**: While wage stagnation had been a long-standing issue in the U.S., wage growth, particularly at the lower end of the income scale, accelerated during Trumps presidency. This was partly due to tighter labor markets and minimum wage increases at the state level.# 2. Trade Policies* **Tariffs and Trade Wars**: Trump's administration pursued aggressive trade policies, notably tariffs on Chinese imports and renegotiations of trade deals like **USMCA** (replacing NAFTA). These moves were aimed at protecting U.S. industries and jobs from unfair foreign competition. While tariffs had mixed impacts on various sectors (e.g., higher costs for some manufacturers), supporters argued they led to more leverage in negotiations and began to address longstanding trade imbalances.# 3. COVID-19 Response* **Early Action**: While the overall COVID response remains debated, it's important to note that Trump did take early steps, such as restricting travel from China in January 2020, which the administration argued helped delay the spread of the virus.\\n* **Operation Warp Speed**: This public-private partnership was crucial in developing vaccines in record time. By investing billions of dollars in vaccine research, development, and production, the Trump administration set the stage for widespread vaccine distribution, even if the rollout encountered logistical challenges initially.# 4. The Economy Biden Inherited* **Rebounding Economy**: While the pandemic hit the U.S. economy hard, its also important to note that by the end of Trumps term, the U.S. was on a recovery path. For example, GDP growth in Q3 2020 showed a dramatic rebound (33.4% annualized), and unemployment was falling, though still higher than pre-pandemic levels. The CARES Act and monetary support from the Federal Reserve played key roles in stabilizing the economy during the worst of the crisis.\\n* **Long-Term Economic Impacts of COVID Relief**: While the national debt and budget deficits increased significantly under Trump, much of the spending was seen as necessary to avert deeper economic damage during the pandemic. Similar to how other countries responded, the scale of government intervention was unprecedented, and many economists viewed this as essential to prevent a full-blown depression.# Balancing Positives and Criticism:The reality is that every administration faces both successes and challenges, and any assessment must consider the context. The Trump administration's economic record before the pandemic was strong in many ways, with record-low unemployment and strong stock market performance. However, the pandemic fundamentally altered the trajectory of the economy. Both Trumps administration and the Biden administration faced challenges related to COVID-19, and some policy decisions had complex short- and long-term impacts, such as the rising deficit.","title":"What do you say WHEN"},{"text":"maybe you should understand how our government works.when you start attacking the person instead of the point then you fail in logic and not based in reality.

The WIFIA program offers long-term loans to help communities implement critical water infrastructure projects, which protect public health, deliver environmental benefits, create over 60,000 good-paying jobs, protect waterways including drinking water sources, and support local economies, at a lower cost.  \\n...  \\nThe WIFIA program provides its borrowers with creative, affordable financing options. It can fund the planning, design, and construction of a wide range of water infrastructure projects and offers the ability to combine multiple projects into a single loan. By streamlining the funding process, communities can accelerate their infrastructure projects. The WIFIA program offers interest rate resets, debt structuring, and fast disbursements, benefits not traditionally offered with other financing sources. For example, borrowers may defer repayment for up to five years following construction completion, and then customize their repayment schedule through the 35-year loan term. This flexibility provides borrowers with immediate funding to implement projects while helping to keep rates more affordable.This is the eighth round of funding available, and it includes $6.5 billion available through WIFIA and $1 billion available through the State Water Infrastructure Financing Authority, known as SWIFIA. EPA is accepting letters of interest for WIFIA and SWIFIA loans. To date, EPAs WIFIA program has closed loans totaling more than $20 billion to help finance $44 billion in projects across the country. More than 100 borrowers nationwide are utilizing WIFIA loan to finance projects that benefit over 64 million Americans. Completed WIFIA-financed projects show positive health and environmental outcomes, as well as the advantages of financing with WIFIA loans. For example:* Orange County Water District (California) customers have a more drought-proof drinking water supply and are less reliant on imported water due to the completion of the Groundwater Replenishment System Expansion project. When interest rates lowered in 2020, the district was able to lower its interest rate, saving it an additional $75 million in financing costs.\\n* City of Wichita (Kansas) residents benefit from more reliable drinking water because of its new Northwest Water Treatment Facility. Due to WIFIA financing, the project was initiated seven years sooner than originally planned and now delivers clean drinking water to the community.\\n* City of Tacoma Sewer Utility (Washington) customers have a more reliable, resilient wastewater treatment system because of the completion of the Electrical Distribution System Replacement Project, which modernized the treatment plants electrical system. By deferring WIFIA loan repayment for four years after construction completion, the city can pay off existing state-revolving fund (SRF) loans prior to repaying their WIFIA loan. The funding announcement demonstrates EPAs continued commitment to water infrastructure improvements that ensure all communities have access to clean and safe drinking water. For this round of funding, EPA has identified the following priority areas:* Increasing investment in disadvantaged communities and improving health and livability.\\n* Making rapid progress on lead service line replacement.\\n* Addressing PFAS C known as forever chemicals C and emerging contaminants.\\n* Strengthening climate resilience in the water sector.\\n* Supporting water innovation and resilience....List of recipients for this latest round of funding can be found in a link towards the bottom of the press release. Statement from EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan:Good infrastructure is the foundation for delivering clean, safe water to people across the country, said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan. The Biden-Harris administration has prioritized water infrastructure investment with this $7.5 billion infrastructure funding through WIFIA, on top of the unprecedented $50 billion in funding the Biden-Harris Administration secured under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. With these resources, communities will keep building on progress to replace lead pipes, cut PFAS pollution, and protect people from climate change.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Announces $7.5 billion in Available Financing for Water Infrastructure Projects"},{"text":"maybe you should understand how our government works.

While I think they overall have the better stances right now, there are things that I absolutely don't want to support. And it will only get worse if there isn't another competent party keeping them in check. A conservative party makes sense. The best way to move forward is to keep what we've done well in the past while making our weaker aspects better. Liberals tend to be too open to changing everything, even the things that we already do well. Conservatives tend to want to keep everything the same without being open to good change. So they're a good counterbalance to eachother. If one party has control and either erodes good systems or is unwilling to change, it is natural that the other party will win the next election.Now if you mean specifically the republican party, I could agree with that. I think a libertarian party would make more sense as the conservative party to keep the democrats in check. The Republicans have not been good about holding some key values, like having a small government.With regards to economic policies - All their solutions revolve around tax cuts, deregulation and privatizing industries that should be a basic public services not built on a profit model ie Public Education, Healthcare and cutting social safety nets.This is simply a differing opinion, not an objectively wrong stance.","title":"CMV: We don't need the old Republican party back"},{"text":"The daily show interviewed a guy who thought Obama was president.

That's what real patriotism looks like; taking the lead and helping to solve a problem.We did the same thing with the Covid vaccine and project Warp Speed. It was a big win with how fast the vaccine was produced, how America took the lead in organizing international groups for an international response to a global issue, and probably saved millions of lives. America should have taken a ton of pride in that effort.... but of course the entire thing is marred by the US's initial response to the pandemic, the right (and Trump) pushing hoax \\"cures,\\" and the left, for some reason, not being proud enough to acknowledge this amazing development as both a response to Covid and a new way to develop vaccines writ large.That is huge.

It was over as soon as it started.The nightmare scenario for the Democrats was putting up an establishment candidate like Harris, and then the progressive wing latching on to someone else leading to a fracture in the party that would have been resolved behind closed doors. Would have been okay during a primary where there was voting on who to pick, but it would have been a disaster to happen in Chicago.Makes me think that AOC knew what she was doing when she came out so strong for keeping Biden after the debate.

Society needs both liberals and conservatives to fight it out publicly. They both have an important role.

Im not worried about the Democrats at the moment, Im worried about the Republicans. But neither of them deserve to reign eternal. We need them to eventually be healthy and functioning. And I do actually view Trump as an aberration. I think to a degree the Republicans brought MAGA and its cultism on themselves, but by bringing it on themselves they brought it on all of us too. \\nOne thing to consider is that it use to be quite common for political parties in the US to fall away and disappear. It would happen every several election cycles, or so. Then came the Civil War. And the Democrats and the Republicans became entrenched. It actually would be okay, in my opinion, for a party to die off and a new one to take its place. It would seem strange to us as it happens, but it is an okay and healthy thing that is part of the democratic process. \\nOr they can just purge themselves of MAGA, somehow, that would be fine too. But we do actually need at least two parties. Frankly if we can implement something like ranked choice voting we could even have more than two parties. That would be great.

This desire will be translated into elected lawmakers and policy most likely in the form of some kind of conservative party otherwise we are no longer a democracy and that's when people start dying by the hundreds of thousands.If you want a democracy conservatives will have a voice in that system one way or anohter. If you don't want them to have a voice or a party then you should just be honest with yourself and everyone else about what kind of structural illiberalism you are advocating for.","title":"CMV: We don't need the old Republican party back"},{"text":"What was his mic drop?","title":"GOP constantly posting Democrats have been in charge 12 of last 16 years...."},{"text":"I am flabbergast.

They'd just pass the new tariff being levied by their government onto the price to US companies. Which just gets us to increased consumer prices, but with more steps.Further, in the pretend world we're in here, maybe the argument is China, after collecting the tariffs, writes the US a check for the year and Trump reduces everyone's taxes with the offset....want to buy a bridge?And while this will be different in various industries, a quick example of an item bought from china going through a distributor/wholesaler to a retailer can look like this;Landed Price $5       Wholesale $10    Retail $19.99Just a $1 increase on landed price (20% Tariff) maintaining same margins %ages;Landed Price $6        Wholesale $12    Retail $23.99It all seems a bit 'unreal' when you talk tariff %ages but when you can say a 20% tariff will cost $24 instead on $20 it gets a bit more real.There is just no way - unless companies eat the increase - that tariffs do not increase consumer prices.BTW - sorry about the long reply...bit of a hot button topic here!!","title":"21 False Claims &amp; Hoaxes by Kamala Harris that ABC's Debate Moderators Did Not Fact Check"},{"text":"What about the other moderator?","title":"Kamala Harris and Linsey Davis (the unbiased moderator) were sorority sisters!"},{"text":"So hes not running then?
