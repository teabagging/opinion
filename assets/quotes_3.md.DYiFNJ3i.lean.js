Donald Trump C along with his so-called first buddy, Elon Musk C is the final and inevitable conclusion of decades of inaction on the part of world leaders to put a check on extreme inequality.Its hard to be optimistic about what lies ahead over the next four years C and maybe more C but if officials want to do something to ensure the stability of our democracies, they need only find the political resolve to once and for all tax wealthy people like me.The campaign group has taken a letter to Davos, in Switzerland, to hand to attendees of the World Economic Forums annual jamboree, at which the super-rich mingle with business and political leaders.

The Constitution gives the President whoever he/she may be command of our military and officers take an oath to follow lawful orders issued by command authority.  The fact that Miley contacted a potential US enemy (China) and told them if Trump ordered an attack he would give them warning completely destroys the idea of civilian control of the military and IMO is treason!  If Trump had issued such an order Miley could refuse to carry it out and claim it was unlawful.  Let the courts decide if it was or not.   Of course the reason Trump ordered such an attack is unknown since it was never given. The military is the only organization that can successfully carry out a coup and why they must always remain under civilian control.

You have to spend a whole paragraph of every reply explaining what you mean. For example, the article you're referencing makes a critical mistake of categorizing socialism and capitalism as political ideologies, when in reality they are economic ideologies. And most economic systems will be heavily reliant on capitalism while relying on some level of socialism to compensate for capitalisms weak points. The main argument in the real world ends up being the line for said compensation, but online it's fairly understandeable that most people tend to have an all or nothing approach to both. Because of this, political factions tend to be built around the economic pbilosophies. This is confusing and annoying, only lending to the idea that this argument is very difficult to have, especially online. For now, I will generally refer to socialists as far left political parties advocating more or less for all or nothing socialist economic policies.That being said, I think the issues you've brought up have more to do with liberalism and populism. While liberalism is typically highly capitalist, it's purpose is more for encouraging liberty - both public and individual. This means capitalistic freedoms, but also the right of the People to govern over these capitalistic forces. More of the real life blend that I mentioned earlier. Populist forces tend to be, well, popular! Even if they are ingerently damaging to the liverties if a People to govern themselves in exchange, or the personal (and perhaps capitalistic) freedoms of individuals in an out group (see Jews in Nazi Germany).First, to steelman the liberal argument: The Nazis worked with and received a large degree of support from socialists. Also fascists. Both movements are fairly polulist in nature, and both thought they could gain from the other. You can see that in the modern day with people like Cenk of The Young Turks speaking positively of the right at Turning Point USA events and the like. The liberal sees that this support from the far left will strengthen the fascists until they are strong enough to take over and end with them being canabalized by the fascists who will tolerate nothing but conformity to fascism. Thus the liberal fights both the socialist and the fascist.Who's *actually* fascist or *actually* socialist in the modern day? Again, nobody knows because these words both mean fucking anything depending on who you're talking to. In my opinion, after you get out of highschool this argument slowly becomes more and more meaningless. Just talk about the actual things people are doing. Generally I see populist rhetoric in general to be the main enemy to classical liberalism. Or, to put it more simply, people are willing to throw away the systems that protected them when they were out of power if it means they can get their way while in power. Without these systems, there is very little to guarantee citizens from having their rights stripped away by a tyrannical government. Said tyrants often being populist demagogues who conned their way into power with promises of free stuff they do not have the ability to give without a high cost in aforementioned right-stripping, and/or economic downturns, and/or extreme militaristic mobilization. Often this cost is completely unseen until it is too late, often by deliberate ignorance because of the short term gain, whatever it may be.That's generally what my conservative upbringing has taught me to fear, usually from socialists and communists. I think this should apply to more right leaning demagogues as well, but deliberate ignorance is very hard to overcome for both sides.I think discussing these ideas this way is a fun place to start, but generally doesn't translate to reality *that* well since these words mean so much and so little at the same time. I find it easier to talk about specific policies like the border or guns or foreign policy or what have you. If you want to justify them you should talk about why they're good or bad for the Amerjcan people, not whether or not they're socialist or Nazi.","title":"Whos the real Nazis"},{"text":"Why are you running as a Democrat?

The inquiry started in 2013 after the Finance Ministry's financial crimes unit noticed several transfers of more than 1 million reais ($308,500) from accounts in Panama to his accounts in Brazil.In a November interview with Reuters, Nogueira denied any wrongdoing in Brazil.He said that he only learned after the Trump Ocean Club project was almost complete that some of his partners and investors in the project were criminals, including some with what he described as connections to the \\"Russian mafia.\\"Nogueira, whose whereabouts are unknown, said he had not knowingly laundered any illicit money through the Trump project, although he said he had laundered cash later in other schemes for corrupt Panamanian officials.Garten said in November: \\"No one at the Trump Organization, including the Trump family, has any recollection of ever meeting or speaking with this individual.\\"Torres and Engel wrote in their letter that obtaining answers from the Trump Organization on the Panama project was \\"essential as we carry out oversight of U.S. policy towards Latin America and the Caribbean.\\"They said they wanted to ensure that Trump was \\"fully committed to the goal of dismantling the transnational criminal organizations that are responsible for smuggling drugs into the United States.\\"\\"If the President, in a previous role, failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the laundering of drug money, it would be of grave concern to us,\\" the letter read.","title":"Lawmakers question Trump ties to Panama project linked to laundering, trafficking | U.S. Congresswoman Norma Torres of California's 35th District"},{"text":"Reforming the DNC is a fools errand.

However, a pardon cannot apply to future conduct, only past offenses.Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution reads:*The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices,*?and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.**[https://www.kgw.com/article/news/verify/government-verify/can-president-pardon-someone-crime-they-have-not-been-charged-with-fact-check/536-8cf9810d-1b64-40fe-add9-32a2d2a6786e](https://www.kgw.com/article/news/verify/government-verify/can-president-pardon-someone-crime-they-have-not-been-charged-with-fact-check/536-8cf9810d-1b64-40fe-add9-32a2d2a6786e)","title":"Trumps Department of Justice Needs To Go After the Biden Family Immediately.

The order calls for a review of obstacles to domestic energy infrastructure resulting from legal environmental protections like the Endangered Species Act.# Executive order repealing Biden-era environmental protections and promoting resource extraction in AlaskaThe executive order [Unleashing Alaskas Extraordinary Resource Potential](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-alaskas-extraordinary-resource-potential/) reverses a number of restrictions on drilling and extraction in Alaska set by the Biden Administrationwhich included protecting areas within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from oil and gas leasingto promote oil, gas, and other resource extraction from the state of Alaska.","title":"Trumps Department of Justice Needs To Go After the Biden Family Immediately.

Hospitals and clinics would compete to offer the best care and preventative measures. This competition would incentivize them to develop effective responses to outbreaks, including research and development of vaccines.2. **Voluntary Cooperation**: Individuals and businesses would be free to choose how to respond to a pandemic. Some may decide to implement their own health measures, like personal protective equipment or social distancing, while others may opt for different responses. The key is that these decisions would be made voluntarily, based on personal risk assessments and preferences.3. **Market-Driven Research**: Without government funding, vaccine and treatment development would be driven by market demand. Investors and pharmaceutical companies would be motivated to create solutions that could be sold to consumers, leading to faster innovation and potentially more effective products.4. **Information Sharing**: In a decentralized society, information about outbreaks would be shared through private channels, including independent news organizations and health experts. This would allow individuals to make informed decisions about their health and safety.5. **Contractual Agreements**: Individuals and businesses could create contracts that specify health measures. For example, a venue might require proof of vaccination or other health standards for entry. This creates a system of accountability and choice without government imposition.6. **Community-Based Solutions**: Communities could organize their own responses, pooling resources for public health education and local health initiatives. This grassroots approach could be more effective and tailored to local needs than broad government policies.","title":"How do Liberatarians deal with pandemics?"},{"text":"Just goes to show how tolerant and peaceful they are.

In response, Flake basically said that hed have to seriously consider his vote (he ultimately ended up voting to confirm anyway, because of course he did). I was absolutely glued to the account of this one reporter on Twitter who was frequently giving updates on the situation, and at one point even said that this one woman was possibly going to keep Kavanaugh from being confirmed, even though it was actually pretty obvious in hindsight that Flake was just trying to score bipartisan brownie points and likely never intended to change his vote (see also: Collins, Susan).

Thats 270C360 hours total, calculated using a simple framework like this:\\t?\\tLecture time: 3 hours per week for 15 weeks per semester = 45 hours/semester. Multiply by 2 semesters = 90 hours.\\t?\\tHomework and study time: 2C3 hours for every lecture hour = 90C135 hours/semester.

Now imagine what someone with a PhD in climate science brings to the table: 8,500C17,500 hours of focused research, coursework, and fieldwork, often over 5C7 years. These are people who dedicate their lives to understanding the intricacies of this field.We trust specialists in other areas of life without hesitationsurgeons, engineers, pilots. Why should it be any different for climate science, a field that affects not just one person but entire generations?As a Russian immigrant, Ive seen firsthand what happens in societies where intellectualism is dismissed, where loud voices drown out informed perspectives. It leads to dangerous decision-making and societal decline. I dont want that for the U.S., and I know many of you dont either.So what can we do? Lets work together to elevate the conversation.

The decisions we make today will shape the world for our children and grandchildren. I know how important this is for everyone, I myself have 3 kids. Im saying this not out of frustration, but because I believe in you. We are all capable of engaging in this discussion thoughtfully, even if we arent the experts ourselves.

Democracy is a method of election, of getting people to give their opinion, but *manipulating* that opinion?  Evil, but not technically undemocratic.Which feels wrong!  It feels like those don't count as being fair strategies!  But right now they are.  And there's this messed up mindset of believing that not only will the other guy do it, but there's no hope of victory if they don't use these sorts of shady tactics to get people on their side.Which is the flaw of the current form of democracy.I don't think people are virtue signalling or lying.  Mostly.  I think that there's a mix of the fact that this is the way our democracy just *works*, and a disbelief that it can be done any way + a dread that any attempt to improve democratic systems will just make things worse.My home state recently voted down an amendment which would have strengthened our democratic processes by implementing ranked choice voting.

But in a corrupted city this institution grew to be most mischievous. For it was no longer those of greatest worth, but those who had most influence, who sought the magistracies; while all who were without influence, however deserving, refrained through fear. This untoward result was not reached all at once, but like other similar results, by gradual steps. For after subduing Africa and Asia, and reducing nearly the whole of Greece to submission, the Romans became perfectly assured of their freedom, and seemed to themselves no longer to have any enemy whom they had cause to fear. But this security and the weakness of their adversaries led them in conferring the consulship, no longer to look to merit, but only to favour, selecting for the office those who knew best how to pay court to them, not those who knew best how to vanquish their enemies. And afterwards, instead of selecting those who were best liked, they came to select those who had most influence; and in this way, from the imperfection of their institutions, good men came to be wholly excluded.\\"- Machiavelli, Niccol.

And sure enough, it came...The so called \\"federal hiring plan,\\" which is just one step towards restructuring the government to fulfill the agendas and interests of one party. It's the first of several steps towards single party rule.As outlined in Project 2025, and as proposed by Trump's allies, this agenda was underway before Trump took office.Through executive actions like Schedule F, through a unitary executive, and through broad immunities granted to the president, among other things, the effort begins to consolidate power and put as many government agencies as possible under the direct control of the executive.From there, the goal will be to erode the independence of these agencies, strip civil servants of their protections, and then cleanse the administrative state of anyone who has not pledged their loyalty to Trump and the MAGA movement In some cases, there will no doubt be efforts to eliminate some of these agencies altogether.The next step will involve exploiting the newly granted unchecked authority of the executive to install loyalists into positions of power once reserved for nonpartisan staff whose job security didn't previously rely on their allegiance to the president and the party.And from there, Republicans will have the best opportunity they've had in decades to follow through on a wide range of unconstitutional threats and crackbrained proposals. This includes threats levied against their political opponents, efforts to target regulatory agencies, which will go a long way in benefitting the rich/corporations at the expense of everyone else, to limit funding and resources for social programs, to roll back civil rights and challenge all kinds of legal precedents, to provide more entryways for conservative organizations to insert themselves into our politics, to develop some religious based code and rule of law for our country...To fund the agencies and undertakings that will target immigrants, marginalized groups, so-called \\"radical leftists,\\" the public health and education systems, expanded voting and abortion access, \\"green\\" and renewable energy projects, aid to foreign countries, funding to \\"blue states\\" and cities, unionization efforts of course, all the journalists and media who are not toeing the line, judges and prosecutors, constitutional amendments, and the list goes on.It's already begun...","title":"The Trump executive orders that threaten democracy"},{"text":"Still would be nice to give him few more impeachments after taking House back in midterms.??","title":"Elon Musk's 'Government Efficiency' Department Revealed to Be a Renamed Obama Agency Tasked with Updating Software"},{"text":"Well, when constituents in red and purple states are in favor of the bill (like Georgia), Id rather that the Senators in these states (like Ossoff and Warnock) vote in favor so that they maintain political good will and have a better chance of being elected.Ultimately all politicians are beholden to their constituents, we shouldnt shoot ourselves in the foot by purity testing Senators when theyre just trying to represent the voices of their constituents.","title":"Senate Dems criticize party's handling of Laken Riley Act"},{"text":"Unironically, I believe the exact opposite.

The issue as I see it (and I'm expanding this to covid messaging at large rather than JUST what came out of the WHO), is that they did a poor job of setting expectations and over estimated the general public's familiarity/comfort with science and the scientific process. I don't think the public regularly interacts with emerging science in the way they were forced to with Covid. All the sweaty engineers figuring out a 3nm chip is the cutting edge, but once it's in an Iphone it just.. works. People would be overwhelmed if they were getting up to the minute updates on the ups and downs of the 3nm architecture as it was being invented. The whole \\"lets pump out information as soon as we have it\\" was, IMO, a bad idea. I think it would have been more effective overall to have better, more deliberate messaging with rationale.

Here is a less biased version of what was rescinded.\\\\Trump also rescinded an executive order that prompted the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to create three drug pricing experiments that havent gotten fully off the ground yet. The first model aimed to help state Medicaid programs pay for cell and gene therapies that are highly effective but expensive. The idea was to create multi-state purchasing agreements that would allow states to not pay for drugs if they were ineffective. CMMI has started the process of enrolling states in the pilot program, and the application is supposed to be open through Feb. 28. The second experiment tests having Medicare pay less for drugs that receive accelerated approvals from the Food and Drug Administration. Accelerated approvals make promising drugs available to patients sooner, before its fully proven that the medicines actually work. The reduced payments would, theoretically, incentivize drugmakers to finish studying the medicines through confirmatory trials. The final pilot project is designed to encourage Medicare prescription drug plans to offer generic drugs for common chronic conditions for a flat, $2 copay. The goal was to standardize copays for generic drugs and encourage patients to continue taking medications.https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/20/trump-executive-orders-health-care-drug-pricing-aca-covid-gender-discrimination/","title":"Some question regarding executive order"},{"text":"Minnesota - YES.

Can any prosecution of any high-level political public figure be viewed as non-political? I think It definitely is political. Ultimately, its the department of justice that prosecutes things on federal level and its undeniably is a part of US government. However whether the origin of the lawsuits might be political, jury examination of facts and conclusion is reaches is supposed to be the solution to this to make things fair. I am yet to see any proof that any of the OUTCOMES of cases against the current republican president are entirely political in nature - and I mean concrete proof, as valid as say a jury verdict (Id even take all republican jury that swore an oath). Is there more concrete proof of this that I am missing?2. Sorry I dont want to duplicate the whole response so if you dont mind please read my response to another comment here, re carbon dioxide (TL;DR it has been scientifically proven beyond reasonable doubt that 1. Carbon dioxide in gas form in the atmosphere traps sun rays as they bounce back from land and water and leads to hotter temperatures and 2. There has been a steady increase of it in the atmosphere which correlates with human industrial activity starting from Industrial Revolution.)  So unless you have sources that top Harvard we can just take that up as a fact. If you do have sources Id love to see them. So to summarize, supporting fossil fuels industry ultimately leads to increase of carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere which damages global environment and its a widely, globally accepted as a scientific fact. So if you have a credible source that can outweigh global scientific community, I really need to see it so I can change my opinion on the matter, otherwise I am not sure where your information comes from so I cant follow your conclusions. https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/s/6rqeYe2sjHSource:\\nhttps://courses.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/Courses/global-change-debates/Sources/CO2-saturation/more/Zhong-Haigh-2013.pdf","title":"Executive orders question"},{"text":"They might ask him to not greet anyone...","title":"Harvard will adopt International Holocaust Remembrance Association definition of antisemitism"},{"text":"Thank you for this.I'm solidly on the left and I agree that most political spaces online have become echo chambers.Not that I hate echo chambers on principle, sometimes it's nice to hear your own voice booming back at you ?? Besides, as a member of the left, if there's anything we can't do it's *agree on fucking anything*, so even in a purely leftist space there can be a lot of enriching and/or frustrating argument and debate.However, I realized last year that I need to make more of an effort to understand \\"the other side\\", so I went looking for right-wing publications.

There definitely needs to be more *discussion* online, and I need to get better at inquiring about everything I read and not just *absorbing*. It can be difficult for me sometimes. I have a lot of strongly-held convictions that remain very unshaken from the info I consume, so I feel as though I'm not *just* inhaling and regurgitating. But it always helps if I have two viewpoints to look at side-by-side, or if I'm able to consume more 'neutral' media. Which, unfortunately I believe is a dying art.

[Hate Speech Excuse](https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/reddit-bans-pro-trump-forum-the_donald-communities-promote-hate/). True hatred is on display in every subreddit, where especially now given Trumps Inauguration, Republicans are labeled nazis, deplorable, idiots, and called extremists just for supporting the GOP. But this hate speech is okay, and for reasons unbeknownst to me, we permit the hypocrisy and inconsistent enforcement of the first amendment to continue. Reddit has a well-documented history of suppressing conservative viewpoints while giving progressive narratives free rein. Major subs like r/politics and r/news are essentially left-wing echo chambers where any dissenting opinion is quietly removed under the guise of misinformation or hate speech. Go to virtually any subreddit and state that youre a Republican, and see what happens. You will be instantly bombarded with hate speech, disliked into oblivion, your comment will be removed, youll be banned, and youll probably get death threats. Need proof? Look at this study [Reddit Political Bias](https://news.umich.edu/u-m-study-explores-how-political-bias-in-content-moderation-on-social-media-feeds-echo-chambers/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) just conducted by the University of Michigan, conducted by a PhD graduate; he found extreme left-leaning bias in the subreddit r/politics, and how their content is moderated. Or, look at how r/The_Donald was banned, despite having nearly 800,000 users, while far-left subs that openly advocate for violence are allowed to thrive.  ?Even r/Conservative has to be heavily moderated to prevent mass brigading from leftists who demand it be shut down.

Young liberal voters are disillusioned because our leaders are too old, too tangled up in the web of lobbyist agendas and corporate interests to actually make progressive change, and too soft on the rising threat of populist conservatism. Older center-left dems/left-leaning libertarians dont like the tone of performative wokeness and guilt-tripping and feel outpaced and disillusioned by our countrys rapidly changing social landscape. And everyone, regardless of age, seems to feel like even when we hold all the cards, we play too nice, we take half measures, and are overall ineffective at enacting real change. So what do we do next? My parents (proud, lifelong democrats) and I often argue on whether we need to move closer to center or swing for the fences and go all-in on real progressive policy. I think theres a way to do both (as well as a necessity). Leadership should be laser-focused on leveling the playing field as far as gerrymandering, supreme-court stacking, and campaign finance reform. They also need to pick issues ubiquitous to the plight of all Americans like wealth inequality, climate change, infrastructure, and healthcare and find party leaders charismatic and genuine enough to drive the significance of these issues home with passion and clarity. And as hard as it is (and this applies on an individual level as much as it does to our leaders), we need to stop casting the other half of the electorate as villains and understand that everyone is welcome under our tent, even those that dont conform perfectly to our progressive ideals. Not everyones life experience allows them the clarity to understand the language regarding sexual orientation, diversity, neurodivergence, or any of these other seemingly new, non-traditional social frontiers. We can still govern compassionately and take steps towards the betterment of our most marginalized people without grandstanding and shaming. In any event, Im scared for this country. I dont know what damage the next four years will bring and theres a large part of me that doesnt have faith that reasonable people will prevail after this presidency.

Id like to address your points using widely accepted scientific data.\\t1.\\tCO? as a Greenhouse Gas\\nWhile its true that CO? is essential for plant growth, its role as a greenhouse gas is well-documented. CO? traps heat in the Earths atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect. This phenomenon has been understood since the 19th century.  ? Since the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric CO? levels have increased from approximately 280 parts per million (ppm) to over 420 ppm in 2024.  ? This rise is largely due to human activities, such as burning fossil fuels. Note: to your point, theres a big difference between atmospheric levels (bad) and it being put into earth as a fertilizer or even ocean (good) which causes the opposite effect by nature of not trapping sun rays on the atmosphere. But youre right I am no farmer. \\t2.\\tCO?s Proportion in the Atmosphere\\nAlthough CO? constitutes about 0.04% of the atmosphere, even small changes in its concentration can significantly affect global temperatures. The increase from pre-industrial levels correlates with rising global temperatures, as evidenced by various climate studies.  ?\\t3.\\tNitrous Oxide (N?O)\\nNitrous oxide is a natural byproduct of microbial activity in soils and water. However, human activities, such as the use of synthetic fertilizers and industrial processes, have significantly increased N?O emissions. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), N?O has a global warming potential approximately 273 times greater than CO? over a 100-year period.  ?\\t4.\\tMethane (CH?)\\nMethane is indeed produced naturally, but human activities such as livestock farming, landfill waste, and fossil fuel extraction have dramatically increased its levels. Methane is about 27 times more effective than CO? at trapping heat over a 100-year period.  ? While it exists in lower concentrations than CO?, its potency makes it a critical contributor to global warming.\\t5.\\tNatural vs. Anthropogenic Contributions\\nNatural processes do produce greenhouse gases, but human activities have added significant amounts of these gases to the atmosphere, disrupting the natural balance. Ice core records reveal that current levels of CO?, CH?, and N?O far exceed those seen over the past 800,000 years.  ?In conclusion, while CO?, N?O, and CH? have natural sources and roles in the ecosystem, human activities have significantly increased their concentrations, enhancing the greenhouse effect and contributing to global climate change. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing solutions that balance economic and environmental needs.https://courses.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/Courses/global-change-debates/Sources/CO2-saturation/more/Zhong-Haigh-2013.pdf","title":"Executive orders question"},{"text":"I just say - hey, you forgot murderer, cause he just murdered yall this election","title":"I love listening to the left refer to Trump as a \\"convicted felon.\\""},{"text":"Can't actually create something without Congress appropriating money.

There's room for all kinds of academic discussion about what we could or even should do.Inciting generally leans on 'creates imminent threat' along the same lines of self defense.  Would a reasonable person receiving that message be in fear(if they were the target)?  Or in terms of policing actual speech in public, inciting the actual mob trying to get them to do something vile.That's not really relative.  EG people can cheer on Luigi the assassin, disgusting as that is.Saying we can, should, replicate his actions asap, not so much.The second attempt on Trump's life for example, he might have been spurred on by such incitement, people who cheered on Crooks but also cursed him for having failed, and attempted to add people to \\"the list\\".This is all outlined in court writings on determining what is 'speech' and what crosses the line into threats and conspiracy to commit and whatever else.  This is just my ad-lib attempt to explain it.That could somewhat easily be written into social media company policy.  And no, it's not relative, that's what all the court findings are about.  Note I'm not talking about parties here, there's no qualifier that's \\"It's okay when we do it.\\"  I'm stating standards that are, well....standards.  These are not partisan standards.Now, writing policy is one thing.  Judging whether PostX violates or not, that is another.  There will be errors, and there will be some that don't get caught.  Same way reddit has rules, but execution is iffy, dicey, or as it may be, completely two teired.  That part of it is the human element.","title":"Is Instagram Currently Suppressing Hashtags or Terms from the Left?"},{"text":"No need for sarcasm, in response to your quip about keeping on.

This idea that it's all ideology and no substance is just on its face, false.genetic variability of important functional groups of specific human populations.You're going to have to be a lot more speicifc than that. Because it's well established that genetic variability is more pronounced within racial groups than between them. I've struggled to find any academic work on racial variance in responses to medication that doesn't look at social factors surrounding racial groups as the relevant factors rather than first identifying some genotypical marker that defines black, white, asian, racial categories etc then showing that that same marker changes responses to medication. If you have something to the contrary please send it, but ultimately if you think most scientists or other academxis see race as a primarily biologically determined thing, you aren't actually aware of these disciplines.If this is the spiel you've heard before, maybe it's because a lot of people are aware of this, not because everyone's too idoelogically biased.Its interesting, when children of African descent in Oregon showed poorer average results in mathematics, regardless of their financial status Please link the study you're referencing. Because the common understanding in social sciences is that SES often functions as a proxy measure for other forms of social factors that impact educational performance. Given that adverse social factors are what oftentimes mediate performance under the same circumstances. Race is a common actor that can create adversity especially for POC in predominantly white spaces, something more likely to occur when one is more wealthy.

Even if it is causing some warming (and as I said, there is little evidence to prove that) it is not a material amount. The best evidence is that the world has warmed 1.3 Degrees C since 1880. That amount of warming gets lost in the daily variability of temperatures around the world.","title":"Executive orders question"},{"text":"Yeah. Im not complaining.

You can totally allow both of the people (one being accused of false rape allegations and one being accused of raping) to both have the benefit of the doubt and allow them to live their lives without retribution from the government in those scenarios. I don't think it's ethical to assume guilt of the accuser unless they have been properly tried for it. companies don't view this person as someone willing to speak up when issues arise. They view them as the issue itself.Regarding this, my point was that even if the accusations were true and the person gets convicted, companies still often view such a  person not as someone who is \\"willing to speak out\\" but rather someone who is a \\"litigation liability\\" because speaking up means higher chance of additional court fees for the company.

I don't necessarily buy into the idea that it was?designed?to break up families, but it definitely created a system where fathers became, in effect, optional for many. It wasn't malicious intent, more like a massive, unforeseen chain reaction.The initial goal was to provide financial support for single mothers, a noble goal in itself. However, the way it played out is a different story. Studies show that the introduction of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), a major welfare program, correlated with a significant rise in divorce rates. While pinpointing an exact percentage increase is tricky due to various confounding factors, some research suggests a correlation with a rise of around 10-20% in certain demographics following the implementation of certain welfare programs. This isn't a direct causal link, but a strong indicator that the program's structure had an impact on family stability.Here's where it gets really interesting: human nature. We're creatures of comfort, and when basic needs are met without demanding much effort, complacency sets in. That's where the psychology comes in C the term for becoming overly selective or demanding is often described under the umbrella term of \\"increased optionality\\". When a single mother receives sufficient welfare to cover basic needs, the pressure to maintain a relationship diminishes. It's not that women are inherently bad or selfish, it's that the system unintentionally shifted the power dynamic and created a scenario where staying in a less-than-ideal relationship became less crucial for financial survival. We've all heard stories of women leaving relationships over minor issues C something that would have been overlooked before welfare C because the financial penalty for leaving is now significantly reduced.This dynamic has disproportionately impacted the Black community, contributing significantly to the number of children growing up without fathers. It becomes a vicious cycle: the financial incentives of welfare can sometimes outweigh the benefits of working and maintaining a stable family unit. And again, I want to emphasize, this isn't about blaming anyone; it's about acknowledging the unintended consequences of a well-intentioned program. Welfare gives women more freedom, more options  that's undeniable. But that freedom, without proper support systems and financial literacy, can unfortunately lead to unintended consequences, impacting long-term stability. It's a complex issue with no easy answers, and its made worse by the fact that welfare often provides just enough to survive, hindering the possibility of saving or building financial independence.","title":"The Welfare Conspiracy: A Legacy of Control From a Dark Chapter of History"},{"text":"Where does that leeway end?

The life ruining of a person that happens just because thet have angered another is honestly not worth ruining their own purity or their pride and mental health because of the claim implies that they did have sexual relations, albeit non-consensual.

They do not care if it's the only way to set your enemy on fire and they do not care that it's out of revenge.While false accusations do occur and ruin an innocent's life despite them being innocent, the answer is not disbelieving an accuser when they come forward but to examine how we research their case (if the liar is exposed) or how we treat a criminal who only hurt one person and the losses the victim suffered that are situational to the viewer (should they be convicted).

It was 4 years ago. Time to move on.2) Who said environmental protections were being rolled back? I have heard trump say the opposite. To date no regulations have been proposed to be eliminated so it is premature to assume that environmental safeguards are being removed. 3) Regarding EVs the point you are missing is that Climate Change if it is real (and there still is not any empirical scientific evidence that proves cause and effect.) is a worldwide problem. Even if the US could reduce CO2 emissions to zero it would not mmove the needle worldwide. China is building 100 new coal power plants just this year. Mandating EVs which are 60% charged by fossil fuel is not the answer to AGW. Here is a primer on the effect the climate change effort is making in the US.

I reread my comment though and realized it might come off as pro-capitalist. I'm actually anti-capitalist, I was just trying to make a more or less neutral argument about everyone wanting democracy to exist within their preferred framework.In regards to your comment about reaching the limits of where democracy can take us: I think of it more in terms of there being a profound tension between liberal (quasi) democracy and fundamentally antidemocratic fascism &amp;/or nationalism. So if things keep going in the latter direction we'll reach the limits of democracy. But if we can get things to go in the former direction, or ideally further, we won't reach the limits of democracy. But in both cases, since these goals are mutually contradictory, one or the other side will have to suppress the opposite side -- which obviously isn't democratic, &amp; contradicts the overall values of the liberal (quasi, small 'd') democrats. At the same time the fascist / nationalist side will continue to democratic means to enact their antidemocratic agenda -- which *also* contradicts *their* values. So the existence of, and historically privileged position of  (classically) liberal (quasi) democratic norms &amp; laws prevents either side from acting consistently with their values and still succeeding. If the liberal democrats strictly adhere to their value of free speech, the reliance on the \\"market place of ideas\\", and democratic tolerance then they'll lose to the fascists / nationalists who cynically exploit those norms/values to win and then totally undermine those norms &amp; values. On the other hand if the fascists / nationalists had strictly adhered to their values of authoritarianism &amp; autocracy from the beginning then wouldn't have been able to access the machinery of power (the gov't) and enact *their* agenda.

Democracy is better than pure dictatorship.  It rotates new people and new ideas in, and holds some accountability to them.  Most people who vote, only vote in the presidential campaign.  And those people are hand picked by insiders.  Generally speaking, who knows who the hell we are voting for....its all propaganda.  I wish we lived in a world where people voted based on some sort of logical fact based evidence.  It's a team sport.  You vote for your team.  It's a binary choice.  Most people are imbeciles, who don't even think.  We get lucky to get what we get.Trump was elected, like it or not, because he has a following that will ride or die with him to the polls.  That is democratic.  Moreso than any republican candidate in recent memory back to Reagan.Now on the other side, lets evaluate the last few candidates.  Hilary was chosen to be the one, and we all learned about super delegates, who are above the voting populace.  Who knows how that would have went if Bernie was given a fair shot from the beginning and the propaganda did not favor her by a wide margin heading into the election.  Kamala was hand picked, with no democratic process until the general election.  Even Sleep Joe, the reason he won was because Buttigueg and Klobachar bowed out.  To give him more votes in the moderate side of that party.  Joe was neck and neck at that point, until the party decided they needed to push him more.These are all puppets generally pushed by two parties that want power.  The whole process up until we get to vote is tailored to what they want.

Because it was working in their sides favor, or so they believed.Because we know the alternative. We've seen it on Twitter, but the same shit has been around since the 90s in various forms. When an online community does not moderate, it, without exception, becomes toxic. Online behaviour is not like real life behaviour. In real life, a person can't hire an army of bots for pennies to scream slurs at their enemies. In real life, if someone bombarded a woman with rape threats, they're ending up in prison. Literally anyone who has used 4Chan or saw how Reddit was before they started banning subs based on content knows what this is like. When you let a bunch of Nazis hang around online, their content takes over because they spam it endlessly and normal people, who don't want to put up with Nazis, leave. The idea of the first amendment on the internet is an absurdity. I guarantee the result would be literally every single tech company leaving the United States, because a world where you can't ban spammers and bots and the assholes who spam slurs is a world where all their customers leave and all their advertisers follow.FFS, we literally watched this happen with Twitter. It was briefly profitable in 2019 and could have gotten there again before the Musk buyout: Now it is a massive money pit sustained entirely by Elon's wealth because, unmoderated and with the bans of a lot of prominent neonazis rescinded, it has become so toxic that it has no business model.

I think you make a very valid point and I must admit that I don't have all the answers regarding the best way to solve these issues, however there is something I still disagree with:And let's say the truth that no one is willing to say: *there is no repercussion for lying about this stuff.*There are enormous repercussions for accusing someone of rape (whether you are lying or speaking the truth) regardless of the outcome of the trials, similar to the one being accused. And because almost always it's a he said she said situation for victims of rape speaking up becomes a lose-lose situation as well.If it is in a work setting (like often in the #metoo scenarios) It's a stain on your record. Many people that finds out you were willing to take someone in the company to trial (regardless of any trial outcome) will label you as a hiring risk because of the potential of you being willing to speak up again when issues arise. Many people will assume you're a lying piece of shit who got \\"the fun guy\\" fired. If you have family or friends who will fully assume innocence for a guy who is not convicted, you'll be completely severed from these connections if you lose and additionally, even if you win a good defense attorney in these trials will focus on trying to make you seem crazy or unreliable, trying to destroy your reputation in any way they can because the reliability of your testimony is one of the most important things in your case. Because most sexual violence trials will not be favorable towards the victims because of the fact that it happens in an intimate setting, most people will never accuse an individual because it can completely destroy their own lives and reputation. These repercussions will be there whether the accusation is false or true. It's not a weapon with 0 drawback, it's a lose lose situation for both individuals. And the fact that it is such a both sided lose lose situation is why most victims never speak up.  Both sides, regardless of who is speaking the truth, suffer the judgement of peers and the damage that comes with it, and that will always be unfair to the truly innocent party when both individuals are accused of a criminal act (perjury vs rape). But I don't think it's more fair to take one of those individuals benefit of the doubt away.","title":"CMV: It is not misogynistic to not believe the accuser in every assault/sexual assault case."},{"text":"They keep falling in moronic fallacies.

Eric Greitens is actually evidence for *my* point, since Mr Greitens has since tried to re-enter politics with the backing of many prominent conservatives, among them Mr Trump (and was only really forced to step down because he was offered the chance to escape being charged for campaign finance laws, which is hardly the same thing as pressuring someone to resign).People claim they care about the upholding law and order but would praise Luigi for shooting/killing someones in the streets for sake of the greater good.\\"People\\"?

Republicans are interested, at least in the Trump era, in tearing down the ability of the government to function and in exacerbating issues so they can more easily campaign on them.  *Of course* you're going to find that more Republicans are people of poor moral chaaracter, or who view government \\"service\\" primarily as an opportunity for personal enrichment!

That's a CFR of 1.8%, which is lower than the 3.4% in the article, but it's the right order of magnitude The CFR dropped after the vaccines were widely available, of course.Overall, the *population* fatality rate for COVID in the U.S. was about 0.35%. They also state that it's incomparable to influenza and they have no idea how it works, transmits, can be stopped, etc.So, is there something wrong with what they're saying? Two years of COVID in the U.S. (March 2020 to February 2022) killed as many people as 28 **years** of average flu deaths. And for flu deaths, I'm using the CDC's estimates, which are much larger than the number of confirmed flu deaths.If I were to compare confirmed COVID deaths to confirmed flu deaths, then two years of COVID was as much as **140 years** of flu deaths.So, yeah, covid was much, much, much deadlier than flu.","title":"President Trump officially withdraws the United States from the World Health Organization."},{"text":"Cant wait to see some fat toothless idiot riding a mobility scooter being interviewed on TV and bitching about how Biden made their pills cost more.","title":"Donald Trump Rolls Back Biden-Harris Rule to Lower Drug Costs for Millions of Americans"},{"text":"I can't tell by the article.
