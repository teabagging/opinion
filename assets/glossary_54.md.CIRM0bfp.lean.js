The majority of their businesses depend on people buying shit...and continuing to be able to buy shit.The entirety of what domestic heavy industry we have left is dependent upon goods and resources flowing in the global trade system.No red state farm country big-ag players were ever going to be behind huge tariffs. We import over $13B in fertilizers alone, ranking 3rd in the world for fertilizer import. The impact would be huge. And that's not even taking into account the financial consequences of the deportation scenario that ag, and heavy construction industries will be facing.To sum up.

The most fundamental level, called primary law, are three legal documents: The Treaty on the European Union (TEU), the Treaty on the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and the Charter of Fundamental Rights (CFR).Art. 8 of the CFR already contains a right to ones own data. Based on that, a couple of decisions of the ECJ a out what ?a right to data means and what data is included have been handed down. Building on that, the GDPR was enacted, as a measure of secondary law. It sought to bring forth a framework to codify already establish rules, give clearer regulations, establish a more clear legal basis than just a vague fundamental right and establish a basis to enact further legislation about data protection on.But, due to it being primary law, Art. 8 CFR also influences other prices of legislation - for example, the AI directive. Or the Digital Markets Acts, which pertains to so-called gatekeepers. Theres also been a number of ECJ decision against Meta based in large parts on Art. 8, look up Schrems v. Facebook, or Schrems v. Meta on Curia. But other than privacy regulations, Art. 101 and 102 TFEU regarding cartel and anti-trust matters, also influence various pieces of legislation and are also directly applicable themselves.Ad 2: Yes - but an untrustworthy ally is not the same as an somewhat openly hostile nation. Again: To use ?the same reasoning as the U.S. would not be enough to infringe on fundamental rights, since the situation is different.  Ad 3: Poland already does have an outsized influence on Denmark via the EU. What are you talking about? And any Polish version of Twitter could certainly not be banned with the same reasoning as the TikTok ban, as that would infringe on the Freedom of business within the EU.   And this has nothing to do with the reasoning applied in the TikTok ban, but its just a more general concern about foreign corporations influencing public debate. And ?being concerned about just any nation having influence via corporations is not the reasoning of the TikTok ban, and would also not be enough to justify infringing on fundamental rights this extensively by outright banning the company from doing business.  To conclude, you seem to have a hard time wrapping your head around the fact that there are fundamental rights and freedoms in the EU and Europe which need extensive justification to be infringed on by the state and that the relationship between the U.S. and China is very different from the relationship between many European countries and the U.S.","title":"CMV: With the same reasoning as the US TikTok ban, European countries ought to ban American social media"},{"text":"One of the way it did so was by demanding US tech companies to build in backdoors in their products to which they would have the key.

They vote based on feelings and not a real understanding of how the world works. For example, in 2006/2007 Texas presented a bill to the voting public to make gay marriage illegal. Thing was, itnwas already illegal by not being legal in the 1st place and the bill had a bunch of non-related pork spending attached. The politicians knew it would die if voted on in house, so they circumvented that and put it on the ballot. The whole state voted in favor of the bill to stick it to the LBGTs without understanding what they were voting for.I am not advocating for taking the vote away from the whole population, but i am pointing out that the majority of the population is pretty dumb and easily swayed by simple illogical arguments.","title":"\\nHarris Sends a Message to America as She Certifies Her Own Election Defeat to Trump | \\nThe vice president said she was carrying out a sacred obligation."},{"text":"Then why is it that we consistently find evidence of the US already doing what is described, while when discussing China we're simply speculating about what they can do?","title":"CMV: With the same reasoning as the US TikTok ban, European countries ought to ban American social media"},{"text":"Why on earth does he think we would want merge with a country that just elected him as president?

Or the ads in which white women accompany their obviously GOP husbands to vote, blinking each other a silent signal of solidarity behind the mens backs: Actually, Im with her. The disobedient-trad-wives trope reflected Democrats conviction that Donald Trumps misogyny and temperamentnot to mention his relentless assaults on reproductive freedom and the rule of lawmust be deeply, albeit secretly, alienating to many Christian women. All they needed was a Liz CheneyCsize nudge to cast their ballots for Vice President Kamala Harris.Not only did that notion turn out to be utterly deluded, it was a profound misreading of how Christian women view themselves and their role in American society, says sociologist Katie Gaddinia mistake that helped cost Harris the presidency and could resonate throughout US politics and policy for years to come.This whole narrative was so laughable, and I can't believe Harris and others didn't know that.  It's like the Harris campaign was pandering, except .. instead of pandering to actual people, they were pandering to their own delusional view and stereotypes of people.  It's Harris and the feminist left who says that conservative women are under the heel of conservative men, etc, ... but that's not reality in the least, so Harris was essentially messaging .. nobody.  Messaging her own imagination.  Her own bigotry and intolerance.  Democrats are always quick to say that anyone who votes against them is (1) uneducated, stupid, (2) insane, voting against their own interests, (3) immoral, evil (homophobic, racist, misogynstic, xenophobic, transphobic, ..) and/or (4) being misled by evil people (Trump, Fox News, ..), and that includes how they treat conservative women.The reality, however, is that it's CONSERVATIVE WOMEN who are the heart and soul of the Pro Life movement, and conservative men are the ones who respond to their own women's desire to see abortion end.  It's really not that much of a different dynamic than on the left, .. where liberal men basically get cajoled and harassed into supporting the Pro Choice movement, because their girlfriends and wives would disown them if they didn't.  Conservative women are a lot like this, especially Christian women, .. they believe abortion is evil, that it is destroying the country, and 1,000,000 unborn babies per year, and that it is their moral imperative to stop it.  So imagine how these women felt when they saw Harris's \\"what happens in the voting booth stays in the voting booth\\" message, .. or how laughable that was to conservative and other men when they saw it ?This is just more of same, urban Democrats literally having no idea what is going on outside the city limits.","title":"What people get wrong about Christian women who voted for Trump"},{"text":"Its Nebraska so it wont hurt her :(","title":"GOP Senator's Husband Snubs Harris' Handshake During Swearing-In Ceremony"},{"text":"It will disappear and be shredded.","title":"Trump's attorneys have reviewed draft of Jack Smith's final special counsel report and want it blocked from public release"},{"text":"The EU was built under the direction of the USA and is pretty much at its service for most things.

Pretty famously, the EU is currently regulating US social media companies, like Twitter and Facebook.2. European countries do not operate on the same legal framework as the U.S.Theres the ECHR which gives everyone the right to operate a business, as well as the GRC which does the same.  Just pointing to the actions of the U.S. alone is not justification for the actions of a member state of the ECHR or the EU, and the actions of the state would also need to be proportional when infringing on fundamental rights. 3. The influence the state can exert over corporations in China is much greater and much more direct than in the U.S. So, companies and their products are much more easily turned into agents of the state itself.  China is not an ally of the U.S., but an increasingly hostile foreign power. The U.S. is an ally to many European nations - various instances of breaking international law and treaties, as well as spying on the whole citizenry and heads of government of their supposed allied counties notwithstanding - and does at least have treaties of friendship and support with the rest.So the situation is quite different, as the argument of a hostile nation gaining influence cannot be applied here.

There are practically no meaningful commonalities beyond the superficial.Edit: Replies to repliesWasn't Cambridge Analytica influencing elections on Facebook?**Yes. Consequently, Cambridge Analytica was shut down in 2018. It was a British company unrelated to Facebook.**Wasn't the US government found to be spying on Europe a few years ago?**Yes. OP does not propose to ban the US government, though. The US government and social media like Twitter or Facebook are entirely separate entities. Tiktok, on the other hand, is accused of being under the Communist Party of China's full control.**Didn't Snowden say Facebook spies on other countries?**No. Snowden claimed that the US, British, and other governments monitor likes and other activity on social media, often in real time, and can deduct a lot of info from it. Around 2014 he claimed that some governments intercepted unencrypted data; most social media started encrypting all data soon after. Separately, Snowden claimed that Facebook et al collect a lot of your data, which is true enough. He never proved or even claimed that Facebook spies on foreign politicians on US government's behalf.","title":"CMV: With the same reasoning as the US TikTok ban, European countries ought to ban American social media"},{"text":"They are embracing how awful he is because they feel providence is their birthright by being born a white male.

It still doesnt fit the sub.What have I posted that shows Im against other republicans or supportive of democrats? Again, the only posts that seem to be going around are sucking up to trump and Ive already made it crystal clear how I feel about him. Did I post anything that was pro Biden/Harris? No, I havent so Im not sure what point youre trying to make here.Let me ask you directly, since I get the impression you keep trying to imply this without actually stating it: are you a Republican? An anti-Trump Republican (of which there are many)? Because I would bet a lot of money that you are not, based on your comments not just here but elsewhere.Again, what comments have I made here or elsewhere that would lead you to believe Im not? I absolutely and unapologetically post anti trump stuff because, as Ive said many times, I hate the man. The fact that any republican supports him is just baffling to me. Hes played his base for fools and they just eat it up because he has an R next to his name. Im not a mod but as far as Im aware, you are allowed to be here as a non-Republican. But dont come here and concern troll whenever someone correctly pegs you as a non-Republican.How am I concern trolling? Again, seems like youre trying to say you cant be Republican if you dont blindly support folks that have an R next to their name. I wont do that. There are some truly awful people that are republicans and Im not here to take the copium and pretend that they are good people or politicians. This isnt about republicans good, democrats bad. This is about criticizing both sides. It does no one any good if you just ignore truths that there are bad actors that are a detriment to your side.As an example of what I mean, you responded to a comment asking why are there Democrats here? by saying oh what, so you cant be anti-Trump unless youre a Democrat? Republicans arent allowed to dislike Trump too? when the honest response you could have given might sound more like Im here as a Democrat because I want to talk about Trump with Republicans or Im actually an independent voter, but I want to talk about Trump with Republicans. Just be honest about what you are.The honest response is what I gave. Seems like everyone is caught up with accusing folks of being something they arent if you dont give your undying devotion and support to trump. Thats just not gonna happen for me. I would never be a democrat. At this point, its starting to look like two sides of the same coin but it seems like republicans arent interested in calling out the hypocrisy and wrongdoings of our president elect. We, and r/ Conservative, have a brigading problem where high-traffic posts get bogged down with comments from people (or bots) either pretending to be Republicans or doing what youre doing where they try to obfuscate the fact that theyre not Republicans, and they overwhelm the comment section with anti-Republican rhetoric. Even though you guys have tons of subs where you can discuss those things freely (and even debate those things with the other sidesomething I know youre aware of since you participate in multiple debate subs). This is our space. We dont always want to restrict the comments to verified users, but that doesnt mean we want to become someone elses pigsty. Call it a hugbox if you want, but we deserve our own spaces.I challenge you to point out comments Ive made that are anti-Republican and not anti trump. I dont think Ive made any. Will I criticize his supporters? Yep. Its important that people are aware of the facts and it seems like the vast majority of republicans dont want to or arent interested in hearing the truth because, hey, a guy with an R by his name won so of course we arent supposed to criticize him.Honestly, the comments that have been made to me are really making me rethink my political affiliation. If your attitude is indicative of what the Republican Party now is, maybe there really isnt room for educated women that dont just blindly follow whoever the chosen candidate is. Like I said, I will never support trump. If thats the line in the sand for Republicans, maybe it is time to be independent. I mean, Adam Kinzinger is someone I respect, especially since hes from my state, and look what happened to him because he didnt fall in line like he was expected to.  I guess I should say thanks for kinda slapping me in the face with the reality that there is no room for trump dissent in the Republican Party. Either you fall in line or get shouted down and forced out. Rather sad, imo. But, it is what it is, I guess.","title":"In 2016 some people and companies went out of their way to bash President Trump.

Immigration should be for skilled and useful people, its like a referal system with sponsorship and prob even have them stay in ur house and stuff. Problem is the illegal and unchecked migration. As for jobs.... plenty of people are gonna be screwed with AI now so its an issue.

V-coding refers to the practice of assigning trans women placed in men's prisons to cells with aggressive cisgender male cellmates as both a reward and a means of placation for said cellmates, so as to maintain social control and to, as one inmate described it, \\"keep the violence rate down\\".[120] This process has been described as so common that it is effectively \\"a central part of a trans woman's sentence\\".[121] It is common for correctional officers to publicly strip search trans women inmates, before putting their bodies on display for not only the other correctional officers, but for the other prisoners. Trans women in this situation are sometimes made to dance, present, or masturbate at the correctional officers' discretion.[122] A 2021 California study found that 69% of trans women prisoners reported being forced to perform sexual acts against their will, 58.5% reported being violently sexually assaulted, and 88% overall reported being made to take part in a \\"marriage-like relationship\\".[123] Trans women who physically resist the advances of other prisoners are often criminally charged with assault and placed in solitary confinement, the assault charge then being used to extend the woman's prison stay and deny her parole.[124]https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQ_people_in_prison#V-coding","title":"Trump-appointed judge allows transgender-rights restrictions in Florida prisons to take effect"},{"text":"Like (for example) in 2008 when 69.5 million people voted for Obama. 82mil eligible voters decided not to vote at all.

The immediately apparent damage done is to the affected tissue, sure, but the entire metabolic system of your body is screwed up. No blood can flow through cooked veins and arteries, what fluids that remain can just sort of leak out, taking away the salts which causes severe blood pressure issues, etc etc etc. It can take hours for a burn to actually kill a person, not to mention any infections that crop up.

Facts, logic, and the rule of law do not matter to them. They only care whether they win (which means they are right) or lose (which means the other side cheated).Raskin could have dissented, but it's easy to recognize at this point that it wouldn't matter one bit. It would piss off Trumpers because someone called out their god-king, and it would probably piss off a large swath of progressives for him only putting up token resistance to the election results -- too little, too late.And Dems would be walking a very slim tightrope to put up any obstacle to the peaceful transfer of power. It's an outdated and overly polite stance, to be sure, but the alternative if they make even the slightest misstep is a Constitutional crisis, and quite likely a violent civil war. And ultimately, Donald Trump won the election. That he was eligible to run was a systemic failure of Biden's DOJ, but we don't get do-overs after the fact.","title":"He Got Away With It - Donald Trump instigated a violent attack on the Capitol.

Myers wrote. This court, with due regard for state sovereignty and the independence of states to decide matters of substantial public concern, thinks not.Griffin trails Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs by 734 votes following two recounts of the results. But he and the state Republican Party have challenged tens of thousands of votes, arguing that they were cast by ineligible voters.Myers decision is a win for Griffin, who has asked the state Supreme Court to block the state from certifying the election results while it takes up his challenge.The court is currently composed of five Republicans and two Democrats  including Riggs, who has recused herself from the matter.Absent an injunction, the State Board of Elections could certify Riggs as the winner as early as Jan. 10.How did it get here?While Griffin initially led Riggs by about 10,000 votes on Election Night, the race flipped in her favor after outstanding provisional and absentee ballots were counted.Griffin then filed a series of sweeping election protests which sought to invalidate over 60,000 ballots cast in the race for a variety of reasons.The vast list of challenged voters ensnared people from assistants to state lawmakers to Riggs own parents.A News &amp; Observer analysis of the challenges found that Black voters were twice as likely to have their votes challenged as white voters.The challenge that affected the largest number of voters was Griffins argument that voters who did not have a drivers license number or Social Security number on file should not have been allowed to vote.State election officials say there are myriad reasons a voter may not have those numbers in the database  many of which are no fault of their own. But Griffin argued it could lead to ineligible voters being able to cast a ballot.The State Board of Elections disagreed. In mostly party-line votes last month, the board, which has a 3 to 2 Democratic majority, dismissed all of his protests.Griffin then appealed their ruling to the state Supreme Court, but the case was quickly moved to federal court.With Myers decision Monday, the case now returns to the state.","title":"Federal judge sends Republican challenge of 60,000 ballots back to NC Supreme Court"},{"text":"At a wild guess... fetal alcohol syndrome, various deleterious side effects of their single parent mothers use of drugs during and after pregnancy, bitter gov dependent single mothers in general, a lack of parental guidance in their education and moral development, cradle to grave entertainment industry psyops...","title":"Fantasying about Trump dying every morning for years."},{"text":"Avicci did make this video that is clearly about trafficking and people finding traffickers and fucking them up.

America has seen Greenland (and other European colonies in the new world) as immoral and oppressive intrusions into America's sphere of influenceThis made sense in the 1800s with the Monroe Doctrine, but it's completely outdated in 2025. Denmark isn't some colonial oppressor - Greenland has home rule and is moving toward independence on its own terms.

The option still exists. If he doesn't that's his choice and his responsibility.If all women just up and decided that they no longer wanted to keep men company the only reason why that would result in all men being lonely is if all men just decided that keeping each other company was not an option for themselves, which would be a choice that they'd make, 100% their responsibility because they could choose to do something else (i.e. keep each other company).Men need to consider re-evaluating the company of other men for themselves, and re-evaluating all the types of company that exist. There is value in platonic company between the same sex even if it's not your preferred choice of company.

After he won the Roman Civil war he packed the Senate with allied Gauls who supported him in his annexation campaign as well as both populares and defected Optimates to ensure their loyalty and he *still* got betrayed and murdered.  Trump has no such worries about betrayal and yet hes much less careful about disposing of people publicly once they run out of usefulness for him.  Pretty much everyone around him eventually becomes disgraced, politically ruined, investigated, arrested, or some combination thereof and after he croaks that trend is likely to continue.
