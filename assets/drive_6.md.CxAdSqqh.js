In fact, given that most VPs tend to run for president themselves anyway, their inclusion in these talks really shouldn't be surprising by any means. They can contribute to be able to claim to be a part of the Administrations wins, and if something does fail, they weren't the ones making the final call.For whatever projects and accomplishments she'd been heading at the behest of Biden the past three years, carrying out what are ultimately policy decisions he has to stand behind, the Administrations purposefully hasn't been flaunting it, possibly to avoid triggering the GOP to start claiming that Harris has been pulling Biden's strings behind the scenes all along gasp! They'd already tried doing that from time to time in an attempt to paint Biden as being unfit for office. Much of Biden's accomplishments have been met wit little fanfare. His team, Harris included, have been quietly getting the job done.Now that she's the nominee, she needs to be more visible to demonstrate her ability to lead, but she is still part of the Biden Administration and his policies. No, she won't be distancing herself from Biden's policies publicly and will dance around this question when it comes to certain topics like Israel.

There is no way the ATF wins this fight given the direction that the technology is going.   \\nWe're getting to the point where we have prosumer-grade CNC machines available that could make an AR receiver from a billet. Not to mention the fact that more CNC and 3D printed friendly designs are sure to emerge from the DIY firearms community.   \\nJust making it harder will not deter the kind of career criminals that would presumably need those to circumvent laws against detention in the first place. It will only deter the average joe who won't bother, but that average Joe is able to buy firearms anyway, so yet again, what's the objective? Does the ATF have any quantifiable targets for what they expect to achieve with this, or are they just throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks?I wish these arguments would give actionable data, as opposed to whatever they need to fit their agenda of getting more discretionary power. What is the **percentage** of recovered firearms that are **DIY** as opposed to **defaced**, for **every year**? What do they mean by \\"used in crime\\"? Illegal detention is a crime, all it takes is one big bust of a gang depot in a given year to make those numbers skyrocket.  \\nGiving 2 data points, in absolute values and without even specifying what those number even represent is absolutely garbage data-science and it's garbage journalism to just repeat them without putting them in context.Regulating non-pressure bearing parts was always a dumb choice, but letting the ATF play fast and loose with the rules to patch this gaping hole is most likely to criminalize completely innocuous enthusiast behaviour while failing to address the issue of stolen and defaced firearms or organized crime's ability to arm themselves through import, theft or self-manufacture.I hope this is struck down, or at the very least, that ATF has to make a clear case for it and explain how they expect this regulation to make the streets safer as opposed to just banning random stuff because it made the news regardless of any actual effects.","title":"Supreme Court leans toward upholding Bidens ghost gun crackdown?"},{"text":"Howard today is a far, far cry from Howard of 20 years or more ago. I dont think a lot of people realize how thoughtfully he has evolved in his words and actions. His shows are really a reflection of decades of changing attitudes in society and for him personally. A real sincere change in his thinking on things that he himself used to revel in.As someone born in the 80s, raised by older siblings from Gen X, started high school with Columbine and ended with 9/11, a lot of us have sort of followed a similar moral path. I think the claim that he has ten million listeners in 2024 is dubious, but theres a real specific generation of Americans that his words hit home with who trust him after all those years of seeing him mature, learn, and change.

Said he saw my bumper stickers (KY - both are from the 2018 midterms, one is pro-Amy McGrath, the other anti-Mitch McConnel). Given where I live, and the demographic of my neighbor, the distinct Kentucky drawl (which isn't as pronounced for most people in my city, but was thick on this man), I started to prepare for a showdown.Instead he said that he wanted to talk because his friends and family would react badly to this, and he wanted to get it off his chest. Said he had just switched party affiliation from Republican to Independent. Said that he had voted Republican his whole life, including Trump in 2016, but had say out the election in 2020 and planned on voting for Biden this year (this was before he dropped out of the race in favor of Harris).We got to talking, and we both kept an open mind. He's what I would describe as a true libertarian. He wants small government, low taxes, etc. General Republican talking points. But he also supports the LGBTQ+ community because, in his words \\"I dont understand it, but so long as it ain't hurtin' nobody, it ain't no damn business of mine or the government\\". Same deal with abortion access and women's reproductive health, but with more of a \\"let the ladies decide for themselves, they don't need another old white guy tellin' em what they can and can't do\\" flavor.Then he launched into a whole tirade about how he hated what the Republican party had become, how he didn't recognize the party he had joined as a young man. He had held his nose and voted for Trump in 2016, but couldn't do it in 2020 after seeing the corruption and abuses of his first term. And while he can't bring himself to register Democrat because of political differences, he will vote for them until \\"The Republican Party pulls imthejr heads out they asses and gets their common sense and decency back\\". Enemy of my enemy, it would seem.All this to say - this story isn't unique. And I'm betting for every story we have like this, there's one or two more of people who are making the same choice but don't have anyone to talk to besides their Trump-Republican friends and family, so they keep quiet.","title":"Kamala Harris' support among Republicans almost doubles: NYT-Siena poll"},{"text":"Sadly yes.

This is done deliberately for dramatic effect, because her friends assume that she was trapped in a hell dimension and they saved her by resurrecting her, an assumption that the audience is led to believe as well. This makes the reveal that Buffy was actually in heaven and was yanked out of paradise because her friends needed her feel far more impactful and horrible than they would've if we'd seen Buffy in heaven.

The idiots who believe that HAARP (https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/) or similar agencies can control the weather fail to grasp the scale of wattage involves in large storms.  The argument among the conspiracy-theorist proponents stems from a misapplication/deliberate misunderstanding of the so-called 'butterfly effect' in which small inputs into a complex system can generate large effects elsewhere.   Yes, there are physical situations where small changes result in larger changes - think a heavy bolt on a string where a little hand motion results in wide oscillation - but such systems are impedence-matched. The atmosphere is absolutely *not* impedence-matched, and can't dump enough energy into the atmosphere to effect the sort of changes the conspiracy theorists claim.

What you can mostly see is that in seizures of weapons from illegal gun sellers, the number of ghost guns has been going up geometrically.Here is an old writeup that has a lot of sources on PDs recovering ghost guns in connection to crime:[https://everytownresearch.org/report/the-rising-specter-of-ghost-guns/](https://everytownresearch.org/report/the-rising-specter-of-ghost-guns/)Since they've gone into business, Polymer80 now has 1.7% of the market share in pistols used in crimes in the US. It's not that big, but, again, why exactly is 1.7% of pistols used in crime not even being legally considered firearms good?In Canada, sometimes, in firearms seizures, over half of the pistols recovered will have 3d printer receivers. Remember that in Canada handguns are wholly illegal so there's literally no legal context for it whatsoever.I think ghost guns probably aren't a majority share of guns used in crime anywhere, but this isn't the point to me, the problem is that there's no particular reason why self-built pistols should somehow be less regulated than normal pistols, it just provides opportunities for using them in crime. You want to make your own pistol? Cool, it should be treated the same as if you went to the store to buy one though. If you're able to circumvent any regulation by building it yourself, for example having it not be recognized as a firearm by the ATF... Then you're not fighting for the right to build a pistol, you're fighting for the right to have a firearm that the ATF can't seize.","title":"Supreme Court leans toward upholding Bidens ghost gun crackdown?"},{"text":"Biden is bound by treaties with United Nations and United States.

We're all voting, relax.","title":"My Republican Neighbor Asked Where I Got My Harris Sign"},{"text":"Imagine if Episode 3 didn't exist, and if you watched the movies in chronological order, we go from Anakin marrying Padme to him being Darth Vader. Would that make sense in the narrative?May I remind you:Star Wars: A New Hope (Episode IV) (1977)Star Wars: Attack of the Clones (Episode II) (2002)Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith (Episode III) (2005)Yes, there was always going to be an episode three following episode two, but that doesn't detract from the fact that there was empirically a time when we didn't have those answers. The fact that we didn't might have reflected poorly on episode two, but it would not have really mattered to episode four at all.Consider this: The first movie, on release, was not episode four. It was *Star Wars*. People didn't know what to expect, and in fact were told that Darth Vader had killed Anakin, as part of the initial encounter between Obi Wan and Luke, where Obi lies to him and by extension the audience.The next movie throws in the fact that Darth Vader is actually Luke's father, and at the time that was a legitimately shocking plot twist that changed the entire trajectory of the trilogy. You could probably find online people's reactions to finding that out in real time during the movie. It was never explained fully; and it didn't need to be. The audience undoubtedly had a lot of questions about Anakin's past, and yet they didn't get those answers for another few decades. Older fans may well have died at that point, and yet there wasn't any major criticism of the magnitude of the plot twist.Now, you might argue that this is not the same situation, because we did get those answers eventually, but my point is that those answers aren't necessary to enjoy the movie on its own merits. Moreover, the withholding of character background can be a legitimate plot device in itself, if executed properly. If the prequel trilogy didn't exist, the fact that we don't have the details of Anakin's downfall wouldn't mean the sequel trilogy was somehow flawed, because the redemption of Vader at the end of episode six still leave us with a satisfying ending. Likewise, we may not know what caused Luke to change so drastically, but he still tried to have a redemption of sorts at the end of episode 8 when he went out to face the problems he himself was the cause for. Mind, episode 8 didn't pull it off the way episode 6 did, but that is more due to issues with the creative direction of the sequels overall, rather than this particular plot point.","title":"CMV: Having a main character go through a drastic change offscreen in stories is bad writing."},{"text":"The enthusiasm goes both ways too.

They've demonstrated repeatedly that they don't give a damn about \\"protecting children\\".The problem with these bills is that they don't really grapple with some key realities.  In some cases, it's out of ignorance (not realizing the issues), and in some cases, it's deliberate.For example: restricting children from seeing porn.  Seems straightforward, right?  Hmm -- who defines \\"porn\\"?  Some porn is very easy to define (because it's called porn by the people making it, it's MEANT to be pornography, etc.).  However, the LGBT+ community has known for a REALLY long time that conservatives want to define \\"being LGBT+\\" as being \\"inherently pornographic\\".  They take the position that you can't even TALK about LGBT+ people existing without that being \\"too sexually explicit\\" for children to hear -- that was the whole point of DeSantis's \\"Don't Say Gay\\" legislation.  It's also why conservatives rush to ban children's books/shows that merely show a family with two dads, as being \\"pornographic\\".Thus, bills that claim they're trying to \\"protect children\\" are really about restricting what information children have access to.   A whole lot of conservatives believe that if you never mention the possibility that anyone might be gay to children, then children won't become gay (/trans /etc.)Another example: a lot of conservatives define common-sense sex education as too pornographic for children.  Even though there are plenty of studies that show that giving children age-appropriate sex ed can help children who are being sexually abused recognize what's happening and gives them the ability to talk about it to trusted adults. Generally, the bills don't grapple with the fact that there are a lot of children out there who face struggles and danger from within their own families/community, and the internet gives those children access to information that might help them in various ways.  The kinds of restrictions being proposed give parents a LOT of control over their children's internet access, which sounds great in theory, but becomes a problem when the parents are abusive.    This is also true of parents/communities that are, for example, ultra-religious and who are trying to restrict their children's ability to access information from outside of the cult.There might be ways to truly put some guardrails on social media to benefit children. I'm NOT saying that social media is perfect, or that it isn't doing harm to children, as it exists right now.But I don't think the bills that politicians have currently come up with do the job, in no small part due to the biases and hidden agendas of the politicians in question.","title":"Hillary Clinton warns that allowing free speech on social media means we lose control"},{"text":"Maybe, but she wasn't ready for America :D. \\nImagine if her opponent was competent in 2016...","title":"America Is So Ready for Kamala Harris"},{"text":"Do you want a secret service investigation?

That seems pretty direct to me.I agree with the prostitution, but I think it needs to be regulated. One does not want the spread of STD's. regulated red light districts perhaps. I know the more conservative religious folks will object but moral objections are not necessarily logical and practical, so I tend to discount those.  Drug possession I agree with, although i can see how certain hard drugs change the person and may lead them to commit crimes. But then one must just treat the symptoms and not the cause, but on the other hand, alcohol absolutely can be significantly detrimental  lives in excess, but alcohol is not currently banned. Are drugs more harmful? Are alcohol companies lobbying to blame for this hypocrisy? That's a whole other can of worms.Gambling can be extremely predatory addictive and harmful and I personally loathe it, but I can see how one is free to harm oneself in that way. Just as one is free to eat junkfood even though one can get sick and even lose limbs and even one's life. Then again, the more people get addicted the more negative knock on effects one has ie more trips to hospitals more resources being allocated for harmful behavior. That's a whole other can of worms.Contraband, you noted that is ok as long as it does not disturb the regulation of protected industries and environments. Public drunkenness can be just about treating the symptom, the negative behavior that may arise as opposed to the drunkenness itself. Again, it's that balance of trying to treat the cause of something, but getting that just right is tough. because all actions can have unintended side effects. One has to weigh that with personal freedom, and ultimately i dont think that there can ever be a society with total freedom. Your rights end where the rights of another begin. You hint at this yourself as you acknowledge the indirect effects of things, and those indirect effects can become direct. A poster mentioned collecting rainwater or dumping oil. Individually not so bad but en masse can cause very direct  and significant effects. One has to weigh not only directness of impact but significance as well. Porn and homelessness I agree with. With things like porn and gambling I think education is key and even though the freedom to engage should be allowed people should read up o the deleterious effects of consumption. Homelessness should not be illegal. Another poster said that homelessness isn't illegal, but fining people for sleeping outside is making homelessness de facto illegal as if one is homeless one does not have a place to sleep so one has to sleep outside.To answer your question regarding whether or not we should outlaw something to avoid something else, the answer is maybe, depends. Again, a case by case analysis, pros and cons, scientific studies, need to be done on a case by case basis to weigh things up. If the scope of your CMV is to have unfeterred freedom, that is impossible, as actions will always impact others. Cause and effect is unavoidable. We have to take it on a case by case basis, and of course societal values have a part to play as that influences what people are willing to tolerate and or embrace. That is all being guided by education and science letting us know what the effects and impacts of certain things are and hopefully that education guides us as the intelligent animals that we are and leads us to tolerate and or embrace what should be tolerated and embraced.

We need reforms of intentional structures designed to ensure peace as well, perhaps a revision of the United Nations, or its replacement with another institution.We need to deal with the current crisis though. Our ability to do any of the above will depend on coming out in top in the current crisis. Otherwise the world will probably just fracture into a multipolar one like the Russians want, and Russia, Iran, and China will have more input into its final state than us.Key to victory though, will be solidarity between the liberal republics of the world. The United States, the EU, east Asian allies, and the anglo sphere - we must resist at all turns all attempts to divide us. We must prove our model and reestablish its desirability internationally. We must prove it to ourselves, and dissuade the fellow traveller's in our midst who have already taken the lies of the illiberal powers, have turned their back and already wish for surrender. It is clear to me at this point that neither of the wars are going to wrap up for years at this rate. We just have the morale to fight, and to win.

This isnt a knock on your post or any others, but Im having a tough time gauging what the actual difference (increase) is in the costs of goods and services (what you spend on food, etc.) and the difference in wages (increase). And Im seeing this claim a lot; so Im not saying its not an inverse, its the magnitude Im having difficulty pinning down. You note (and others responding conduct this same comparison) monthly costs have increased 1.5 - 1.6x since 2019 but wages have increased 1.25x. When reading or seeing this comparison, Im forced to assume the cost of goods and services and your wages must have been equal (the same exact number) in 2019 - as in, wages were $50k (for example) and expanses were $50k - thats the only way the 1.25x and 1.5 -1.6x increases make sense. But I know that is not generally the case. That said, if wages were $50k in 2019, 1.25x would be $62,500 today (increase of $12,500). If costs of goods and services expended (annually) was say roughly half at $31,000 of income, 1.5x overall increase would give $46,500 (increase of $15,500). This would be a loss of $3,000 annually when aligning wages and costs of goods and services.  What Im getting at is this direct comparison of percentage increases of wages versus costs of goods and services is misleading or doesnt really tell the story in the best possible way. Because say your expenses are only $20,000 annually with a $50,000 income and holding the 1.5x increase for costs of goods and services against the 1.25x increase in wages - you would be ahead by $2,500 more income than expenses for the year.","title":"CMV: People are letting Politics and Social Media ruin a pretty good economic run"},{"text":"A mile or so down from me, there was a guy who had made a giant custom banner that had a picture of Rambo with Trumps face photoshopped over it, firing a big Gatling gun with the American flag and eagles screeching in the background.

Also, there was this several hour delay from the event to the TV or print. I really think that gave reporters and editors time to validate and edit their stories to be accurate. Today, because of the speed news travels, reporters jump the gun to be 1st for clicks. Some of these reports are absolute garbage; grammatically and factually. Today a bad story travels the world because reporters are lazy and poach other stories off the internet and make them their own without fact checking. Again the money to be 1st drives this. I think it's all shady as the average American doesn't pick up on the differences of opinion vs news fact. It's not just fox, it's every major outlet that has news opinion. Personally, I'd like to see us have some well educated honest politicians run for president. I read more well thought out responses on reddit than when I write letters to my congressional reps. The choices have been abysmal for decades. We get slick talking charlatans from both parties. From house rep, to senators, to presidents. AOC and George Santos come to mind.Clinton, Obama, Trump, and Biden all are liars and in it for themselves in some way. Too many citizens are not demanding the government work for the people like the Constitution states. The govt. Is running the people, it's 180 degrees in the wrong direction. People like Gov. Doug Bergham don't stand a chance, but that's what we need. An educated, moderate that is kind to people, level headed, honest, fiscally responsible, and understands the world is a viscious place with bad actors and will keep peace. It really worries me that we have lowered the bar for so long now that people are going to accept this low quality of candidates as the norm. We must demand better.Hope this helps add some perspective. \\nAm I correct?

Both parties wanted the same thing, until Trump got involved, and now the Republicans are against more money for law enforcement at the border. Did you dig into the recent history these parties have coming together on issues? Republicans are focused on how much they can use their power in government to help their man Trump. I don't think there's a significant amount of Democrats who would say the same. The entire thesis of this commentary is disproven with one recent historical fact. The goals of these parties are completely opposite. Maybe the people following the parties want the same thing. But the parties themselves?

Consumers could save $1,750 annually on average on fuel and maintenance costs, according to a 2022 analysis by Energy Innovation, which would total $21,000 of discounted savings over the typical 15-year lifespan of a vehicle compared to a comparable gasoline vehicle.[1] For the more than 300,000 vehicle sales that have used the upfront discount to date, this equates to around $525 million annually on fuel and maintenance costs and up to $6.3 billion in costs over the life of the vehicles.Since the passage of President Bidens Inflation Reduction Act, the U.S. has experienced significant growth in the clean vehicle industry. In 2023, the U.S. saw around 1.5 million passenger clean vehicle (battery electric, fuel cell, plug-in hybrids) sales C the highest annual total ever, and a 50% year-over-year increase from 2022. Todays announcement demonstrates the significant related cost savings Americans are benefitting from as a result.  \\n...  \\nThe Inflation Reduction Act created a mechanism to transfer the 30D clean vehicle credit of up to $7,500 and 25E previously owned clean vehicle credit of up to $4,000 to registered dealers. This mechanism gives consumers a significant upfront discount and extends the reach of the credits by making the credit available at the point of sale rather than when buyers file their taxes. Researchers have found that consumers overwhelmingly prefer an immediate rebate at point of sale. Since this mechanism went into effect on January 1, 2024, more than $2 billion in financial benefits to consumers at the point-of-sale have been realized through the clean vehicle advance payment program for both new clean vehicles and used clean vehicles. Of the more than 300,000 advance payments that have been issued, more than 250,000 are for tax credits related to new clean vehicles. The option to transfer the tax credit to the dealer is very popular, with 93% of new clean vehicle transactions and more than 85% of used clean vehicle transactions reported through IRS Energy Credits Online involving a transfer of the credit to the dealer.Building on analysis from Energy Innovation Policy &amp; Technology, Treasurys Office of Economic Policy estimates that, when discounting expected annual savings over the 15-year lifespan of a vehicle, owners of electric vehicles will save $18,000 to $24,000 more than if they had purchased a comparable gasoline vehicle instead. Fuel is the largest contributor to these savings.[2] Although both gas and electricity costs vary markedly by geography, fuel costs per mile are typically substantially lower for electric vehicles than for similar gas-powered vehicles. For example, for a set of cars that have both electric and gas-powered versions, as of June 2024, the average gasoline cost per 1000 miles is $120 for the gas-powered versions, twice as much as the $60 cost for electricity per 1000 miles for the electric versions.[3]In addition, maintenance costs are typically 40% lower for EVs than for gas-powered cars.  According to the same report by Energy Innovation: Policy &amp; Technology, vehicle maintenance costs are assumed to be roughly $0.06 per mile for EVs and $0.10 per mile for gas-powered cars, due in part to expenditures on engine oil, transmission service, spark plugs, and engine filters.Statement from Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen:The Biden-Harris Administrations Inflation Reduction Act is lowering upfront costs for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, saving Americans more than $2 billion since January. These savings are giving consumers new choices and helping automakers and dealers to attract new customers and grow their businesses, said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. Consumers will save an average of $21,000 on fuel and maintenance over the lifetime of their vehicles and be protected from the volatility of gasoline prices.","title":"U.S. Department of the Treasury Announces More Than $2 Billion in Upfront Savings for Consumers on Electric and Plug-In Hybrid Vehicle Sales Under Biden-Harris Administrations Inflation Reduction Act"},{"text":"I just dont see how we can make any country bend to our will.

This obviously sends a loud and clear message to others.2) While Michigan has a large Pro-Palestinian Muslim population, Pennsylvania  the biggest battleground state  possesses a sizable number of Pro-Israeli Jewish Americans. Toeing the line between these two groups is key.3) Harris is going to make every single move from here until election from behind very specific internal state-level polling, and never get ahead of it or try to *convince* where the electorate is at less than a month before the election.4) If Biden/Harris come out TOO strong against Bibi, they'll be cast off as Anti-Semitic by the powerful right-wing media, AIPAC, and Russian disinfo campaign. At the same time, if Biden cuts off aid to Israel, I would not be the least bit surprised if Bibi stages a false flag or conveniently ignores intelligence data of another terrorist attack just to say, \\"Look what Democrats did to us, making us defenseless\\" = guaranteed loss. After all, we know this is how Bibi thinks: Ends Justify Means.So the best the Biden admin / Harris campaign can do is publicly toe the line but low-key signal and \\"leak\\" that they're extremely dissatisfied with Bibi.

Todays announcement also kicks off a public comment period to solicit feedback on the draft guidance.  Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Department is delivering the?largest investment in tackling legacy pollution in American history, including $4.7 billion to plug orphaned wells. Plugging is underway nationwide, and to date, the Department has awarded nearly $1.1 billion in grants to 25 states to begin work plugging and cleaning up orphaned wells. Since the enactment of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, states have already plugged?more than 8,800 orphaned wells.  \\n...   \\nOrphaned oil and gas wells are polluting backyards, recreation areas, and community spaces across the country. Many of these wells pose serious health and safety threats to air and water quality by contaminating surface and groundwater, releasing toxic air pollutants, polluting drinking water sources, and leaking methane C a super pollutant that is a significant cause of climate change and many times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Plugging orphaned wells supports broader Biden-Harris administration efforts under the U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan.   Under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, three types of grants are available to states to fund orphaned wells clean-up: initial, formula and performance grants. Approximately $1.5 billion is available in performance grants, which fall into two categories: Matching Grants and Regulatory Improvement Grants. In May, the Department released final Matching Grant guidance, and states can now apply for these funds.  States are eligible for two types of Regulatory Improvement Grants under todays announcement: * Plugging Standards Grants: Intended to incentivize states to implement standards and procedures designed to ensure that wells located in the state are plugged in an effective manner.  \\n* Program Improvement Grants: Intended to incentivize states to implement other improvements to state programs designed to reduce future orphaned well burdens. Under the draft guidance, states are eligible to receive a Plugging Standards regulatory improvement grant of up to $20 million, and a Program Improvement regulatory improvement grant of up to $20 million, for a total of $40 million per state. By incentivizing states to improve their standards, procedures and orphaned well programs, these grants will help better protect the environment and help prevent the creation of new orphaned wells. The Departments orphaned wells program advances the Biden-Harris administrations ambitious environmental justice goals through the?Justice40 Initiative, which sets a goal to deliver 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments to disadvantaged communities that have been marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. As of June 30, 2024, 44% of the over 8,800 wells plugged with Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds by states are in disadvantaged communities.Statement from Secretary Deb Haaland:The Department of the Interior is moving quickly to implement this once-in-a-generation investment in tackling legacy pollution, provided through President Bidens Investing in America agenda, said?Secretary Deb Haaland. Addressing orphaned wells cuts methane emissions, advances environmental justice for communities that have too long been left behind, and creates jobs. As we prepare to issue another round of grants to help states accomplish this vital work, we are eager to hear from diverse voices on this draft guidance.","title":"Biden-Harris Administration Releases Draft Guidance for States to Access up to $1.5 Billion from President Bidens Investing in America Agenda to Address Legacy Pollution"},{"text":"*\\"I was largely talking about the online \\"idea\\" of what people think of US and the freedom that comes with living in US, which I think brewed largely from people acting irrational/inconsiderate to others in public spaces and seeing that online.\\"*Can you provide some actual examples of whose view you are opposing?

And fear and hatred were never really Luke's problems: he is consistently good at confronting his fears and never really expressed much hate towards anyone. The Jedi (Yoda and Obi Wan) go on and on about fear and hatred not because these are character weaknesses particular to Luke but because (1) Jedi in general are big on suppressing fear and hatred, and (2) these were Luke's father Anakin's weaknesses, and they are understandably concerned that he will repeat his father's mistakes. Luke's own character weakness is his faith in his friends, as is explicitly stated in the films.This is all wrong.  When Luke abandons his training and rushes to confront Vader in Empire, this is him succumbing to fear and anger - this is the thing he wasn't supposed to do.  He *should have* had faith in his friends instead of trying to save them, and he *should have* continued training instead of fighting Vader out of anger.  The change he demonstrates in Return is being willing to let his friends handle the battle on Endor, and refusing to strike down Vader in anger.And if you want to talk about seriously glaring gaps in character development that have you scratching your head, the biggest one in all of Star Wars is Luke's shift from being emotionally traumatized by the realization that Vader is his father at the end of Empire, to having already totally accepted this at the very beginning of Return and already being fully committed to redeeming him.  When you say this:But now his character is completely inverted and he helps his people at the end of the arc as an expression of strength.You are actually pointing out how, if anything, Luke is written *better* in the Last Jedi!  The gap in the original trilogy is that we don't see Luke processing his feelings or really learning his lesson, we just have to infer that he learned the lesson based on how he acts throughout Return.  In The Last Jedi, we're not missing this middle piece, we actually get to see the trauma, the processing, and the resolution - all of these things happen on screen, it's a more complete character arc than what is presented in the original.","title":"CMV: Having a main character go through a drastic change offscreen in stories is bad writing."},{"text":"I object to post-birth abortion because babies already born are sentient.

They are acts that are not meaningfully criminal, often victimless, and do not explicitly violate others rights. However  they can be the most direct way we have to prevent the area of criminal activity we are actually worried about.Drug Possession -- Crimes under the influence\\nProstitution -- Trafficking, Kidnapping, Sexual Abuse, etc.Most of the acts you label as victimless are outlawed for such reasons, and there are many more that are controversial for similar reasons. Gun control, for example, bans certain victimless market transactions for the purpose of reducing later gun violence. Technically, even drunk driving is as well. Driving with .07 isn't particularly safe, and many short drives are successful with above .08. With harm reduction, the question becomes whether the burden the law places on the people is worth the harm reduction it provides. For example, we treat different drugs differently because of their potential for harm, which is why Marijuana legalization is more popular than that of heroin or meth. Even in the case of race, US law allows for exceptions to anti-racist legislation when targeting race can be considered a direct and necessary method of targeting the crime in question. Of course, this is effectively never the case, even with race-related crimes and activities.What \\"total individual freedom\\" represents is radical liberalism, of the type preached by select libertarians and just about no-one else. Everyone has a line in which an act is bad enough they are willing to penalize it without specific victimization. A totally free society would allow AI generated child-pornography, politician bribery (payment taking is not directly violation of office responsibilities), and would not have just about any of the economic improvements HDI and other metrics preach such as minimum wage, max hours, automatic overtime, etc. No practical society will ever choose to be totally free over allowing implementation of common sense virtue-based laws.","title":"CMV: USA is not truly a country with individual freedom unless victimless crimes are abolished."},{"text":"He already talked with Biden and he has the federal assistance already in place.

There are no post birth abortions, that is simply a thing that does not exist. As for third trimester abortions, they are exceedingly rare (1% of all abortion in the USA in 2021) and pretty much exclusively done for medical reasons. (Or ironically restrictive abortion bans, there's data showing them linked to increased later term abortions because people are having to wait or travel to get one). So if you're struggling on who to believe I'd always suggest just looking for the facts yourself. But one reason for believing the latter that I think is underappreciated is that the popularity of the \\"self-defense\\"Is this a popular framing?

At the end, you say that the \\"self-defense angle\\" isn't the most common argument made, so almost definitionally, the thing that isn't commonly made can't be as responsible for their opponent's widespread beliefs. But even putting the internal contradiction aside, we should look at the epistemology of the anti-abortion activists. I think we can realize that the distinctions don't make a difference if the epistemologies of the two groups form independently from one another.To get started, epistemology is the study of how people find things to be truth in regards to the methods, validity, and scope of information in the world to create their world views.One piece of the epistemology is going to be belief on the moral, metaphysical, and rights of an embryo. Another piece is going to be social influences, including one's community, religion, and information ecosystem.  There's probably others.For anti-abortion activists, the beliefs are formed from the religious, social, and information ecosystems they're in, rather than how well the other side constructs arguments. People's need for a sense of community and belonging will shape their world view. So, it is independent from the strength and structure of other's arguments. Being disowned from your social structure is a high price to pay and most will choose conformity for the belonging unless/until it's an item that requires them to be wholly removed from the community. People who are neutral on either side are the ones that will be swayed by the strength and structure of arguments.Arguing for/against the self-defense angle as you called it doesn't impact any of these causal factors. The entry point is going to be belief in whether an embryo is a human being with personhood. Most anti-abortion activists have never believed in the political compromise of the \\"exceptions\\" which is why they push their policy makers to have strict bans on abortion access.","title":"CMV: The \\"self-defense\\" argument for abortion; including first and second trimester abortion; is arguably just as responsible for widespread beliefs in \\"post birth abortion\\" and \\"late term elective abortion\\" as people who believe in these things."},{"text":"Can they?

You recognize what the explanation is, you have expressed that you aren't convinced by the movie's explanation, but you haven't explained *why* you aren't convinced.  What more do you need to see?From my perspective, it all made sense.  They showed Luke probing Ben in his sleep, triggering a force vision of Ben succumbing to Snoke's influence and becoming a Sith.  They showed Luke's reaction of drawing his lightsaber, and Mark Hammill does a great job acting out the sort of auto-pilot instinct of that action, and he also does a great job acting out this feeling of instant regret for the lapse in self-control once Ben awakens.  I don't know what they could have possibly done differently to effectively tell the same story.Regarding your idea of \\"reproblematizing\\" - you keep saying Luke slips up in the same way again, but he doesn't. He slips up in a new, uncharacteristic way. Luke's faith in the goodness of people is the thing that was consistent until the event with Ben, that was a brand new kind of slip.What's hilarious and ironic is that I have never heard anyone complain about the much more glaring gap in character history that occurs with Luke between Empire Strikes and Return of the Jedi.  Because you are correct in that Luke doesn't seem to really express much conflict over trusting in the goodness of Vader, he jumps straight from being emotionally traumatized over the realization that Vader is his father at the end of Empire, and then at the beginning of Return he seems to already be at peace with the idea and already resolved to redeem him.  It's exactly the kind of offscreen motivation-switch that you are trying to prove exists in The Last Jedi, only it doesn't actually exist in Last Jedi because they do show Luke's development on-screen, and it DOES exist in the original trilogy only 100x worse!It's just one of so many clear double-standards, it's part of the reason why I don't take these criticisms seriously at all.","title":"CMV: Having a main character go through a drastic change offscreen in stories is bad writing."},{"text":"A weeks worth of 24/7 Home Care at $35/hr (standard rate in my territory) is $5,880.

But if you look at minor petty crimes in a vacuum, they don't seem like a problem, but when you consider a world where no petty crimes are prosecuted, we lose societal order. Now that apple tree owner has to spend time and resources towards a fence or cameras, etc.--they could be expending efforts towards other efforts that benefit them and potentially society as a whole.

That's victimless crime imo (adult has no obligation to protect others' property) but at the end of the day it could still be considered trespassing and maybe even burglary.","title":"CMV: USA is not truly a country with individual freedom unless victimless crimes are abolished."},{"text":"It is crazy all these democrat liars call Trump a liar.","title":"Kamala Harris: I Have a Glock  Yes, of Course I Have Fired It"},{"text":"No one with a properly functioning brain wants another 4 years of Biden's policies.??","title":"Kamala Harris on What She Would Do Different from Biden: 'There Is Not a Thing that Comes to Mind'"},{"text":"In just a week- my Facebook account that Ive had since 2007, will be permanently deleted.

BAC is a determination of how much alcohol is in your system, not a measure of how drunk you are. They are connected, but not strictly. What hits you hard may be a tickle to someone else.

You are noticed when you are acting drunk and confirmed when the alcohol is detected in your bloodstream, or viewed drinking. If you have alcohol but show no signs of drunkenness, you are not drunk. The symptoms are required. Person A in your example would get a public nuisance charge, but not a public drunkenness charge. We usually use 0.08 for the drunkenness. Person B would also not be charged with public drunkenness because they aren't acting at all. Someone else is helping them. If they woke up and ran off, clearly drunk, they might get a charge.

It would require some sort of wealth test, and for people who have a lot of wealth that is mostly tied up in their housing, its a particularly difficult challenge. That being said, just because it because it is hard does not mean that we should not do it. Debt renegotiation is also incredibly difficult and would likely be tagged as a default by ratings agencies and so would have to be done very, very thoughtfully. I recognize both of these are much easier said than done. Sadly I think we have mortgaged the future and the future is approaching soon. I am also talking about a much more fundamental rethink than what you were describing. So security and Medicare is something in the neighborhood of $3 trillion today. We would need to almost cut that in half to even approach sustainability from a fiscal perspective. Obviously that cant be the only place that we cut given the size of our deficit, and our outstanding debt, but if we dont do something about it now, bond markets will make us do something about it in 15 to 20 years.I completely agree with you that theres no political reward for this.

A declining share of global production, the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the success of insurgencies in Vietnam and Latin America, and the destruction of the post-War consensus. But the U.S. system ended up outlasting the alternatives because it internally reformed itself.There's no guarantee that will happen again. This time, our problem is our failure to internally reform, while China is intentionally avoiding the pitfalls that destroyed the Soviet Union. But I don't think these narratives can be forecast into the future. There's another narrative, based on the same facts, that the U.S. has kept ahead despite so much internal dysfunction. If a political movement could breakthrough and become broadly popular enough to make the necessary reforms, there's a lot of potential they could unlock. Whereas China or even the EU are facing problems that are much more fundamental. If the US could pass legislation to address housing, healthcare, government finances, and the immigration system - they could all be fixed (or at least dramatically improved) over the medium run. But a stagnant/declining population or autocratic political system takes much longer and much more political energy to fix.Plus - the US and allies are on the defense. In the big flashpoints; Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, the US goal is to preserve the independence of these states. While our rivals (Russia, Iran and China) want to conquer them in some form or another. Israel just crippled Hezbollah, so the immediate threat from Iran is much diminished. Ukraine has Russia in a stalemate, so there's no reason to think a war with NATO would go Russia's way. Even without the United States, Poland has a substantial army that has been expanding since the war began. So the flashpoint where the US might need to dedicate a lot of resources to a direct conflict is Taiwan - which happens to be the one flashpoint where the American public isn't divided. China would also have to launch a seaborne invasion when the US has a substantial naval advantage. Even if they pulled it off, it's doubtful they'd be able to maintain transport lines long enough to subdue the entire island (which is mountainous), and the US could kick China out pretty swiftly.The real challenge to the US is nuclear weapons. But that's not a challenge from countries that are surpassing us, that's a challenge of countries that have lost threatening to destroy both sides.","title":"The Neoliberal World Order is Collapsing.

For this first example, I would say that no, we do not need to see the change depicted onscreen. I will give an example of where we would need it. Switch out the 18 year old for a warrior who has been through 2 wars previously, and returned untraumatised,  full of strength and hope. If war 3 is going to be the one that traumatises him, then yes, we need to see it onscreen. The difference is that resillience isnt built into the happy go lucky 18 year old. We have no reason to believe that he would be able to handle the brutality of war in any other way. The same isnt true for the warrior. If we have seen the warrior fight 2 wars unscathed, then we need to see the third war to grasp how it was able to affect him so deeply.2. I strongly disagree that films in general are meant to reflect real life, especially when it comes to fairy tales. Happily ever after isnt realistic, but it is an iconic part of fiction for a reason. Fairy tales and fantasies are meant to offer us a reprieve from the chaos of reality where a random event can completely wreck the status quo.

There's a way to explain it, I'm sure, if the writers could be *bothered*, but they weren't.

I have lived in almost overtly stratta of economic success outside of the inordinately wealthy. From.being homeless and eatimg out of dumpstersto going salmon fish9ng in deep water once a week on a boat That costs a grand per trip,  there is not a single group I've met on any stratta of economic siccess within that framing that is doing better and feeling more secure or even equally secure as they were 4 years ago.To add:Food is the most important category of spending. Food, then housing, then utilities, then leisure. If things have gone to shit in the first, they've gone to shit on all of them. If all your money goes to food, how much economic activity is there left for the rest. Acting like each economic factor has equal value is a bit shallow minded.Continuing that, during the great depression, at worst, buying a house was 80% of your annual income. Is is now in many parts of the contract well over double, and near cities, 5-10 times the annual income. This is unsustainable. Not to mention the drastic rise in rent. Over 4 years I worked my ass off to double my wages to afford rent in the locations I preferred, and the rent for those locations has more than doubled, in some cases tripled.There is no world where a rational person who is truly knowledgeable of the plight of the lower and middle classes could ever say things are good or even the same as they were 4. 9, or even 12 years ago.I know so many people who after losing their homes in the 2008 financial crisis, who are now making much better financial decisions, who are drowning in costs of living. Families making 100k a year who can barely afford their apartments along with food costs.These numbers and perspective do not reflect the reality on the ground, and that is I think the major issue here. Your average American is desperate for help while being told to work harder, yet there are doctors I've known thay are finding it hard to own property or move die to both astronomical costs, massive student debts, and high interest rates.It will take some  very convincing argumentation in support of real stats for me to believe otherwise.I've been having these condos while on a cruise while the wife is asleep, and from ever economic stratta from every country of origin I've spoken with, at least in thenwestern world, the sentiment I the same. It seems even the causes of the issues seem to be the same.Governments have condemned their populations in order to inflate economics numbers by stimulating the spending lower of foreign national ls without air borders, then using those numbers to pretend everything I fine while we put a bandaid over a festering open wound.","title":"CMV: People are letting Politics and Social Media ruin a pretty good economic run"},{"text":"He backed out because they were going to fact check","title":"Trump Gets Unhinged, Even for Him, Over Kamala Harris 60 Minutes Interview"},{"text":"No. Starting in 2018 the Democrats have made massive gains among white voters with a college degree (which were a Republican demo in 2012), with her leading that demo by 18 points (Biden won them by 9 in 2020), and she is up 21 points among *all voters* with a college degree, and they will make up 41% of the electorate. The reason she is ahead in the Rustbelt states is because of the very strong support of suburban voters who tend to have college degrees. In order for Trump to win the Rustbelt he needs massive turnout in rural counties, while also hoping for either depressed turnout in the metro areas and their suburbs, or a massive increase in support from minority voters (which he is not seeing in public polls of black voters in battleground states).Edit: could Trump win?

Any lack of continuity or plot holes have been filled in with video games, comic books, novelizations, etc. The poor writing is a feature, not a bug.But going back to your top line:a main character go through a drastic change offscreen in stories is bad writing.There's ways story tellers can utilize off screen changes. One is with forms of non linear story telling especially time jumps. Say a story starts with a character that's all mean and jaded. Then you get glimpses of a tragedy. And that's hinted at and talked about through the story - that's a great example that shows a natural progression and passage of time even though you don't have to show the underlying tragedy to impact it.Other examples can include for pacing. Going back to Star Wars - but other examples like in Dragon Ball Z, or others - can have training monologues. So you set up that the character will skill up in some fashion but you fast forward it so the whole show isn't just a training video. The most entertaining aspect is probably a plot twist. So you have two characters that are buds and then one bud betrays the other.

And Vader is technically family, but is not someone that Luke actually knows. Ben Solo is probably the most precious person to Luke outside of Leia and Han so it makes sense that he is afraid of him being corrupted and afraid of failing as a teacher and failing at rebuilding the Jedi. Luke's prodigous connect to The Force doesn't automatically make him a great trainer of jedi.I agree with all of that. But I don't see how that changes what I said. Luke went all out for Vader who he barely knew, if Ben fell I'd be surprised that he'd just give up. That's the part I don't get. Luke not being perfect is a big plus for me. But what you wrote to me makes it seem even more odd that he'd just give up on not just Ben but his other 3 living padawans. At the very least for their sake he shouldn't have just dissapeared. There are enormous differences to the galactic conflicts between the two periods that Luke is the Last Jedi. There is a Sith emperor on the throne who is a clear and present danger to anybody who loves freedom in the original triology. There is no such clear and present danger involving force users in the sequel trilogy. Luke (incorrectly) sees that training future jedi runs the risk of having them fall to the dark side and doesn't trust himself after his failure with Ben to do so.Sure and yet when Rey shows up and tells him \\"everyone you love is in serious danger\\" he doesn't seem to react with any sense of urgency. Give up on the Jedi by all means but I don't see why he gives up on everything altogether. its been a while since I saw the movie but I don't think Luke ever says the jedi way of approaching the force is \\"wrong\\". Just that he is not the right one to train new jedi because he had failed as a teacher and failed the jedi way.I think I'm attributnig som of Yoda's character in that movie to him then. My mistake. He's ashamed. They trusted their only child to him and he feels that he provoked him into running away with the star wars equivalent of a motorcycle gang. Leia and Han have forgiven him, but he hasn't forgiven himself and he can't imagine that they would forgive him. It is also not clear \\"why\\" they need him, especially because the primary darksider he would need to face is his nephew. The darksider that he feels responsible for creating. Luke Skywalker at the end of the OT was a symbol of hope, but with his failure at rebuilding the Jedi Order, he feels that he can't live up to that.To an extent I really get that. \\"the master who loved his disciple like a son and can't bear to strike him down.\\" I get that mentality to some degree. I just don't see how this one incident makes him go to that extreme. Again if I misremember correct me but it doesn't feel like the film hints at underlying issues. Things were mostly okay, then one terrible moment happened, then Luke gave up. I want a few more pieces in those gaps that drives hom why Luke just gave up. I know it hurts and stings, but I just don't feel that the reaction would have been Luke's first choice.","title":"CMV: Having a main character go through a drastic change offscreen in stories is bad writing."},{"text":"Shared housing is a good point.

Because you are, of course, making a very broad statement about any main character changing drastically off screen being bad writing, and we don't need to get bogged down in the details of this specific instance. With that in mind, a couple things:1. Does your view require that change be depicted on screen, or are you merely asking for an explanation? For example, if a main character goes off to war a happy-go-lucky 18 year old and returns a traumatized shell of himself, do you really need to *see onscreen* what he experienced in war that led to this change? Because that's what your view is arguing here, but I don't think that's necessary at all to write a great story.2. Films are meant to reflect real life, and in real life we often don't have insight into what people have experienced that may influence their behavior, perspective, choices, etc., right? In fact, most of the time with most people we interact with, there's a huge \\"black box\\" of unknown experiences that we're left to wonder about or fill in. If films depicted on screen everything that influenced a character, explaining all of their choices and changes, this leaves no room to explore this aspect of the human experience within filmmaking.","title":"CMV: Having a main character go through a drastic change offscreen in stories is bad writing."},{"text":"The irony of this being locked behind a paywall.","title":"Kamala Harris Struggling to Break Through With Working Class, Democrats Fear"},{"text":"Making sense of the United States of America is clear when you think as a peasant instead of a Democracy enjoyer.

Luke faced down a fully fallen Darth Vader with a refusal to fight him and instead risked dying to bring him back. To go from that to raising a lightsaber at a disciple isn't explained what drove him that farWe do, he tries his best, but in the moment of fear and anger goes apeshit for a while until he realises what he's doing is wrong, just like in the sequel trilogy. Also during his confrontation with emperor he is tortured so badly his father does a 180 in his characterisation, so there's good reason to believe that might make him hesitant to repeat the whole scene.3. The connection between the death of the Jedi and his issues with Ben never connected. Luke raised his lightsaber at Kylo, therefore the Jedi way is wrong. How? The Jedi way would have told him to do exactly the opposite. If you want Luke to give up his Jedi ways, explain why they are flawed. An action he took against the way doesn't prove the way is broken. For context I fully believe the Jedi are dumb in many ways but this wasn't one of those ways.The way of the jedi throughout the series seems to be to murder your opponents and rule with violence. Both Obi Wan and Yoda were in favour of killing Vader (the former also crippled him) and before that jedi pretty much ruled the galaxy as a militaristic order. So even if they preached something else it always came down to just being stronger than the enemy. That's also why I love Luke Vs Kylo \\"fight\\". He doesn't use violence, and wins not because he's stronger but because his opponent is a sith, turning Kylo's anger and fear from a weapon into a weakness.","title":"CMV: Having a main character go through a drastic change offscreen in stories is bad writing."},{"text":"Wow.

And I get it, the Return of the Jedi ends on such an immaculate emotional high that it's natural to believe that Luke will go on to become the perfect Jedi master, on the same level as Yoda and Obi Wan.  But when old characters get revisited in a new story, you have to re-problematize them, they need to have new conflicts and/or revisit old conflicts.  It is entirely appropriate for the writers to have Luke re-confront the fear and anger that he struggled with before, this time in the context of not being able to rely on his masters and having to be the master himself.","title":"CMV: Having a main character go through a drastic change offscreen in stories is bad writing."},{"text":"What you get from freezing characters in time is the satisfaction of a completed character arc and narrative cohesion you dont get in the chaos of reality.

Luke faced down a fully fallen Darth Vader with a refusal to fight him and instead risked dying to bring him back. To go from that to raising a lightsaber at a disciple isn't explained what drove him that farIt's explained perfectly, he keeps having force-visions of Ben/Kylo Ren murdering his padawans.  And just because a character learns a lesson once doesn't mean they will never have to learn it again.  That's part of Luke's conflict: he is facing the same moral challenge as before, but now he is the only one in charge, he has no Yoda or Obi Wan to guide him.  He has to be the master teaching his disciples how to overcome fear and hatred, but he is still also struggling with his own fear and hatred.We know how Luke reacts to being the Last Jedi. He's been the last before and he didn't give an inch. He pursued the saving of others and revival of the Jedi. To go from that to abandonding Kylo, his 3 still living padawans and hiding nowhere is a leap without explanation.They also explained this perfectly, it follows logically from the first point above: Luke feels like he struggles too much with his own feelings to be able to continue to train others.  The connection between the death of the Jedi and his issues with Ben never connected. Luke raised his lightsaber at Kylo, therefore the Jedi way is wrong. How? The Jedi way would have told him to do exactly the opposite. If you want Luke to give up his Jedi ways, explain why they are flawed. An action he took against the way doesn't prove the way is broken. For context I fully believe the Jedi are dumb in many ways but this wasn't one of those ways.I think it was pretty clear that Luke felt responsible for training Kylo Ren to be powerful in the force, making him feel complicit in creating another Sith tyrant.  This is why Luke comes to believe that the Jedi should fade away: 1) he can't handle training new Jedi alone, without the guidance of his former masters, and 2) he comes to believe that training Jedi necessarily means that new Sith will emerge in the process.We know how he reacts to people and family in need. Even with all this happening the idea that Luke would hear the words \\"Your sister and Han need you\\" and go \\"hard pass\\" is completely wild to me. He's not a jedi, fine. Does that mean he simply does nothing to help all those people?This one is extra silly.  Why are you just ignoring that his whole character arc resolves with him helping his people?

The American dream is not being handed a house by the government.  It's the opportunity to earn your way towards it, without being held back by the powers that be, especially oppressive rulers.Don't confuse democracy, that is, majority rule, with protection of your property, like your house and savings.  Democracy feeds off of your property.Democracy enables the growth of government spending, as politicians realize that the surest way to get re-elected is to offer free stuff, which means stuff paid by your countrymen and countrywomen, but for your enjoyment.  It ultimately kills the productive engine.  Over the last century and a half, we've gone from 5-10% of GDP gov't spending to around half (I saw high 40s last I checked).While both parties are guilty of this (for re-election), one does it much more consistently and more dramatically, with far quieter voices about the insanity of all the spending.While I wasn't pleased with Trump way of handling the last election, there are many problems with the US and elections, including (according to a leftist Shahid Bolsen) US manipulating elections 88 times since WW2 in various countries, the fake accusations of collusion with Russia for 2016 Trump victory, the way the US security apparatus helped with the suppression of Biden's son's laptop story, which likely cost the Trump election.  Also the sudden new human right of voting by mail, when previously essentially there was no hew and cry over it, and the idea that expecting someone to actually vote at the polling station, I feel completely gaslit over it.  It never was normal to expect mail-in voting.  But it played right into Democrat hands.  There are dirty tricks all over.  Yes, two wrongs don't make a right, but if the goal is the achievement of something closer to the American dream, I think you have to question your assumptions about Trump.I still find him brash and unappealing, but that's a stupid reason not to vote for him.

Him being his \\"perfect self\\" after episode 6 and remaining unchanged despite so much more happening in the meantime would not be narratively cohesive. Did the change go in the right direction? Perhaps not. But to assume a 20-something person has no notable life-changing events during a time that is longer than his life up to that point, some of which are probably much more monumental than what he lived through, would be even worse. Imagine if Episode 3 didnt exist, and if you watched the movies in chronological order, we go from Anakin marrying Padme to gim being Darth Vader. Would that make sense in the narrative?It could, depending on how it's explained. The fault for that would fall on episode 2, though, as it sets a lot of things up to no payoff, despite it being a prequel. If you set something up, you need a payoff for it - that is something very different from what you're describing.

In one piece written in 2014, during Putins annexation of Crimea, Lebedev sought to defend the Russian Presidents actions, writing that Russia had reason to act following the ousting of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.Those who overthrow governments have their faults too, Lebedev wrote, adding in words that mimic those being used by Putin to justify his current invasion of Ukraine that it is not surprising that the far-right elements of this Ukrainian revolution will worry Russians, and that must worry their President.Lebedev also pushed for the UK to ally itself to Putin in Syria, writing in the Independent in November 2015 that Britain must make Vladimir Putin an ally.Boasting about his senior Russian connections, Lebedev wrote: I have no doubt, based on conversations with senior figures in Moscow, that the Kremlin wants to make an ally rather than an enemy of Britain.

I think Luke's development in the new trilogy picks up just fine from where the original trilogy left off, and the scene with Luke confronting Ben is an effective demonstration of how his character has matured in a way that made him more pessimistic and more hesitant to act.","title":"CMV: Having a main character go through a drastic change offscreen in stories is bad writing."},{"text":"I think its probably a mistake for your post to be SOOOO focused on the Last Jedi. Whatever your opinion of that movie (I don't like it!), its hard to really generalize this.Sometimes the point of the drastic off-screen change is to surprise the viewer (and other characters), and then you learn more about what happened later. But another thing that happens in both movie franchises and TV is that the writer just doesn't have control over which actors are and aren't available. Its one thing if you're talking animation or novels, but TV and movie writers are often working with constraints way out of their control. \\"The writers\\" can't control that there was a 30 year gap between Return of the Jedi and the Force Awakens, and you can't pretend that *nothing* happened. The fact that *something* drastic happened during that time period is kind of unavoidable, and you hire a writer to make the best out of the reality that you're facing.I think LOST is an interesting example. Love it or hate it, the reality is that there was a LOT going on that was completely outside the control of most of the writing staff. For the first 2.5 seasons, the networks were mandating that the writers plan on the show continuing indefinitely. Its also not really the writer's fault that the actor playing Walt grew a couple of feet between seasons, or that there was a falling out with Harold Perrineau, or that then he came back in Season 4. Reasonable people can still debate the quality of writing on Lost (I think it was mostly good), but there's a million things that you *can't* blame on the writers, and the job of a \\"good writer\\" is often to turn lemons into lemonade, and sometimes there's only so much you can do, and its easy to mistake good writing under hard conditions for bad writing under good conditions if you're not actually taking into account what those conditions were!Finally, sometimes there's just things you want to do in your show / movie that are hard to connect together seemlessly. Even if it would be better if everything was tighter and more logical, I think \\"bad writing\\" is often an overstatement. Sometimes the ingredients for a popular show are A and C, and the writers have great ideas for those, but don't have a great idea for B which stitches them together. You could scrap it and do DEF which is \\"logical\\", but DEF might be a worse overall product than ABC, even if B has some dubious aspects. The \\"good writers\\" might wisely do the best they can with ABC even if it has some weak links rather than doing the more logical but less entertaining DEF. You sometimes also get a similar phenomenon with deleted scenes. There might be character motivation in the final cut that doesn't make sense, and this might bother you, but the 3 boring scenes that justify the behavior do exist, but including them doesn't actually make the overall story better. And sometimes, just *skipping* B and doing AC might be better than ABC. A good writer has to make these tough calls to decide what to include and what not to include to make the best overall result.Maybe you could argue some mythical \\"perfect writer\\" should be able to get from A to C within the runtime or come up with an equally satisfying alternative that hits every one of your check boxes, but failing to meet that ideal standard isn't necessarily \\"bad writing\\". Bad and imperfect shouldn't be used as synonyms. Most good writing still has imperfections, but if you hyperfocus on them, everything will just seem bad to you, and that's no way to live!","title":"CMV: Having a main character go through a drastic change offscreen in stories is bad writing."},{"text":"Didn't we already know this?

I believed in 2016 that he would do significant damage to the GOP and all the evidence seems to point that he did. He cost the GOP many down ballot races and may have cost the GOP two presidencies. In 2016, he was exciting, new, and unpredictable. He was also running against a uniquely unpopular and uncharismatic Democratic opponent. A man like Trump should never have been elected president, but the stars aligned perfectly in 2016. The overwhelming turnout in 2020 and the blue wave midterms were exactly what I expected to happen. I also predicted back in 2020 that he would try again in 2024 and hoped that the GOP would wake up to the fact that Trump is not a winning candidate. Unfortunately, Trump swept the primaries, and Biden's health was making it look like another perfect storm like 2016. Having Biden step down when he did was a genius political maneuver and I hope it pays off on election day. I feel optimistic for a high Democrat turnout, and while I know this is anecdotal, all my republican friends and acquaintances seem deflated. Trump has a cult like base but I really do think a significant portion of the GOP is tired of him, and are picking up on the fact that he is not as sharp or energized as he was in 2016.

So I'm not going to pass judgment on whether this was a good or bad choice in this instance. But in general...Is the purpose of a story to be a series of events communicated in as much clarity an explanation as possible? I'd argue no, while that's one valid goal it's not the only one worth perusing.But the job of a writer is to write the story in a way the compells the audiences attention on what the writer wants , not to simply demand that attention from the audience. This is done by ensuring that any gaps in the story are mostly inconsequential, therefore allowing the audience to be fully immersed in the current stiry, rather than desiring to see the part of the story that was skipped.Can you see any potential in using gaps in a story to make a story more compelling? For example a story about a murder where we don't know who the killer is? If you phrase the goal in terms of what the writer wants, then how do you know the goals of Rian Johnson wasn't to create a sense of disconnect and mystery in this case? Not explaining things can be a meaningful artistic expression in and of itself.","title":"CMV: Having a main character go through a drastic change offscreen in stories is bad writing."},{"text":"Intimidation is all it is. Just more rumblings of an demented mind.","title":"Trump Warns Its Very Dangerous For Kamala Harris Voters to Identify Themselves, Because Theyll Get Hurt"},{"text":"Very often it's bad writing, and I agree that it was poorly handled in your example. BUT - there are many common \\"bad writing\\" tropes that can be good writing in skilled hands. The difference is that a good writer will use them intentionally and effectively.For example: Gandalf went through some kind of dramatic change between disappearing and returning. In that case, the change is there for a purpose. It creates mystery and makes you wonder about the nature of wizards and what happened in the Balrog fight. It's purposely left mysterious so that your imagination can fill in the gaps.One of my favorite moments in horror movies is the end of the Donald Sutherland version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. It reveals a major change happening to a main character offscreen very effectively, as a shock that lets your imagination immediately fill in the gaps. If you know the scene, you know it *requires* the change to happen offscreen to be effective.In the case of The Last Jedi, the issue wasn't the change itself so much as that it was done clunkily. We saw that Luke was very different, and then we got an infodump of backstory to explain the personality change. Worse, the explanation given in the infodump *didn't match what our imaginations knew* would be necessary to cause such a change in Luke, a character we've gotten to know very well. If they'd said nothing, our imaginations would have done a better job filling in the gaps.Compare that to the change in Luke between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. From his first appearance in ROTJ, we see a major change has taken place. We last saw him emotional, desperate, struggling to control his abilities. In ROTJ he's calm, cool, in full control. It works because our imaginations can fill in what happened better than any on-screen backstory could. It was a natural progression of the character that *implied* a backstory we could imagine.","title":"CMV: Having a main character go through a drastic change offscreen in stories is bad writing."},{"text":"More fear mongering?

Luke faced down a fully fallen Darth Vader with a refusal to fight him and instead risked dying to bring him back. To go from that to raising a lightsaber at a disciple isn't explained what drove him that farWe know how Luke reacts to fallen family in 2 ABY (or whenever), before he is a trainer of any kind.  And Vader is technically family, but is not someone that Luke actually knows.  Ben Solo is probably the most precious person to Luke outside of Leia and Han so it makes sense that he is afraid of him being corrupted and afraid of failing as a teacher and failing at rebuilding the Jedi.  Luke's prodigous connect to The Force doesn't automatically make him a great trainer of jedi.We know how Luke reacts to being the Last Jedi. He's been the last before and he didn't give an inch. He pursued the saving of others and revival of the Jedi. To go from that to abandonding Kylo, his 3 still living padawans and hiding nowhere is a leap without explanation.There are enormous differences to the galactic conflicts between the two periods that Luke is the Last Jedi.  There is a Sith emperor on the throne who is a clear and present danger to anybody who loves freedom in the original triology.  There is no such clear and present danger involving force users in the sequel trilogy.  Luke (incorrectly) sees that training future jedi runs the risk of having them fall to the dark side and doesn't trust himself after his failure with Ben to do so.The connection between the death of the Jedi and his issues with Ben never connected. Luke raised his lightsaber at Kylo, therefore the Jedi way is wrong. How? The Jedi way would have told him to do exactly the opposite. If you want Luke to give up his Jedi ways, explain why they are flawed. An action he took against the way doesn't prove the way is broken. For context I fully believe the Jedi are dumb in many ways but this wasn't one of those ways.its been a while since I saw the movie but I don't think Luke ever says the jedi way  of approaching the force is \\"wrong\\".  Just that he is not the right one to train new jedi because he had failed as a teacher and failed the jedi way.We know how he reacts to people and family in need. Even with all this happening the idea that Luke would hear the words \\"Your sister and Han need you\\" and go \\"hard pass\\" is completely wild to me. He's not a jedi, fine. Does that mean he simply does nothing to help all those people?He's ashamed.  They trusted their only child to him and he feels that he provoked him into running away with the star wars equivalent of a motorcycle gang.  Leia and Han have forgiven him, but he hasn't forgiven himself and he can't imagine that they would forgive him.  It is also not clear \\"why\\" they need him, especially because the primary darksider he would need to face is his nephew.  The darksider that he feels responsible for creating.  Luke Skywalker at the end of the OT was a symbol of hope, but with his failure at rebuilding the Jedi Order, he feels that he can't live up to that.  \\nEDIT: formatting","title":"CMV: Having a main character go through a drastic change offscreen in stories is bad writing."},{"text":"Man it sure would be cool if we rounded up all these traitors, charged, and jailed them.

Ben, having seen this, also begins to study the dark side in secret. Now, when Luke finds out, they can actually have a confrontation about Luke holding him back.

When the government prints money, it causes inflation. The government planned on printing a lot of money and gave Fink access to it from the jump. He was consulted on what to do with the bailout money. He said: give it to me!Corporations then bought at least 40% of the residential property and were bidding on all of them. We bought a house in May of 2020, in Canada (where the government also gave Blackrock and similar companies money) and the agents phone was going non-stop taking bids. We got it for $443,000 and within 18 months, the same kind of house was going for $750k. The greatest irony though is that the people who supported the government's actions are now asking the government to do something about the high house price...that the government caused, with their support. In Canada, a lot of the anger has turned towards Indians. The thing is the government changed the rules so that anyone could immigrate to Canada with the lowest bar ever. So, again, the government changed the rules, made it legal for basically anyone to come in, and the public blames the people coming in.The next funniest thing is the Canadians think another political party, which supported all of this, is going to make things better. They are the same fucking people. They all agreed and you didn't hear about it because you only hear when they disagree on some minor nonsense.","title":"How Did Blackrock receive a $454 billion slush fund established by the Treasury in partnership with the Federal Reserve in 2020?"},{"text":"Goddamn, was it buy 5 get one free?Thats wild af?","title":"Trump Gets Unhinged, Even for Him, Over Kamala Harris 60 Minutes Interview"},{"text":"There is a union, based in nyc, that i used to be a part of.

Movies are often written from the perspective of one major character, and often the audience doesn't get information until that character does. Done skillfully, this can give emotional power to later developments, set up twist endings, and preserve dramatic tension. The most classic example that comes to my mind is [SPOILER ALERT] in *Casablanca* when we don't see what happens in Rick's apartment after Ilsa confronts him with the gun. Without that mystery, it would have drained every ounce of emotional power out of the climactic moment when Rick hands over the letters of transit and announces, \\"And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo!\\" Many, many other well-written movies use similar techniques. The many failings of *Last Jedi* (and to be honest, the entire \\"sequel\\" trilogy) are down to bad plots and bad writing, not to the use (or misuse) of any particular literally technique or device.","title":"CMV: Having a main character go through a drastic change offscreen in stories is bad writing."},{"text":"Immediately noticed this.","title":"The United States has sent $17.9 billion dollars to Israel since October 7."},{"text":"I respected it.

Like you said, this was 2019. In 2020, Trump was setting up the groundwork to claim the election was fraudulent before anyone had even voted. He then claimed there was fraud where it was easily refuted, yet he continued, in the process, ruin innocent peoples lives. He was caught multiple times trying to get election officials to illegally change the results of the election. He and his incompetent minions were spending day after day attempting to change the results of the election. I feel like Im missing something Oh, right, he incited an insurrection because his Vice President refused to attempt to steal the election. Had Pence or any other politician been captured by the mob who can say what would have happened. And Trump, as president, sat there and watched it all happen for hours.People arent denying that Hillary called Trump an illegitimate president as part of a scheme for her to steal the election. They just dont even know it happened. Meanwhile Trumps rhetoric about immigrants is growing more and more violent. Hes going to round them up all on day 1. The same day hes literally said hes going to become a dictator. Do you know how most illegal immigrants get into the United States? They over stay their legal visit. Additionally, Trump cited numbers that mean different things than he suggests. He counts encounters as successful crossings when many get sent back. The rise in encounters is also due in part to the fact that the numbers lowered during Covid. And lets not forget that Trump stopped Republican lawmakers from passing a bill that would have been the most comprehensive border protection law ever.Trump is out there claiming dangerous things about people that his own campaign has been unable to present any evidence of. Yeah, I think OP, and anyone who shares any appearance to an immigrant group should be terrified of a Trump presidency. Hell, we should all be terrified. Trump accomplished one thing in his presidency. Tax cuts that benefited the rich. He has grown darker, weirder, and more desperate than ever. He will almost certainly help through aid to Russia or by lack of aid to Ukraine (btw the money for Ukraine is spent largely in the United States. We dont send them a check). Trying to say Hillarys comments are in way comparable to Trumps is a nonsense talking point. Its not your argument. The truth is you probably wouldnt even know she said that if it wasnt part of a consolidated effort by right wing media to normalize Trumps behavior.

You don't want to show every little mundane activity, but you also don't want to have big logical leaps that leave an audience confused.  But, obfuscating the story also makes it interesting.Take Game of Thrones.  The pre-Robert history is never fully fleshed out.  We get bits and pieces as we go, making it more interesting.  Same with Darth Vader.  We actually get VERY LITTLE about his past until the prequels (and frankly the prequels killed the mystery).So for The Last Jedi - let's start here: it's a bad movie.  Period.  So many bad things.  In The Force Awakens, I was initially frustrated Luke was offscreen, but actually liked it, because it allowed us to develop new characters and gave us stakes &amp; a goal: Find Luke!  Luke is a bit like Superman or Captain Marvel - you have to buffer the main plot from him, because otherwise he just dominates everything.  It's always a problem with \\"super most awesome over-powered character\\".But really, you're now getting into some of the bigger problems with the Star Wars universe and story telling.  Kenobi hides out, Yoda hides out.  Sure, we can say it was for the future or Luke or whatever, but fundamentally it's all a plot device to give Luke a wise old master.  It never really made sense all Jedi \\"just gave up\\".Luke going into exile makes sense - he ultimately decides the Jedi/Sith religious war is bad for the galaxy - which could have been an AWESOME gray area discussion.  Are the Jedi really that much better I think it would have been cool if the sequel trilogy actually ENDED Jedis for \\"something else\\".  That felt the direction they were heading with \\"random stable boy\\" and \\"your parents are nobody\\".  I don't know if Rian Johnson was incompetent with a great idea or if Disney neutered him to sell more porgs.The problem with The Last Jedi is that it is just all executed so incredibly poorly.  I would be fine with Luke deciding to kill Ben/Kylo, but they just gave so little reason why a guy who thought he could save Space Hitler's soul (Darth), he felt murdering his nephew was the only path.","title":"CMV: Having a main character go through a drastic change offscreen in stories is bad writing."},{"text":"I don't disagree that Luke's change wasn't great storytelling, but I don't agree any trope is \\"bad storytelling\\". Bad storytelling happens when the storytelling is bad, not because there's inherently anything wrong with \\"character go through drastic change off screen\\".??\\n?For one, main characters going through changes off screen invites a question. Why? What happened? A better writer would have turned it into a mystery that is compelling and has a logical, satisfying answer.?\\nIt also gives the character a chance to tell their story, and creates an opportunity for the character to reflect and confront or show their emotional response to their change.?What if they're lying, in denial of what happened? The possibilities are endless. Even in your example for? Episode 8, it created a scenario where they can try to play out a Rashomon, where each character gets to tell their version of the events. How well it's pulled off is up to you. ?\\nIt's like \\"show, don't tell\\" shouldn't be the guiding principle for writing. Jamie's monologue on how he murdered of the Mad King was masterfully done, compared to if it was straightforward action scene flashback.

Luke faced down a fully fallen Darth Vader with a refusal to fight him and instead risked dying to bring him back.

He's been the last before and he didn't give an inch. He pursued the saving of others and revival of the Jedi. To go from that to abandonding Kylo, his 3 still living padawans and hiding nowhere is a leap without explanation.\\n3. The connection between the death of the Jedi and his issues with Ben never connected. Luke raised his lightsaber at Kylo, therefore the Jedi way is wrong. How? The Jedi way would have told him to do exactly the opposite. If you want Luke to give up his Jedi ways, explain why they are flawed. An action he took against the way doesn't prove the way is broken. For context I fully believe the Jedi are dumb in many ways but this wasn't one of those ways.\\n4. We know how he reacts to people and family in need. Even with all this happening the idea that Luke would hear the words \\"Your sister and Han need you\\" and go \\"hard pass\\" is completely wild to me. He's not a jedi, fine.
