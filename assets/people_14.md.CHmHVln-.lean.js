Directly because they literally run the hiring and promotion committees. And indirectly because they control the journals that publish scholarly work used to assess your value as an academic.The system is called peer review. And it fails when all your peers are of one political persuasion and actively discriminate against those who arent. Believe it or not, there was a time when most academic faculty were center-right leaning. What happened is that those faculty opened the doors for radical leftists in the 70s in the name of free speech, and then once the radical leftists got tenure, they closed the exclusive club to everyone else.Youll notice a trend. The few conservative faculty that made it through that gatekeeping system today hid their views by working in a neutral area until they got tenure. Peter Navarro is an example. He worked in a very boring area of economics until he got tenure, and then became political later in life.The situation has been made worse in recent years by forcing academics who just want to be left alone, to study math or cure cancer, to be forced to sign DEI pledges to get a job.So the first step is to roll back all the discriminatory ideological hiring processes. That part is easy. Simply mandate that if the universities want federal funding, then they cant use DEI statements in hiring. Trump could do that Day 1 if he wanted to, I think.But the next step, which is to undo the cultural group think in academia is a lot harder. You ultimately have to find a better system to replace peer review. I dont know what that system would be because the point of peer review is that non-experts cant very well judge experts in a field.But clearly you need some mechanism for external review and oversight. Not having external review leads to insular culture and groupthink. You see this even in the sciences. You cant publish in climate science without agreeing with the consensus. Even Nobel prize winning physicists have been shunned from the field and ignored because theyre not experts.I think if you fix the academic culture problem, then the student brainwashing problem goes away. But you have to first really understand where the problem comes from, because a reckless attempt to solve it could make things worse.","title":"J.D. Vance Was a Poster Boy for Yale Law School.

This means every choice they make is not their own.Two, Trump will grift EVERYONE.  He's a simple man.  He likes women.  He likes money. He likes fame.  His motives are as simple as they come.  He is a con man through and through.  For his first and second campaign and first stint as president, he profiteered somewhere north of 8 billion dollars from tax payers and donations.  This is 8 billion dollars that he personally pocketed.Three, Trump is aligned with Putin, period.  Anything Putin wants, Putin gets.  This by its very nature makes many acts that Trump performs as treasonous.  There is no avoiding this.Four, Vance will push 2025 agendas.  There is no half-assing here either.  He will push for EVERYTHING documented in that plan.  This is his goal.Five, while Trump is a useful idiot, Vance is a pure and simple puppet with the sole intent to be the arm of Theil and others to control the federal government.Six, right from the start Vance said exactly what he was going to do to destroy the government,  He was going to fire every single person he possibly can and replace them all with their own guys.  If you're curious what a coup looks like, well...(broadly gestures).  This is also exactly why they tried to reclassify federal employees a little while ago.  Remember that?  I do.

When you marry someone, there is a lifetime of family events and gatherings. What are you going to do for all of those? Are you two going to fight each time? What about all of your events - only inviting half of his family for all of those too? Is this about your ceremony, or are you really asking your fiance to cut off that chunk of his family forever?

But he didn't say that, he had to denounce Obama and allies as not as effective as himself, he announced when we would pull troops out of Syria (a handout to Putin, additionally), which betrayed the Kurds (gift to Erdogan, additionally) and destroyed any future alliance with this pro-American group in that region.  Then, in Afghanistan, Trump brokers a \\"deal\\" with the Taliban (a terrorist organization staffed with former Al-Qaida members), excluding the government, and set a hard date for troop withdrawal that would put the responsibility for it on the Biden administration.  Trump \\"gave\\" the Taliban 5000 prisoners from the Afghan government without even informing the government they were doing so.  That part fell through, pissing off the Taliban, and so they started breaking their agreement brokered by Trump, attacking Afghani forces.  Trump calls the Taliban \\"very smart, very sharp, very tough\\" while they partner with Al-Qaida to attack a government the United States was formerly supporting.  Many Republicans say the plan to move troops out quickly will embolden our enemies (which it did). Once in office, Biden commits to upholding the US (Trump) agreement with the Taliban, his main mistake.  Trump then criticizes Biden for not going even faster.  The Taliban attacks increase in intensity.  Biden commits to a quick pullout while Trump is announcing that there were no problems with the Taliban while he was president.  The Afghan government and our military experts said the Trump deal was poorly executed and set up the situation to which the chance of failure was high.  Maybe that was the plan all along?  Either way, Trump is/was either an idiot or evil (why not both?)Trump has put Democrats in a position of enemy #1 and has partnered with autocrats and thugs the world over, all while making idiotic deals.

People don't understand that China has entire cities dedicated to making this, with entire government made supply chains that US can never compete with, nor do we want to.

A Readers Digest article calls the law the cancer weapon America needs most. All 50 states now run registries to help cancer researchers gain important insights.July 1996: Sanders is one of only 67 (out of 435, 15%) votes against the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act, which denied federal benefits to same-sex couples legally married. Sanders urged the Supreme Court to throw out the law, which it did in a landmark 2013 ruling C some 17 years later.July 1999: Standing up against the major \\npharmaceutical companies, Sanders becomes the first member of Congress to personally take seniors across the border to Canada to buy lower-cost prescription drugs. The congressman continues his bus trips to Canada with a group of breast cancer patients the following April. These brave women are able to purchase their medications in Canada for almost one-tenth the price charged in the States.August 1999: An overflow crowd of Vermonters packs a St. Michaels College town hall meeting hosted by Sanders to protest an IBM plan to cut older workers pensions by as much as 50 percent. CBS Evening News with Dan Rather and The New York Times cover the event. After IBM enacts the plan, Sanders works to reverse the cuts, passing a pair of amendments to prohibit the federal government from acting to overturn a federal district court decision that ruled that IBMs plan violated pension age discrimination laws. Thanks to Sanders efforts, IBM agreed to a $320 million legal settlement with some 130,000 IBM workers and retirees.December 2007: Sanders authored energy efficiency and conservation grant program passes into law. He later secures $3.2 billion in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for the grant program.September 2008: Thanks to Sanders efforts, funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program funding doubles, helping millions of low-income Americans heat their homes in winter.February 2009: Sanders works with Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley to pass an amendment to an economic recovery bill preventing Wall Street banks that take taxpayer bailouts from replacing laid-off U.S. workers with exploited and poorly-paid foreign workers.December 2009: Sanders passes language in the Affordable Care Act to allow states to apply for waivers to implement pilot health care systems by 2017. The legislation allows states to adopt more comprehensive systems to cover more people at lower costs.Do you want me to keep going past 2009?

They grew up with a family love of Roosevelt and his presidency and expounded on that with their love of Kennedy.  They watch the evening news every night.  They believe everything it tells them.  \\nThe next set is the hippies of the late 60s early 70s. The hippies believed in living a rebellious lifestyle, sex with anyone and everyone, drugs, protesting etc.  This group grew up and decided to go into politics. They became the leaders of the Democratic Party. These individuals had children and taught them their immoral ways. \\nThey want legislation passed to put in place every type of immoral thing imaginable.  Drugs, sexual immorality, etc. Around the 1980s some of the older democrats figured this out and changed. They changed party. Abortion caused many of them to change party. This caused many Christians to rally around the Republican Party. They became known as the moral majority.  Move to modern times and we now have both parties congressional leaders becoming corrupt making far more money while in office than the money they make from the congressional salary. Enter Donald Trump he saw this corruption and decided to clean the swamp. Both sides became threatened by him.  The first time he ran they did not think him able to win the election but they underestimated his appeal and embarrassed them by winning.  So they hate him.  Even some republicans because they dont want exposed. \\nThe corrupt have control of the media and have the sheep duped. They portray him as evil.  There was even attempts to assassinate him. The old hippies want communism, and immoral things deemed ok. The corrupt politicians want to stay getting fat cash. The media wants their palms greased too.

So under that definition, people might not be called \\"privileged\\" if they're proletariat and not bourgeoisie. We'd generally call someone elitist if they look at a starving homeless person and say they're morally wrong for not being able to become a millionaire, despite the fact that that person has no education/little way to get that education- essentially, to be \\"elitist\\" is to not recognize your own advantages and/or to consider yourself morally superior for having those advantages.But \\"privileged\\" is just slightly broader than just money- \\"having special rights, advantages, or immunities.\\". I'm looking at, specifically, \\"advantages\\".The OP seems to be working on a definition containing not just financial elitism, but also informational elitism. So under their definition, looking at someone who knows the wrong thing and saying they're morally wrong for not knowing the right thing, in other words, saying \\"Educate yourself\\" is \\"elitism\\". Of course, one might be inclined to say, \\"But we have Google, obviously you can learn!\\"- and while true to an extent, there's something they're missing here: a lot of people just don't have critical thinking skills, and critical thinking is, itself, something you have to be taught- some people might have it innately, or they might've learned it in their life experiences without having to be taught, but the truth is that most people very clearly don't.Sure, they have access to flour.

The legal immigration system is one part classist, prefering more highly educated and wealthy immigrants, and one part lottery as the handing out of Green Cards and Visas is literally a lottery. So many qualified people do not get in even though they did everything right. Other people are just lucky because they had a family member get in, and so get to go in through chain migration. That is even more unfair than illegal immigrants. To me I had an unfair advantage to begin with, and my parents were just in the right place at the right time. It doesn't really compare to the different lives of illegal immigrants.

In light of the fact that for all we know, either of these issues could be considered a potential deciding factor, I think its silly to put all that much credit for the loss to any particular thing. I do think, however, that the trend we saw happen with every other nation world wide is probably a bigger factor than a small, largely identity related issue thats an internal issue.

If people have an ridiculously high number of misconceptions, then maybe there's something else causing those misconceptions.Let's look at this way- \\"Give a man a fish, he eats for a day. Teach a man to fish, he eats for a lifetime.\\"In this example, people would say that simply calling the man lazy for not having fish, or saying \\"Feed yourself\\", is elitist. And correcting individual misconceptions does- \\"usually trying to debunk stuff\\"- is essentially giving a man a fish. It does feed him, and it helps for a bit, but it doesn't keep him fed- so you might be inclined to look at that and say, \\"Why bother feeding him? He should keep himself fed.\\"I think the answer, here, is to teach a man to fish. In other words, to give someone with inaccurate assumptions the ability to correct their own assumptions- critical thinking skills. You'll have an easier time of things than either the elitist version (saying the man should just feed himself) or the gut reaction (giving the man a fish.)Of course, I think you can still go one level deeper than that, wonder \\"why can none of these men fish?\\" and support efforts to have critical thinking be taught in schools, but that might a bit of a tangent.","title":"CMV: educate yourself is the intellectual version of pull yourself up by your bootstraps and is elitist"},{"text":"Churchill, if I recall?","title":"Trump on Day 1: Begin deportation push, pardon Jan. 6 rioters and make his criminal cases vanish"},{"text":"Irrelevant old man yells at cloud.","title":"Bernie Sanders responds to his scathing reaction to Trumps win"},{"text":"pro-gun lawmakerYou mean like Kamala?","title":"Bernie Sanders responds to his scathing reaction to Trumps win"},{"text":"Do they mean Biden's great economy, and the low unemployment?","title":"Young Black and Latino men say they chose Trump because of the economy and jobs.

Economy always being #1 priority is for two reasons. 1. Its the easiest for people to gauge, they either have more or less money, and 2.

After every election, they wonder, \\"how did it all go wrong?\\" But they never come up with the right answers. Too many senior Democrats are just unwilling to move aside. I look at Pelosi, Durbin, Feinstein, and Harry Reid as perfect examples of keeping that power and unwilling to make changes to resonate with younger groups.

Then they want that money to go into propaganda in Hollywood so people watch movies with messaging that keeps them following the crowd. They want to split up the family unit so twice as many workers join the workforce for less money and the divorce rate will skyrocket then benefiting big pharma again because kids are using meds like adderall and SSRIs, women begin leaving their marriages and embracing singlehood by injecting birth control into their body which has been statistically proven to change the chemistry in how women choose partners ultimately resulting in more breakups and less successful unions.

We prosper, we change, we believe, we grow. No one is a victim, we are all in this together. Even if youre not a party to any party, they encourage independent thinking.

I was skeptical.   I did find this:  51% of populations across OECD and 51% in Canada can successfully perform tasks at least at Level 3 Level 3 is: Texts at this level are often dense or lengthy, and include continuous, non-continuous, mixed, or multiple pages of text. Understanding text and rhetorical structures become more central to successfully completing tasks, especially navigating of complex digital texts. Tasks require the respondent to identify, interpret, or evaluate one or more pieces of information, and often require varying levels of inference. Many tasks require the respondent to construct meaning across larger chunks of text or perform multi-step operations in order to identify and formulate responses. Often tasks also demand that the respondent disregard irrelevant or inappropriate content to answer accurately. Competing information is often present, but it is not more prominent than the correct information.Via: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/89-555-x/2013001/t/tbl1.1-eng.htmSo, a few things.   ~50% of the population is worse than level 3. Level 2 (83% of Canadians):  At this level the medium of texts may be digital or printed, and texts may comprise continuous, non-continuous, or mixed types. Tasks in this level require respondents to make matches between the text and information, and may require paraphrasing or low-level inferences. Some competing pieces of information may be present. Some tasks require the respondent to:? cycle through or integrate two or more pieces of information based on criteria\\n? compare and contrast or reason about information requested in the question\\n? navigate within digital texts to access and identify information from various parts of a document.(50% of Canadians are L2 or worse)My takeaway:  yor reading comprehension is suspect.  In the sense that you likely consumed a high pop article with a clickbaity headline but failed to vet.  I guess \\"functional\\" is a very flexible word, but L2 doesn't seem illiterate by any reasonable standard of \\"functional\\" that I would use.

Everyone makes and spend less, but if you have capital you can swoop in and buy while everything is low, thus making you even more money when the eventual recovery sets in.Stagnation is bad because it allows the asset holding classes to continue to stockpile and draw wealth out of the economy into their own coffers. This will eventually lead to an economy with no velocity of currency and thus a total crash or recession.Inflation is bad because prices rise and wages lag behind until workers can demand wages that meet their new needs, leading to a temporary decrease in the consumer confidence and their ability to save. This also benefits asset holders because their assets appreciate at or in excess of inflation, because earning increases temporarily outpace cost increases.Basically, if your way of living is based on owning the capital and land you benefit from virtually all economic trends short of a total economic collapse.

It also then becomes a debate about what is \\"acceptable suffering\\" where the objector needs to justify why their subjective standard should take priority.However if the objection is against the killing of animals in principle regardless of their suffering or lack thereof, then the objector needs to assert that the animals being alive is good in and of itself.

Everyone wants to assign blame because we're in shock and depressed.But I've realized, it's much simpler.Obama set things up so well that in spite of everything, for most people, the first few years of Trump, prior to COVID, were pretty good. Prices felt pretty low, mortgages were low, and we didn't have any major wars going on. COVID was almost certainly made worse by Trump, but it wasn't his direct fault.Similarly, the incredibly bad economic position that Trump left us with wasn't Biden's fault. Russia invading Ukraine? Not Biden's fault. Hamas slaughtering Israelis and starting a devastating war in the Middle East? Not Biden's fault. Despite a few missteps, Biden has handled some of the worst possible situations with aplomb. But what it doesn't change is how it feels to live in the US right now.I'm doing well for myself, but the last years under Biden have objectively been pretty bad. The actual job market is full of Ghost Jobs and highly volatile. I've only recently finally gotten a stable job. I got blindsided with my mortgage rate doubling between Trump's administration and Biden's as they desperately tried to control interest rates and I lost my original mortgage due to delays. *I* know that this is still better than the alternative. *I* still support Biden, Harris, and the DNC because the rough time I had under Biden is largely inherited from Trump and coupled with difficult global events.But there were people searching, on election day, whether Biden had dropped out. If people didn't know that, of course they don't know Harris's plans to help them, nor do they have the awareness to understand how badly Trump can hurt them. To a lot of people, it's simple. Things generally felt good under Trump, and things generally felt bad under Biden. So they vote for Trump again.

You don't.You can't be angry with a motherfucker for wanting some pie, pie is delicious. As tempting as it is to just be pissed, especially this week.If you want to convert people then promise them some pie. You want to turn them into allies, *give them some pie*. This is why Sanders was so popular, he said he had pie. Hillary told voters the pie was a lie, and they hated her.That's why they say it's the party of elitists. They view it as a party of people hoarding pie and demanding they educate themselves and vote for the greater good, but they can't have the pie. As far as social issues, people care about them a lot less while eating tasty tasty pie.Gotta go after the corporations if you want to change that perception.

Economic Policies\\t?\\tFocus on Jobs and the Economy: Many Latino voters are small business owners or work in industries where Trumps economic policies, such as tax cuts or deregulation, may have been seen as beneficial.\\n\\t?\\tLow Unemployment Rates: During Trumps first term, unemployment rates for Latino workers reached historic lows, which might have reinforced trust in his economic leadership.2. Cultural Conservatism\\t?\\tTraditional Values: Many Latino communities are socially conservative, aligning with Trumps positions on issues like religion, family values, and opposition to progressive policies such as those on gender identity or abortion.\\n\\t?\\tLaw and Order: Some voters may have supported Trumps stance on crime and border security, prioritizing safety and stability within their communities.3. Dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party\\t?\\tPerceived Disconnect: Some Latinos might feel that the Democratic Party takes their votes for granted or does not adequately address their specific concerns.\\n\\t?\\tEconomic Disillusionment: If Latino voters felt their financial situation did not improve under Democratic leadership, they may have turned to Trump as an alternative.4. Outreach Efforts\\t?\\tTargeted Campaigning: The Trump campaign has been active in reaching out to Latino voters in key states, emphasizing themes like economic opportunity, entrepreneurship, and patriotism.\\n\\t?\\tLocalized Messaging: Tailored messages addressing the unique needs of Cuban, Venezuelan, and other Latin American communities, particularly in Florida and Texas, may have resonated.5. Opposition to Progressive Policies\\t?\\tDislike of Woke Politics: Some Latino voters may oppose progressive or woke policies that they feel conflict with their cultural or economic interests.\\n\\t?\\tConcerns About Immigration Policies: While Trump is often seen as hardline on immigration, some Latino voters may support stricter border controls, viewing illegal immigration as detrimental to job security or community safety.6. Perception of Strong Leadership\\t?\\tCharismatic Appeal: Trumps strong, direct communication style may resonate with voters who prioritize decisive leadership.\\n\\t?\\tAnti-Establishment Appeal: Many voters, including Latinos, may support Trump as a way to push back against perceived political elites and systemic corruption.Latino voters are a diverse group, and their voting patterns can vary widely depending on factors like country of origin, socioeconomic status, and geographic location.","title":"Why Did Latinos Vote for Trump?"},{"text":"Anyone can be banned for any reason by volunteers with questionable intentions and no morals.

Kamala Harris did not run as \\"republican lite.\\" Stop using these general terms of propaganda already. However, Harris should have leaned more into most progressive policies. Many people who supported Harris were begging George W. Bush of all people to endorse her. What for? I thought it was acceptable that Liz Cheney would support Harris due to the unique circumstances and considering the fact that Harris did not give up a single policy to Cheney; but as more Republicans lined up, it gave legs to the absurd idea that 'the parties switched sides' or the notion of 'both sides same' which helped to sell fake 'outsider' Donald Trump just like happened in 2016.","title":"Democrats dreamt of an unbeatable coalition.

I grew up with conservative + religious family, friends, and community.I was a jock or meathead, but I read books and being smart was seen as something to aspire to by everyone in general. Thats no longer the case for American conservatism  today  this ideology doesnt value intelligence or expertise. It values the exercise and display of power, strength, etc, and idolizing these concepts. Despite everyone telling me to play college football, I went to a cheap, affordable community college. I continued to learn because I know educating myself is important. I learned about the history of the world and America in particular (focused on Civil War period during Masters).I have experienced many epiphanies throughout my life because I am open to new information and change. I had Conservative views growing up. My opinions and views about everything have changed many times and I hope I change more in the future.The problem is that this is easily doable for anyone with access to those resources I had, BUT they dont do it. They dont educate themselves because theyre simply lazy and shameless about it. No one can tell me its too much to expect from someone, because I did it and it wasnt even hard. Too many people simply seek out information that confirms what they already believe. They think thats doing research.They are not going to change their mind regardless of what people tell them. The only thing that can change their minds is personal experience. So, in order to get someone to do the research, they have to experience extreme discomfort or pain  enough to realize that their worldview is harmful to themselves. It needs to affect their survival in a direct way.Look, in the past people came up with all these political ideas and concepts to have their will represented in some form. They organized and overthrew shit. But the living conditions were BAD in the past. Things have never been better than the modern era globally (in general). People overthrew shit in the past because it was SO bad. Thats how it always happens.

Taking the election projected outcome exactly the way dictators and fascists need them to.A lot of you will call me delusional and say that I am on \\"copium\\". But what this actually is: I am a realist and a patient person who feels that upholding transparency and the truth always matters, whatever happens in the end.Anyone can factually verify that neither candidate has yet won, by looking at the vote counting map and thinking critically insread of emotionally. Neither candidate has won yet because votes are still being counted in several states where the margin between the two is small enough for it to go either way already as is, but especially because the currently announced votes being counted are \\"expected votes\\" which means there can legitimately be more to count before the end. Mischigan, in example, accepts absentee votes up to a week after election day. It is also possible that recounts need to happen for various reasons, which may or may not change things to either direction. Either way, recounts happen in all close elections and they are done to enforce legitimacy and security. Some of you will say this is not a close election but a landslide for Trump, but again, those who say that are ignoring the fact that votes are still being counted in states with razor-thin margins which can yet make this the closest election in history.It is exttemely important to care about transparency in the democratic process, and about fair and thorough vote counting taking time. And to be patient with waiting it to complete, instead of this automatic acceptance of a immediately projected winner before vote counting has ended and even regardless of how dead-heat close the margins are in remaining states. Parience, and respect for the value of every single vote cast, is totally missing in the post-election day discussions. Fascists and dictators are loving this--because they benefit from this kind of impatience and self-inflicted defeatism when vote counting is not even over yet, they benefit from massive emotional response and lack of critical thinking. So I don't mean just in this election but in all elections to come. Americans can't continue behaving this way about elections, especially if Trump wins.Close elections like this are not over until every single vote has been counted and certified which may not happen for a few more weeks in a large country. The media does not decide who wins, nor do Harris, Biden or Waltz, Trump, Vance or anyone else in advance. The votes that were cast decide it and this is why counting every single vote and doing everything proper to ensudre all went according to protocols and rules, before declairing a certain winner, matters. And right now, y'all completely ignoring this truth.Your mental health would be in a much better state if you were patient and wanted and looked for the truth instead of for a feeling of immediate certainty. I know it's been emotionally exhausting, scary and tough for ages but that's all the more reason to not fall victim to harmful cultural habits.Laywers, election workers and other officials are working hard to make sure this election just like all the ones before it is free and fair and secure. Media continues to fail you and current leaders are overly caurious at this critical time. So take your powerful voice and make it known loud and clear that everyobody's votes matter, a lot of them have not yet been counted, and that your desired outcome is legitimately still within reach. Also remember that one of the yet to be counted votes may be yours. Be proud of having cast it and defend its immense value.Trump may win. But he has not won yet. Harris may win. But she has not won yet. The election is not over and won't be for another few weeks because it's being conducted throroughly and being taken seriously by those tasked with protecting and ensuring its fairness and accuracy. And that, is a good thing when the stakes are this high.This message is important. Because IF Harris wins by the slimmest of margins, it must be after everyone has kept in mind that it was all along legitimately possible and that your democratic process can be trusted. This is also important because continuing to accept lack of transparency and continuing to prefer immediate results over paying attention to the real process, would lead to deeper troubles IF Trump wins. This message is important no matter who wins.","title":"CMV: American Democracy is Over"},{"text":"Also coordinated help lines to support or call -https://preview.redd.it/716l9v4xr40e1.jpeg?width=782&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93ded486689a5b222233328ae0ef4c4cfe21d906","title":"With Trump becoming president again, the below might not exist..."},{"text":"I also got a few \\"followers\\" after some comments agreeing with other right wingers, here and elsewhere.

I was the kid in class the lazy students would cheat off of, the kid who got stuck with all the work in group assignments. Until now it felt like I also had to be the one to put the time and actually deeply research issues while a certain demographic just gets to vote based on their gut. Since I cared about these people I would try to talk and have a conversation first, then I realized that words dont matter so it was up to me to talk and provide non biased sources. Now because of the breakdown in institutions no one believes facts from any source. The goal posts keep on moving. So then I was left with, just go and educate yourself with the idea that if they found the information on their own that they would actually believe it.Now, I just dont care and I feel like engaging just drives others farther away. I think liberals would be best served by minding their own business, stop protesting, stop making angry posts on the internet. Dont harrass congressmen to vote a certain way. Dont engage in any boycotting. Just let conservatives govern unhindered long enough for people to realize either everything is going to be okay and Trump is full of lies and isnt going to be any different than any other republican president or he is telling the truth and will follow through on some of his policies most economists (regardless of party) believe will make life much harder for the working class. Either way liberals win at the end, but not if they keep pushing away the very same people they need to show up at the polls. Lets face it, Dems suck at messaging and can only control a narrative for liberal audiences. An incumbent Trump is the only way to get liberals and independents to vote and conservatives to stay home.  Until liberals can find an economic populist of their own they need to take a step back, be neutral and get out of their own way.","title":"CMV: educate yourself is the intellectual version of pull yourself up by your bootstraps and is elitist"},{"text":"Trump didnt start the war with isis.
