Finally, both parties had to choose a second, a person who oversaw the duel and made sure everything was above board. The seconds would often work together to try and find a solution to prevent the duel from ever happening.  Your MAGA example makes me think this would be impossible. A right wing MAGA proud boy would most likely have a right wing MAGA proud boy second, and trying to get them to work peacefully with liberal anti-trumper seems impossible.

The media was far too eager to hold him to a standard they wouldn't hold Trump to. We all should remember Trump's meandering speeches in rallies, needing two hands to lift a glass, etc. I've been pretty convinced that Biden was a strong if imperfect President, and that if his job is to run the country by appointing a cabinet of competent experts instead of look good on TV, he has always been a better candidate than Trump.In fact, as long as the narrative was \\"someone else should run,\\" I wanted him to stay in the race. Democrats and the media to speak for them shot themselves in the foot running the imaginary candidate that only existed in their minds because they couldn't handle a real flesh-and-blood person running against Trump and Putin's disinformation machine. It was only when the Democrats said they wanted Kamala specifically that I got on board, *and Biden agreed to step aside*.To now turn around and say he could have won is the worst of sour grapes. It was his job to do whatever it took to uphold the democracy. If him staying in the race would have done that, then it was his job to *show us that*.I'm pretty confident history is going to regard Biden well, but whining now about what could have been when he had the power to make it so is a good way to sabotage it.","title":"Biden Exits Battling for His Legacy and Believing He Could Have Won"},{"text":"I think not and you can already see a huge cooling down in the media.

My CV showcased my github projects. During my interviews I was given some very basic leetcode style questions and drilled on my projects, what I did, and why I did what I did. I think from scratch, you can teach yourself to program fairly well at a junior level and you can probably put together a portfolio that is actually quite impressive within a compressed timeline (~12 to 18 months) if you really work at it.If this is a path you want to pursue, you should come up with a bit of a plan as to what you want to do and where you want to go. Personally, I would suggest something like:1. **A low-level starter**: Any kind of course where you're learning to program with C. This lets you start with a language that much more close to your computer's hardware with less stuff that's abstracted away from you (I recommend CS50x which is free and extremely fun, the course tutor is an extremely skilled orator and will get you interested in programming if you're not already).2. **Some kind of python / javascript basics course**: You want some familiarity with a fairly straight-forward higher level language that allows you to complete leetcode-style tasks.3. **Data Structures &amp; Algorithm fundamentals course**: Basically, a course that familiarizes you with the kinds of patterns seen in leetcode-style problems. These patterns show up *all the time* in any kind of developer work, they're important to become familiar with.4. **Optional: Object-Oriented Programming / Functional Programming course**: Personally, I didn't learn any of this until I was already working as a junior dev, but I wish I had because it would have led to way less headaches starting out.5. **Full-stack webdev bootcamp course**: You want something that teaches you modern web technology fundamentals (CSS + HTML + Front-end framework + Back-end framework + database + git). You don't have to have expert knowledge in everything, but at least rough knowledge where you're able to connect the pieces together.6. **Work through a very large scale capstone project**: You want a project that isn't just a re-hashed tutorial course project or todo list. It should be something that lets you connect a database + a web server + a frontend that is live on the web, and is something that is at least reasonably meaningful (\\"I had a X problem and I solved it with my Y project\\")I think having great projects that are serious enough can actually make your CV stand out without a degree or career experience. And that will at least put you on par with a cs grad. The only caveat I would say is that the tech market right now isn't great for anyone, and this is less to do with AI than it is to with interest rates and a glut of cs grads entering the market. The tech market is very cyclical. If you're unable to get hired despite trying your best, it may be that you may just need to wait a bit for the market to recover, which I'm positive it will.Oh, and if you have questions or just want general advice, you're always welcome to dm me. :)","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"LeVey has nothing to do with TST.

I'm a **gigantic** Biden stan, but he really should've dropped out instead of running again.

Biden absolutely killed it legislatively, but there's only so much he can do. There's no reversing inflation, only getting it back under control so it doesn't run away. Prices were never, and are never, gonna go back down to what they used to be. But most people just feel the hurt in their wallets, and blame the guy in charge.I dunno, I love Biden. I think he's one of the greatest modern Presidents. I'm absolutely floored by what he accomplished, even with what was barely a majority in the Senate. But staying in was a mistake with a sky high cost. I'm trying to stay as optimistic as possible, but we might be fucked.

(I wish this was the top upvoted comment instead of the other \\"Ukraine 2.0\\" comments.)**\\nTo address?\\"Firstly - If this is such a massive resource why would Denmark ever accept the US's offer? Surely its worth far more to Denmark for the exact same reasons.\\"\\n(1A) Denmark's GDP is 400 billion. It would take hundreds of billions of dollars to develop Greenland into a multi-trillion dollar trade/mineral economy.\\n(1B) Without mineral extraction **(which Danes would never do)** Greenland is not worth multi-Trillion, and thus not worth hundreds of billions to invest even if they had the money to expend like USA does.\\nAdditional In-Depth Explaination of costs: Poland's world-class airport they plan to build costs $9 billion and Singapore's chokepoint Mega-Port with Smart A.I capabilities costed 10-20 billion, thats just 2 things. If Greenland (only has 90 mile road network) wants world-class infrastructure, it would take LOTS of money that a 400 Billion GDP **simply cannot give unlike the USA.**\\"Secondly - What of the native Greenlanders? Do they not get a say? Under Denmark they have not been treated perticularly well... USA hasn't either.. up to Greeland whether they stay with Denmark, become independant or join another country like the US or Canada? (paraphrased)\\"\\n**Disclaimer:** Before I type out the addressing this, I disagree with Trump on this. He should ABSOLUTELY be trying to negotiate with Greenland, and NOT Denmark. (The post was about Greenland being essential to America, my agreement with Trump's GOAL of American Greenland*, not the immoral land-purchase method that Trump is currently using).\\n**(2A-Sovereignty):** America, while morally reprehensible, can legally buy Greenland from Denmark since Greenland is not a sovereign country. They are owned by Denmark with domestic autonomy.\\n**(2B-Natives):** America does have a bad track record, yes, but they could easily do concessions and legal guarantees that America would listen to the Natives concerns and wouldn't mistreat them.**(2C-Sovereignty):** I agree with you that Greenlanders should decide for themselves. **67% of Greenland wants to leave Denmark at some point to become independent.** Greenland would have the most benefits in joining America and America is the realistic path if Greenland ever became independent. (Not sustainable economically/Canada wouldn't accept them to not piss off America/Poland or other EU allies would blocked Greenland being in the EU).\\n\\"Thirdly - .... Extracting resources from the land... Greenlanders should be the ones who get to have a say.... Environmental consequences of extraction... Do we (as a globe) really want the pole's resources to be extracted for the sake of capital investment by the rich of America?\\"\\n**(3A-Extraction)** China has Muslim concentration camps and Russia is commiting genocide in Ukraine. I care more about beating them than environmental concerns. Human Life  Environment (my POV).?Mineral Extraction would be very beneficial to NATO as it completely destroys any reliance on Russia's mineral reserve advantage and China's 95% rare earth mineral monopoly. To let China/Russia move towards global supremacy is farrrrr more immoral than an environment deteriorating.\\n**(3B-Mineral exploits)** I agree that its *moral* to let Greenland decide whether to exploit its own resources but if America purchases the land from Denmark (also immoral) then America's right to. **Granted, I PERSONALLY want Greenland to VOTE to join America under some pro-environmental concessions from Trump so that the Native Inuit decide.**\\n**(3C-Does the world want this?)** Russia will be using the Arctic's minerals, so America has to keep up to not get beaten. Its not non-imortant feelings/ideals at stake here, its the lives of 330 million people in American Civilization if we ever come to a conflict. The USA should be prepared to GO TO war at any time so the CHANCES of war go down. \\"Best way to avoid war is to make it an unappealing option/prepare for it.\\"** For \\"if the globe wants it or not\\", why should it matter if they do or not? Nations always act in their 1st interest as principle and America is not some Nazi civilization, its a civilization that gives 50% of Global food aid, beat the Japanese empire, sent a man on the moon, and are working on putting a man on Mars. America, with its flaws, is the greatest civilization on earth for what it contributed to mankind/humanity.\\n---\\n\\"Its selfish/insensitive\\" (last paragraph of your comment)Geopolitics is inherently selfish and feelings dont matter when people's lives/wellbeing are on the line. Every country acts in accordance to its own self-intrests. To say \\"something is selfish therefore wrong\\" is a principle that could be applied to all countries when they want something limited\\nIs Iceland selfish for its fishing claims because it benefits them? Is this small country now bad?\\nSee how that principle can be applied??\\n**I personally belive that people/population should be of the highest Virtue and morality but governments make decisions with the weight on millions of lives that don't take into account feelings. Feelings don't matter in trade deals or military alliances. America is not benefitial allies with Saudi Arabia and Israel in the conflict-ridden middle east because of feelings but BECAUSE of mutual national interests with complex cutthroat undertones. At the end of the day, thats what matters for a successful/most peaceful ordering of the world**\\nEnd of commentI know this was a long comment of difference of ideals but I'm glad I go to explain myself and respond to your points! I really enjoyed doing so.\\nAgain.

Was 23 when moved to NYC. Never felt as unsafe as I have the past approx 2 years. I've had a huge loogie hucked in my face. Ive been harassed on the subway multiple times. When I first  moved there it was what I call normal city unsafe- like every city has crime but it's mostly avoidable if you are alert and aware of your surroundings. In the past 2 years I have been chase down the road 3 times, assaulted with a shopping cart by a homeless person, a guy tried to punch me in the face but luckily I wasn't on my phone and dodged it, 1 of my friends got followed into her apartment and the guy was in her hallway. My boyfriend and I moved out in August but there were people shooting up on our doorstep in broad daylight circa 4 pm. Bunch of needles and tools laid out on the doorstep. Also on our street someone stole a truck and was driving it 60 mph the wrong way up a 1 way and smashed a bunch of cars on our block and the cops had to shoot out the windows and drag the people out of the truck.  The apartment right next to mine was broken into by illegals and when my neighbors came home they had to call the cops and had destruction done to their apartment. Oh and I lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan which USED to be boujee and safe. Now it's just a third world country. Go to the instagram page \\"@uppereastsiteny\\" and go to the month of August. There were at least 15 assaults in just August alone. And that's just ONE neighborhood in ONE borough. And scroll back further than August if you want to, and again just think on a grand scale that's just the REPORTED crimes in one month in 1 month in 1 neighborhood. I never reported any of my incidents and I know most people don't so multiply the news articles by like a thousand. If anything the news is not reporting the crime in NYC ENOUGH. They're trying to hide how dangerous it is. I would also never wear makeup or do my hair and wear baggy clothes-i would try to make myself as unattractive as possible (which shouldn't be a thing, i should feel safe to dress how i want) but anyhoo i looked like shit and would still get chased after so I can't even imagine how often all the influencers don't feel safe in NYC.  Eh but I guess they're rich and have money for car service everywhere so maybe they're fine actually. Idk but for the average joe that takes the subway to work, especially women, feel very unsafe. I'm white, 5'4 , 135 lbs, very average looking prob a 7-7.5, 5 with no makeup lol. Just to paint a picture at how I feel/ what I witness. I don't see many dudes being harassed but I see women of every race being harassed and speaking of how unsafe they feel 24/7. I was also in the hospital last week and lots of illegals in there making women feel unsafe, going up to them and trying to talk to their babies and they ran to security but security hardly even addressed the issue. Oh and I've been in 2 pharmacies while they were being robbed. Oh and lots of nudity,  lots of bums jerking off in broad daylight in the park. Idk how anybody could start a family there, it madness. Oh and the bar I used to work at had a serial rapist that would r*pe women and then he would be back on the street the next day. Catch &amp; release in NYC has the cops just picking people up when they commit a crime and putting them back on the street the next day. Also a bar down the street from me was held up and robbed and tied all the employees up it was either last year or the year before. And it's never reported in the news. Again, they are UNDER reporting crimes by a LOT I promise you. I am 1 person of approx 9 million people.

There are aspects of your view I agree on and I'll focus on what I disagree with. Mainly, the core of that is found in these two parts of your view (and my concerns are listed with them):1). \\n Before I start, Im gonna make it clear. There are certain styles of parenting that absolutely should be condemned, whether it is neglectful parenting where the kids basically have to raise themselves, or extremely strict parenting where the kid lives in constant fear of punishment, or the whole kids first bully type thing. These are both examples of child abuse. With that being said, I dont think it is right to shame parents for parenting their children in a way that you wouldnt parent your own child. I personally dont have any children, but I can see how hard a parents job can be. Its exhausting, and the majority of parents are doing what they believe is best for their children.Here's the issue. As I, along with other estranged people know, parents are capable of convincing themselves that some *wild* shit is the best for their child or children. Things that to you, I, and everyone else **is abuse**. Emotional abuse, physical abuse, subtle abuse, obvious abuse...So, this whole *we should trust that a parent always has their child's best interest at heart* thing is flawed. It doesn't acknowledge the fact that a parent can think they're doing what is best, that their actions will help their child, etc, etc, **and** those actions be child abuse.My point being here is that saying we shouldn't shame parents because we should instead trust that they're trying their best is flawed logic. To be more blunt, it's this kind of logic that made people turn a blind eye to the abuse that happened during my childhood. It's the attitude held in the SE United States by southern people of a certain cultural subset. It's not their place to comment on the way parents raise their children-even if that involves abuse-*and so they don't*.\\n2). - **There is more than one way to raise a child:** Look, we can sit here and talk about research for the best parenting styles, and while that information may be useful to draw from, every child is different and their parents know them best. My parents had to raise my brother and I in different ways due to our differing personalities, and ultimately parents just have to do what they think is right.There is. But, as you stated yourself, there are certain parenting styles that are undeniably lesser because they do irreparable harm (see, child abuse). And there's a certain point where whether or not a technique technically works *does not matter due to the harm it does*.Example; If you have a sensitive child and you toughen them up through yelling, etc, etc, and it seems to work..You really just made your child *so afraid* of expressing emotions that they instead learned to repress them. Sure, you technically achieved your end goal of your child no longer throwing emotional tantrums **but it came at the cost of great harm to their psyche and how they process emotions**.Here's my main complaint with your entire post. So much of what I see you saying basically boils down to \\"parenting is hard and we shouldn't judge people for doing their best\\".  We should instead, as you suggest, assume they're trying their best.In theory, that's nice. And in theory, I agree. We shouldn't criticize people for doing their best.In reality, assuming everyone is doing their best often means ignoring signs of abuse. Because if you have to assume they're doing their best and you should not criticize them unless the signs of abuse are **bat signal blatant**, you miss so many of the more subtle signs of abuse. Worse, it sometimes makes you complicit because you *make excuses* for the parents and their actions.

But notice...I don't speak offensively about ANYBODY because that's against the rules!  Plus, Jesus wants us to WHAT boys and girls?\\n LOVE THE SINNER, HATE THE SIN.Just saying the WORD \\"hate,\\" is almost illegal.  This new norm of the freak parade being totally embraced and entitled to special treatment and protection, is just THAT ~ the new reality!My point is, and yes, I have one...is that like Don Quixote, you're trying to fight windmills!  In the words of Dr. Phil, \\"How's that workin for ya?\\". Nothing You say or do, will change this new and perverse reality.  Don't give it anymore of your energy!Pray with me...God grant me the SERENITY to accept the things I cannot change,\\nCOURAGE to change the things I can,\\nand the WISDOM to know the difference.  \\nAmen","title":"Reddit will never be great again."},{"text":"You've laid out a case for why it would be to the USA's benefit to get control of Greenland.

Let me explain:The moment we try to buy Greenland, we'd instantly validate China's territorial expansion tactics in the South China Sea and Russia's in the Arctic. We'd lose all moral high ground in international diplomacy. As a centrist, you must see how this would destroy our ability to challenge their aggressive policies.The rare earth minerals angle? That's actually counterproductive. Right now, we're making huge progress in rare earth processing right here in the US - MP Materials in California is already processing them, and we're building more facilities in Texas. Buying Greenland would cost us hundreds of billions while these domestic solutions are already working.Plus, you're overlooking the massive environmental damage we'd cause by extracting those resources. The melting ice sheets there are already a climate tipping point. Drilling for oil and mining would accelerate that process, flooding coastal cities worldwide. The \\"unlimited concrete\\" from glacier sand would mean destroying ancient ice formations. That's not the kind of legacy we want.Also, Denmark and the EU would never allow it. They've already shot down the idea multiple times. Pushing for it would damage our NATO relationships when we need them most against Russia and China.Instead of trying to buy territory like it's the 1800s, we should focus on strengthening our Arctic partnerships and investing in our own resource independence.

Is there a link between increasing productivity and credit/money supply.Or are you broadly saying that increased productivity probably wont cause deflation?Also I take your point about TVs and static demand, but you can also use this as an example of how demand can respond a lot to decreasing prices. The average household now has closer to three tv sets, and that isn't including how pervasive screens have become elsewhere (cars, screens, vending machines. My local petrol station has TVs showing ads above each bowser). And of course, as soon as TVs due to technology dropped below a certain price point they became affordable throughout the developing world which shot up demand by billions).

At the ballot box and in the streets, these diverse activists demanded not only integration but economic justice, labor rights, and real political power for all.

If an industry is highly profitable, more individuals will attempt to enter the industry. This creates an increase in supply which causes a drop in prices as each individual and their company attempts to maintain market share and revenue. Eventually enough individuals enter an industry that the average profit margin reaches zero and individuals leave the industry to find other opportunities.With the example of TVs that everyone likes using, the supply of TVs went up (due to improvements in flat screen technology) but demand stayed about the same (you really only need 1 TV) so companies had to reduce prices in order to compete for the limited market. Inefficient companies that have per unit costs that are higher than the price of a TV would (and will ) exit the TV market. Because the TV market is a rather small part of the economy, it does not have much of an impact on inflation. Most deflation events that I have read about tend to come around as a result of credit and money supply. When consumers and investors have no more money to spend and have maxed out their credit sources, they cut spending which has rippling effects.","title":"Out of curiosity, does r/neoliberal believe that a deflationary sprial can be created from production and distribution becoming too efficient?

And Ive sat at the edge of every peace deal offering statehood to the Palestinians only to see their leadership choose war and sacrificing their young again and again.Can you imagine my shock when I saw them choose suicide bombings and terrorist stabbings of civilians (a Holocaust survivor grandmother was just killed by a West Bank terrorist last week)Thats when I remembered the walls coming up around Gaza and my mindset shifting.Thats when I learned that it was Hamas that put Palestinians in harms way and record them dying to use for propaganda and aid resources which they stole.I then learned how the leaders of Hamas from Qatar were worth billions upon billions and used this money that they stole to fund more terror.Simply put Im pro two state solution but until Irans terrorist regime collapses and Hamas is destroyed there will be no possibility.I see today children dressing like Hamas while proclaiming they are pro Palestine.

Before the Jews could grieve? On 10/8?It was discovered that those Gazans provided intel and passageways to Hamas to kill the same families that welcomed them into their homes.So when they say are you pro 2 state solution what does that mean?

The increase in demand for goods will cause the prices to stop deflating and go up thus ending the spiral.3.) Massive government spending, like the TVA project will create new jobs and put money in the hands of people who will then spend it on goods stimulating demand.

The worst has happened to many civilizations in the past and it only has to happen once for the damage to be irreparable. . .so betting the worst won't happen is great until it does and it really doesn't do anything for accountability in political discourse because it then just means only the most sure headed (not the most knowledgable) people partake.It's the same problem with polling right now.

On the programmer side, to work in the best companies like Amazon and cool startups you need to be in person in office in US. (If its US based which they all are haha).The reality is that satellite offices are less effective than home base offices due to information transfer/collaboration/trust.

It helped him win but it also set many expectations that simply are not going to be met. Most of his horrid plans will not get off the ground. The ones that do will be awful, but will only end up hurting him and the gop. These plans aren't going to help prices, they aren't going to bring calm.  They are going to do nothing to change the norm that many that voted for him are so frustrated with.  It's the main reason why he's already trying to back track on his nonsensical promises. Lets also not forget that Trump, his maga loyalists and many of the GOP are: 1. Incompetent.  2. Have massive fragile egos.  3. And have the mental maturity of a toddler. These people will spend more time infighting with each other than spending time to actually get their horrid plans off the ground. Especially so given their extremely thin majority in the house. We can take advantage of all of this, using it to give us more success in elections going forward. We have a lot to learn from the presidential result but future success is closer than we think.  Many online rhetoric outside here make it seem that it was a landside, and a complete rejection of the party.  Yet GOP could only win one out of five swing state senate races and lost seats in the house in an anti incumbency climate.It's also important not to lose sight of recent past successes.  Before this, since 2016 the gop had loss after loss.  2022 being a big one.  A big under performance in a Biden mid term where inflation was very high.  Gop barely taking the house and Dems gaining a senate seat.  Plus many successes for us on the state executive and legislative level. There is a very solid foundation to build on, that has held strong in even the worst climates.  Excited to see what we can do in more favorable ones going forward. And another thing! There are so many great people in the party, those here, those elsewhere behind the scenes in the party, and so many great candidates going forward.  In sports terms, the bench is stacked!  A big advantage we have over the opposition.  A party that nominates folks like Mark Robinson, Kari Lake, Royce White, Mastriano and so on, and so on... To close things aren't going to be easy these next four years that is for sure.  There will be dark days, but it's all the reason to focus on the light.  And there is so much of it even at times there doesn't seem to be.  In others, and most importantly in ourselves.  Things can get better and have.  Humanity would of never gotten this far if that wasn't true. Be kind to yourself, take breaks when you need to, and work to create even more good!

And while she lost, it still was ultimately a MOE race where the story is arguably more why did much of Bidens 2020 coalition stay home? Because to that pointwhile she lost, Harris still got more votes than every Democratic presidential nominee other than Biden.Edit: for further context, had there been just a 1% shift in Harris favor, she wouldve not only won the NPV but also wouldve won the presidency. Trump won the three Rust Belt swing states (PA, MI, and WI) by a roughly 1% margin each (less than that in MI and WI).

But 15 months into the war in the Middle East, as the GOP trifecta prepares to control the White House and Congress, leaders in the movement find themselves with far less leverage  and much more to lose.The Palestinian rights movement is very clear eyed in understanding that it is very likely that this Trump administration will mean that things get much worse for Palestinians, said Beth Miller, the political director for Jewish Voice for Peace Action, a left-wing advocacy organization.\\nThis administration will likely be coming very quickly to try to take down the Palestinian rights movement, she added.Support for Israel is largely bipartisan, but Republicans have led the charge in criticizing the broader pro-Palestinian movement. A Republican-led House panel has sunk three Ivy League presidents over allegations of antisemitism around pro-Palestinian protests on their campuses. And last month, the House passed a bill that jeopardizes the tax-exempt status of any group the Treasury secretary deems a terrorist supporting organization, which movement leaders fear will chill pro-Palestinian speech.Palestine is, in many ways, the canary in the coal mine, said Sandra Tamari, the executive director of Adalah Justice Project. And so our organizations are under more threats, because what all those authoritarian forces would love to do is to shut down any dissent in the country.A spokesperson for Trumps transition did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump himself is a staunch ally of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and has a number of pro-Israel backers, including megadonor Miriam Adelson, an Israeli billionaire on whom Trump bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2018. During his 2024 campaign, Trump called Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish, a proud member of Hamas because he refused to shake the Israeli prime ministers hand.Im pretty sure you will see real concern around legislative efforts to silence speech, to control demonstrations and actions of that sort, said James Zogby, the founder of the Arab American Institute and Democratic National Committee veteran currently running to be its vice chair. We dont know how off the rails Trump will go with acceding to Netanyahus plans.From the onset of the war, pro-Palestinian groups across the U.S. hit Democrats hard.

To start with an on-topic one, beating lots of Republicans.  Obviously this isn't a game, and every election makes a difference to peoples' rights.  But from an election standpoint, 2017-2018 was *fun*.  Anyone who was around then remembers that stretch where every Tuesday, we were flipping another district Trump won by 10 points.  The big-time races like Doug Jones and Conor Lamb's victories were awesome, but beating back the GOP in random state house districts across the country was a weekly shot of hope and joy.  I can't wait for that to get going again.2. In my own life, finally figuring out what my brain means to me.  Two years ago I found out that I'd been diagnosed with autism as a kid and never told (parents, don't do this).  This past summer, I found out that I likely have ADHD as well.  I've spent a lot of time figuring out how that's explained my place in the world, and why I've struggled with some things but found happiness in others.  Throwing aside 'normal' standards of what my life should look like and being my weird self, and learning to ignore what others think, is a big part of what I want to do this year.  Sometimes it hurts to realize how anti-neurodivergent society is.  But I'm excited to push back.3. Watching Josh Allen do magic every week.  I know, sports, but in the long history of the Buffalo Bills, there have been two times it hasn't absolutely sucked to be a Bills fan.  The Jim Kelly run in the late '80s and '90s, and literally right now.  Maybe this year will finally be the year, but even if it's not, I'm enjoying the ride.","title":"A New Year's message from the mod team (and Daily Discussion Thread for January 1st, 2025)"},{"text":"I've been summoned, ahah!?

Instead, a la Neil postmans entertaining ourselves to death, our news sources have turned to entertainment and inaccurate information in order to manipulate. With repetition of consumption of news, in this largely devoid of critical thinking fashion, viewers will recall memories from that environment, that show, and ignore critical evidence based thinking.Ask a car mechanic friend who identifies as republican, a vehicle related issue and they will blow you away with their knowledge, calling on memories from prior repairs and utilizing critical thinking. Now ask that same person a political question, one with evidence that shakes their current belief, and they arent as likely to utilize that critical thinking they expressed with the car question with repair memories, instead they call upon memories from their news show, devoid of critical thinking. People heavily identifying with groups like MAGA, they can feel disassociation, loss of identity, symptoms similar to leaving a community web, when they learn their group may be harming them, and struggle to really internalize that evidence backed response regarding politics.With the fairness doctrine repealed (deregulated news), taxes reduced (resource/wealth imbalance across our socioeconomic spectrum, and citizens united (enabling money from wealthy and corporations to corrupt politics), we face a divided nation, done so slowly overtime, like a frog in a boiling pot.

Americans have clearly demonstrated that they literally will not stop spending money so I think we're pretty far from that. As long as the demand continues to grow alongside supply it'll be fine. It's now abundantly clear that we have hinged our economic wellbeing on collective demand, because our main tools since 2008 have been fiscal stimulus and a never-ending well of demand to keep liquidity high. I think the real issue is if aggregate consumption somehow massively falters years down the line. Right now, I think that the service sector isn't so integral that monetary policy can't address it. I really don't like the current setup of gig work, primarily for non-economic reasons (I think that having a class of what are essentially fast-food/taxi servants is probably damaging to the collective psyche), but as they grow we will necessarily need consumption to remain high to avert that class suddenly losing a lot of work. If they do, in response to a major downturn in consumption, I think service workers failing in their financial situation will unfurl across the entire economy as consumption is further hampered.","title":"Out of curiosity, does r/neoliberal believe that a deflationary sprial can be created from production and distribution becoming too efficient?

Trump opposed full abortion bans and came out for a 12-week ban. He was asked how his evangelical base would react to it and he said \\"well they still have to vote for me, what are they going to do elect a Democrat who will push for abortions up to birth\\"? And he was right, evangelicals and super pro life people continued to support him. But when it comes to the far left, they don't do the same. When one candidate is pushing for a progressive tax system and raising taxes on people making 400k+ but not dismantling capitalism while the other candidate is pushing for tax cuts for the rich and corporations, your response isn't \\"guess I have to vote for the one more in line with my views\\", it's \\"earn my vote and cater to me\\".

When they calculate the cost to house inmates, some leave off the actual cost of lifelong medical care for life inmates who have serious illnesses. The cost to house elderly inmates is dramatically increased compared to a 20 year old inmate. When you combine the cost of surgery and lifetime elderly care it far outweighs the cost of the death penalty.The process of the death penalty is needlessly prolonged because of lawyers as opposed to the actual process itself.

You know from experience that whatever made the noise could be a threat, and since you don't know if the noise was caused by an actual threat or maybe the wind just knocked something over, it's safer to remain alert until you can confirm, so your body keeps you in a state of being alert until you can confirm.  You're assigning agency and intent to a possible threat that could very well just be the wind.  Now, imagine you can't confirm if it was the wind or an actual threat.

Truman at the very least was at least as pro-labor as Biden is. Eisenhower passed the Federal Aid Highway Act and was the one who had first commissioned a study into how to get it done. Truman, Eisenhower, JFK, and LBJ at the very least were all constantly passing education funding and listening to teachers and their unions about what they wanted. Heck Carter created the federal Department of Education, something that teachers had been asking for since *1867* at the very latest after Eisenhower had gone halfway there and made it a co-department with Health and Welfare. Nixon passed the Clean Air act and founded the EPA which taken in the context of his time was a pretty big step.And on top of all of that you're forgetting a few key issues that people care about 1) foreign affairs, biden was weak here compared to progressive desires refusing to even pay lip service to the idea that Israel's war of destruction and genocide could be wrong, 2) racial justice, biden did actually try here, he was doing his best to move the needle in the right direction but was held back by congress, 3) keeping your promises, biden came in with *very* lofty promises, he promised 2k to everyone, delivered only 1.4k, he promised student debt forgiveness but was blocked at every turn (and many believe there were smarter, easier, harder to block ways he could've gone about it), he promised a grand infrastructure bill, and got less than half of what he promised, he promised a resurgence of union protections and then didn't get the bill passed and had his administration convince unions to back down, 4) covid, Biden didn't really do anything extra to stop covid and indeed declared the pandemic as \\"over\\" when it still rages to this very day and is still killing and disabling so many people every day.","title":"CMV: I don't think much progressive change will come to America nor the Democratic party in the future."},{"text":"You're right that now *is* the time, just look at how much support Luigi Mangione has gotten from the right and the left.

Before she told us about her trips, I had taken her to a Dr. because I was a little worried about how much my daughter talked to and about Ena. The Dr told us it was normal and to just play along and she would grow out of it. A few months later, we were on a plane. She was looking out the window when she started to crack up. I asked her what she was laughing at and she told me to look out the window because Ena was flying outside of the plane. She then said Look Mom! All of Enas friends are flying too! Thats so silly, they should be in the plane! At that moment I was shocked. I verified with her that she was setting more beings then just Ena and I also had to be honest with her and tell her that only she could see Ena. After that experience, I was talking to my mom who suggested that maybe Ena was an angel. I was not religious and totally didnt believe anything about it. So one day, as I am brushing my daughters hair, I asked her if Ena knew who Jesus was. She turned around so fast and said Yeah! Ena knows Jesus. He came here to save the world. They put him on the wood with the big screw drivers. Everyone was there to see it. At this point my logical brain is thinking somebody told my child about this. I question her on who told her about Jesus. She told me no one told her about it cause she saw it herself. I asked her how that was possible and thats when she described her brain leaving her body sometimes and Ena taking her to Jesus world. I did ask her to tell me what she saw at the crucifixion. She was standing in the back where all the women were standing. The people who put him on the wood were wearing bug costumes (pleated leather ?), she said that there was so much blood that you couldnt tell he was a man. I asked her if she was scared of what she saw and she flat out tells me No it was good. She then described how Jesus took his last breath and the Earth started to shake very bad. Everyone started to run away. She even described seeing people put Jesus body in a cave where he got up 3 days later. After that experience, she would randomly tell us what she saw or what Ena would tell her. She saw future events too (a time where she saw herself watching an analog TV, possibly a future without internet) and she also described witnessing the rapture. Shes 17 now and remembers most of it.

So much of what we are shown to be Christianity today has absolutely nothing to do with what Christ actually taught. If Jesus walked into most Churches today, most Christians wouldnt know who he was. Many would probably eject him from the congregation for not dressing appropriately or actually questioning what the priest is parroting from a grossly mistranslated book.

Women take a significant risk of injury in every birth that is completely uncompensated (about 6% chance of injury that would take month or more to recover, more than US army casualty rate in Grenada).

A homo economicus as envisioned by Adam Smith would never take this deal. As more people are guided by only economical stimula, less women agree to this unfair deal. There it is. A government that wants children is going to have to pay a lot more for the labor of people who raise them. Or it can ban abortions and see birth rate go up that way.

If you get to the understanding of outside consciousness (true or not) then these would be ways, either by choice or not, that access higher consciousness and/or summon beings...demons is one understanding.The gnostic book provides a nice outline of a Christian document that digs deeper into bloodlines and who had what role and power.  You can also read many other religious texts to overlay with this.

Efforts to streamline requirements are ongoing, but the system for evaluating environmental and historic preservation aspects of projects is not expected to be available for another six to eight months1.\\n3. **Technology Deployment**: There have been discussions about the best technologies to use, with some preferring fiber-based broadband and others advocating for alternatives like licensed fixed wireless and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. This has led to differing opinions on how to approach various alternatives1.\\n4. **Workforce Shortages**: The demand for skilled labor to expand broadband infrastructure across all states and territories has outstripped supply, leading to workforce shortages.\\n5. **Funding Distribution and Implementation**: The significant delay between the enactment of the legislation and the commencement of funding distribution has raised concerns about the timely deployment of broadband infrastructure.

No exaggeration there. The guests on KT are really what I care about the most at this point. Btw, the episode from last week had comedian Kyle Dunnigan doing his [RFK Jr](https://youtu.be/WaHG8fXDt3M?si=wiCxCn3Sq8afx5ZV) impression as a guest and it was absolutely hilarious. Highly recommend that episode along with the Trump (Shane Gillis) and Biden (Adam Ray) [episodes](https://youtu.be/ZgHR4ug866Q?si=RShgJ2cjqlifqO7E ). Shanes Trump is literally the best Trump impression by a mile, and Adam Ray does a fantastic Biden as well. But yeah, those sub mods fucking suck lol. Oh, and I got immediately banned from r/ pics simply because I have commented on this sub and some other Trump sub as well lol.

It's not like it's remotely difficult to find hundreds, if not thousands of organizations, institutions, groups and efforts that have dedicated all their efforts and finances to combat and reverse climate change, end wars, fight autocracy, resolve conflicts, relieve hunger, end illiteracy and diseases and a thousand other things that are making the world better. Then you could have the satisfaction of knowing you're actually doing something to help humanity. But, if you'd rather complain and rant and throw shit everywhere rather than do something about it, you'll definitely have plenty of other miserable people for company. It's much easier to complain about how broken everything is than to try and fix it after all.\\nHere's a very small sampling of all the resources and organizations you could join or contribute to that work to stop climate change and help those affected by it, and strengthen and expand conservation. They also work to end the spread of autocracy, war and conflict, and work for human rights. And all of them operate worldwide for climate action, human rights, and peacebuilding.

I was asked why I didn't take care of her and had to tell them I do everything I can, she has a walker, she has the thing that lets her do [her thing on the bed](https://i.imgur.com/nljCMsr.png) but she refused to even wear diapers (which she also had for free from her health plan), she also refused to let my brother or sister or her grandkids to come over and stay with her to help her, she was very active, liked to cook, I bought her lighter knives and things to help her with cooking because she'd bruise her hands. She was talking on the phone and tried to put it on the shelf on top of the kitchen, I don't know how but it bounced or something and hit her under the eye and left her just like in the picture here, when I arrived home she was like \\"meh, shit happens don't worry\\".

Well it wasn't. Perhaps you forgot the ever so slightly important contribution of voters. You're just gonna let them off the hook as if they bear no responsibility? Because they bear the *final* responsibility. And it's bullshit to treat them as helpless victims. There's never been another election where the electorate had access to as much information as this one. Information as to who exactly was telling the truth and who actually worked for their benefit.Should representatives make their case to voters? Of course they should. But voters have the final responsibility to be well informed, and they've failed. Repeatedly. No one wants to admit or accept that fact because our culture only cares about blaming someone else. No one is interested in taking responsibility for their own actions. Hell, it's *the* defining characteristic of MAGA. Grievance is their north star.But so-called swing voters and independents do it now too. We hear it in their bullshit excuses that this or that candidate didn't \\"speak to me\\", or they never visited my particular town to \\"win\\" my vote. These are lame excuses to avoid responsibility and I think everyone knows that, if they're being honest with themselves.In my own family and many others there's siblings under the same roof where one went for Trump and the other Harris. Both had the same access to information as the other. But one chose to educate themselves on who was telling the truth and who was lying. Who actually had a record of helping people like them and who made promises they never kept. And the other chose the lazy way out and voted *against* anyone that made them feel guilty or *for* anyone who made them feel ok about being assholes or jerks.Voters made this happen, and no one forced them or duped them into voting the way they did. So stop treating them like victims or innocent bystanders. We have Trump because more voters either liked him, or hated Harris than the reverse.We're in this situation largely because the newsmedia has coddled voters for decades and treated them as if they were untouchable. Never to be criticized or in any way held to account for their votes. So rather than having a well informed electorate, we have generations of voters that feel no need to educate themselves. That feel entitled to demand candidates kiss their asses and suck up to them. And if they feel in any way taken for granted or not 'wooed' by a candidate, they get pissy and vote against them - even when doing so is against their best interests. They're spoiled and entitled and on November 5th of this past year, they threw a tantrum and punished democrats because not enough of them kissed their ass.I'm sure this will piss off those who feel targeted. Tough. I don't care what my karma is. The only thing I care about is that American voters quit being lazy, entitled and ignorant, and start taking responsibility for their actions. Instead of being butthurt because you don't feel sucked up to, how about using your internet access to find out which candidate is most likely to help you, your family and your friends. You can do that by learning about who they really are - not who they or other people say they are. Millions of voters *did* do all that. And I'm endlessly thankful for you if you're one of them. But enough didn't that Trump will now be in office again, and they're the one's we should all be angry at. If voters don't grow tf up and treat voting as the personal responsibility it's always been, we'll never get our country back. So long as we remain a democracy, voters will determine that. No one else. And it's about fucking time they get that through their heads.","title":"Vice President Kamala Harris has surpassed 75 Million Votes"},{"text":"2026 music","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"FUCK THIS LAME ASS DEADBEAT !!https://preview.redd.it/p3xlf3srzcae1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=848bb1357ba3e760eebd3b20275628268c11d0f5","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/iipyfvzfzcae1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=221aa95461fb1a9998f6d6b2d7c3637e569699e6","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"??","title":"Vice President Kamala Harris has surpassed 75 Million Votes"},{"text":"Objectively, can anyone name one thing Obama said that divided the country?

After one term in office, voters strongly rejected Jimmy Carter's honest but gloomy outlook in favor of Ronald Reagan's telegenic optimism. In the past two decades, however, there has been wider recognition that Carter, despite a lack of experience, confronted several huge problems with steadiness, courage, and idealism. Along with his predecessor Gerald Ford, Carter must be given credit for restoring the balance to the constitutional system after the excesses of the Johnson and Nixon \\"imperial presidency.\\".??\\nSo Carter was never seen as a great president who really accomplished anything during his term, but afterwards was viewed as someone who at least wasn't a war hawk that got us into further problems, and he was also a very big supporter for habitat for humanity. Most of the press they've received since his presidency ended that has helped them raise funds and awareness is due to headlines about his involvement.??\\nThe post being ridiculous is because it's grasping at straws in a schizophrenic way to try and make a connection.

It's already a nonfactor in determining what people are paid.If you're not willing to move min wage past market bottom, then min wage is effectively staying at 7.25 anyways and the market takes over as it is already doing. But the conclusion isn't to abolish min wage, it's to raise it to a point where it actually accomplishes something. That's what it's supposed to do, force businesses to pay their employees a reasonable amount and continue to push that number forward so people don't have inflation completely screw their wages until it hits the bottom. But it takes political capital, a lot of political capital, to raise federal min wage (unless you go the smart route and bind it as an automatic inflation adjusted thing. Some places have done this).

American culture, while of course available, is secondary to music, tv, film, etc produced locally.While Im unfamiliar with Brazil politics, what stands out for these countries is a political and government-concerted effort to invest in the arts and preserve their national culture. South Korea government actively invests in k drama and K-pop and even financially supports global distribution. Japan was similar in the 80s with the rise of j pop. Thailands government invested in foreign Thai nationals to open Thai restaurants to popularize Thai cuisine internationally. That being said I think you may underestimate some Brazilian culture in the US. Brazilian steakhouses (churrascos), a?a bowls, bossa nova are all quite popular in the US.

The vast majority of people at the time actually believed that government worked for the people, unlike now. FDR was a once-in-a-century politician who had close to 80% of Congress under his control. LBJ was inaugurated just after the JFK assassination. These were special circumstances.The New Deal and Great Society programs also came about during a really unique time in American history. The rest of the world was either destroyed from WWII or too weak to compete economically, making the US basically the only place for global capital to go to. This meant that even though companies faced high labor costs from the New Deal regulatory apparatus, they didn't really have any better options, so they set up shop in America anyway and brought industry and jobs here. Contrast that with now, when there's tons of competition between America and its economic rivals.Whatever the new economic policy of the Democrats is going to be, it isn't going to be neoliberalism or New Deal-style welfare.

Flip flopping on positions because you want to appease the 51% and win power at all costs is bad.

Yes this SHOULD be illegal, but it's not.So it's rare that politicians actually change their minds because of new information. It's usually just pandering.So you're assuming that they change their positions for good intentions, but that's not the case in most scenarios. Provably so. You just follow the policies they enact and see how it runs counter to what they said while campaigning.Now, on the idea that people can be swayed by new information, yes, this is a good moderating force and usually leads to better decisions overall. But that's not what a flip-flopper usually is. A flip-flopper is someone who has no principles or strong beliefs. They will say ANYTHING as long as they get power and influence.

Flip flopping as opportunism is a problem. Kamala Harris goal was to ban fracking, but that would not be realistic, so she *altered* her position to something more practical: supporting fracking while simultaneously advocating to make the transition to cleaner energy. (Unfortunately, she didnt articulate it this way when confronted.) Trump could care less about abortion. Banning abortion is merely a tactic to l maintain a political stronghold on evangelical Christians, for whom abortion is a moral issue. Senator John Fetterman (PA), however, is more complicated. He has suddenly neutralized Trumps insanity and agenda by pulling the bipartisanship card. His state voted Trump, so now hes changing his views at the expense of the Democrats in his state. He no longer sees Trump as a fascist. His position changed rather dramatically as opposed to organically. He may also be suffering mentally from his stroke. I dont know. This is like Sinema (AZ) and Manchin (WV) who kept the Democrats from passing legislation that would benefit their state. For them, it was largely self-interest. West Virginia is one of the poorest states, and yet he opposes legislation that would help his state. He claims the Democrats are too far left.I would argue that most people dont pay attention to their senators/representatives and how they vote on bills. So senators/reps can practically do what they want with no accountability to their constituents.","title":"cmv: Political flip-flopping and pandering is not a bad thing"},{"text":"If all candidates do is just listen to poll numbers you might as well have direct democracy and get rid of representative government Aka candidates are supposed to run for office based on their opinions","title":"cmv: Political flip-flopping and pandering is not a bad thing"},{"text":"A world in white gets underway","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Saw an article about a guy being shoved in front of a subway in NYC.

For one thing our military-Industrial complex companies are recruiting in all the good engineering schools from practically the Junior level. That leaves fewer picks for private companies. For another a very larhge number of available engineering jobs are neither out-sourced, nor can they be. The engineering I have in mind often requires hands-on design and lab work, as well as working in a team of several different types of engineers. As matters stand, india or pakistan are hardly known for their mechanical and electrical engineering acumen. Yes, they do have software engineering and computer science, but again, the majority of jobs I know of have requirements that make them poor candidates for outsourcing.So yes, studying engineering in a good reputation department still will pay of. Most of the engineers I know practically write their own ticket, and several are in their later 50's and still are in much demand (experience does count).I am admittedly less familiar with software type jobs and can see how these may not offer the greatest security especially as many can be done remotely. Areas like Biology and Physics is still a different story. In these areas a BSc qualifies one to be basically a technician. So a master level or even PhD may be a better ticket. At least that's what I advice (BTW, neuroscience is all the rage nowadays, but it still has a high academic component).You're better off learning a skilled trade or becoming a police officer or fire fighter.Going into trades is not a bad idea at all. Most of these jobs are non-AI replaceable and certainly not out-sourceable. Two years in a community college + 3 years apprenticing on the job can get you set for life with excellent income.PS It's 2 weeks later and I am still waiting for the electrician to find some time to come over given his busy schedule. Where I live, it'll likely cost over $60./hr. If I pay a bonus of $200. he can come sooner.Then there's nursing. A huge shortage in that area. Jobs go begging constantly, even with all the Philipino special visa holders.Finally, as i said many times before i believe that those who study STEM fields in College should be absolutely required to take some serious humanity course.

I do what she tells me and I get a paycheck for it. I do much more than the bare minimum not because I feel like it's my duty as a man, but because it legitimately bothers me not to be conscientious. I like work. I find it meditative. I think work is a natural part of life and existence. But I don't think it's tied to my gender. I try as best as I can to respect and appreciate that quality in women, too. I think that we use shame as a social tool for control in way too many situations. Is it useful? Yes, absolutely. Is it always necessary? No, absolutely not.We should shame criminals. We shouldn't shame men who cry during sad movies, or women who choose to focus on a career over having children. (We should probably shame parents who put pleasing their bosses over the emotional well-being of their children, though.) If a woman wants to have both a career and children, she is responsible for making that work with or without a partner and she needs to know exactly what she's signing herself up for. It should just be a matter of choice that's left up to her, though, not her husband. I'm glad society has moved in that direction.

That said, I think I meant it more broadly. Men (and women) who are killed for violating gender norms in ways we find deeply subversive and offensive. I don't necessarily mean fringe cases where a pride parade is shot up, I mean frequent cases where you can meaningfully argue that years of life are lost on account of the stress and illness experienced by men who are disowned by their families and even imprisoned for effeminate behavior, beaten, mocked, etc. and women who are killed/beaten for refusing to marry, or for expressing their bodily autonomy by wearing certain \\"revealing\\" (this definition differs between societies) clothing in public.I definitely think that masculine/feminine roles are a matter of personal choice. I guess I was expressing my frustration when I used the word \\"job\\" as it's a thing that's frequently imposed upon me and other men that I know.Self-pity is kind of complex, too. I think that on the whole it's likely harmless and made out to be much more harmful than it actually is. I think it's okay to acknowledge that you're upset and angry and that you're facing unfair circumstances, *so long as you follow through with dealing with those circumstances*. But it can certainly become a cycle or a bad habit. I'm young and I'm still figuring out where the line is between forgiving myself for my screw ups and being excessively rigid and authoritarian to the point that it does me more harm than good. I've definitely overcorrected far beyond stopping self pity to the point of what you could call self-harm as a means of trying to establish discipline and control. While I've found healthier solutions to the issue of discipline and lacking control/moderation it's definitely an area I'm sensitive about and where I can do some unintentional projecting onto others for sure.You shouldn't feel shame or embarrassment for being human and for having flaws. It's natural. I think that deserves to be acknowledged. Life is difficult and nothing helped me more in trying to understand that than by being told by a family member that my qualms with the chaos and unfairness of life are reasonable, and that it's okay to feel like it's utterly crazy and harsh sometimes.

Extremely flattered by your thoughtful response, thank you!I think where we disagree on this particular point is where on the continuum humanity actually lies.I think I tend to believe that we are much closer to being equal in our capabilities and potentialities than you might think and that men are capable of occupying traditionally feminine roles and vice versa.\\nI fully agree with you that we will never reach that other end of it nor should we bother trying. We just need to be much closer to it than we are right now. I agree that there are inherent differences in male and female behavior that are biological in nature; just look at the science of testosterone and estrogen and their impact on human behavior and you'll see clear evidence of this.That said, I don't think it's something we need to regulate socially nor legally. I'm a supporter of the equal rights amendment and other general social changes that the left is pushing (assuming you're also American not sure).Many radical ideas are born that eventually die. I mean look at political lesbianism, or (as a Black person myself) black separatism, modern feminists and many educated Black Americans today look back on these ideas and cringe, but for their time, I'm sure they were revolutionary. I think that's a natural part of the process of a constantly growing and shifting civilization/culture. And on your point that eventually we may look back on the current social movement today and laugh at how ridiculous some of it was, I agree fully.I guess where maybe you might think it's 40% nature and 60% nurture, I and most leftists tend to think it's more like 10%/90%. Where that 10% is still significant in maybe medical or psychological contexts but not worth treating the way we treat it today.I just think that men can be both protectors AND nurturers, and so can women.And also, that some men are just not meant to be protective and some women are just not meant to be nurturing. And we should respect that more than we do today.","title":"cmv: The idea of being a \\"man\\" \\"manning up\\" or \\"masculine\\" and the role models attached to it.

A lot of the groups you will find those types of views are generally ones frowned on or shunned for one reason or another by most of western culture (and several Asian cultures as well to my knowledge). So if you do find people who share your beliefs, it may be difficult to find ones that don't also bleed over into xenophobia, sexism, and such.

Richard Winger's Ballot Access News is a great resource on all thing related to ballot access. His essays on how we got here are short and worth reading. https://ballot-access.org/ It's a shame we don't have a national standard (a fair one) like we do for campaign finance.Anyway, I agree with you about labels. I don't actually care what a successful party that works for the people is called. Green, Communist and Socialist definitely have baggage as far as their names. Younger people seem more open to the name Socialist. But I'd like something that can convince people of all ages to vote for their own interests. Labor sounds good though it has baggage too.Interestingly enough, the founder of the Greens (Petra Kelly, in Germany) said she envisioned a party that was neither right nor left, but \\"in front.\\" Unfortunately, the U.S. Greens have to keep explaining to people that they don't share the German Greens' foreign policy.Which is why I do think it's important to agree on some fundamental issues. One of my heros, Judy Bari, had a bomb placed in her car. She was an environmentalist who was able to talk to loggers and win them over. She was making too much sense, so they had to shut her up.My point is, labor issues include issues not directly related to the worker-management struggle. Everyone needs clean air, water, land and food, housing, healthcare and education. We don't want our kids to die in war. What are our demands that we won't budge on? And that we can make people understand?The definition of worker needs to be inclusive too, in a way that makes sense to people. There really is a lot of division where there shouldn't be. Tech workers and farm workers and the checkers at the grocery store shouldn't be pitted against each other. Nor should old and young. Everyone is scared of being able to retire, or keep their home, or surviving a medical crisis or inflation.Identity politics (on the right and on the left) are a way to divide us all. I think we could all come together on many of these, if they were framed right. But that's adding complexity. Going for the fundamentals could be inclusive.I think we all know from Bernie's 2016 campaign that people will come together when it's clear that their life and death kind of interests are taken seriously. I think that's why people on the right and the left are reacting the way they do to Luigi and finding commonality.No idea about who is welcome at the February event. When I hear more about it, I'll share.Lots more to talk about.

That should speak volumes.Basically boomers just printed a shit ton of money to loan to themselves to buy assets while devaluing the currency to inflate those assets and expecting everyone under 30 to pick up the tab on that debt.So now were in a situation where my mother has a $5M stock portfolio and pays almost no taxes.  While the amount of taxes I pay go to her social security checks, her Medicare insurance, and running the country and paying off all the federal debt her generation racked up along the way that materially helped her grow her assets.Its like having a roommate that stole your identity, opened a credit card, and took out $35 Trillion in debt in your name.

And then youre paying their rent, your rent, and both your hospital bills, AND the entire fucking national debt of the United States by pulling extra hours on DoorDash and cutting back on avocado toast.
