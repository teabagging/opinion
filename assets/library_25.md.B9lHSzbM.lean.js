The issue is that therapy is far less effective than transitioning for managing dysphoria, for the simple reason that it is a neurologically more effective method of treatment - the former treatment is a coping mechanism, whereas the latter treatment partially solves the problem of being the wrong gender altogether by having that person undergo the correct puberty for their desired gender. Its not perfect or a panacea, and no trans person thinks it is. Detransitioning is also extremely rare, fyi, and your narrow focus on GRS is not accurate to trans healthcare either.So, if you actually cared about peoples mental health - you wouldnt deny trans people access to gender-affirming care.

If you vote by mail you can submit your ballot on election day (need to have it postmarked by election day) and it has 7 days to arrive at the elections office. They don't even physically have all the eligible ballots in the possession of election officials until a week after the election. Then even once they physically have all the ballots they all have to be verified. If a ballot was received on time but there is a missing signature or they can't validate the signature is correct they notify voters, by mail, and give them a chance to \\"cure\\" it (i.e. give them a chance to submit a valid signature and attest that they were the one who submitted the ballot). Voters have until December 1 to resolve those kinds of errors. You can think the process is stupid to be sure but without changing the rules it's literally not possible to count them faster. The legal deadline is in early-mid December for the state to have a final count.

Well, there are many things you COULD think of, but try just a few. Since Trump Tax cuts are out of debt and deficit, do you find yourself ranting against those taxs cuts just the same as immigrants? That is, that inflation was due to Trump Tax Cuts, right? Of course it was - because they had to print more money to give to billionaires due to collecting less.It's as if many stop to think that economics is complicated. WAIT - look at FRESH veggies.

Another take from art history, is that it was once in fashion to be fat, because that indicated that you were rich enough to afford whatever food you wanted- this translated to indicating virility/fertility, because humans naturally want to reproduce with people they think are well off enough to ensure they and their children have long prosperous lives.You still see the opposite of the tan effect today in many underdeveloped and developing countries where the majority work outside in some capacity - the whiter you are, the more rich/attractive you are perceived to be in places like India and China, which shows you have the kind of job that keeps you inside during the day and likely pays more -  instead of spray tan they have things like lightening creams. This is also seen in places like South America (thinking Mexico here but obviously in other places too) where people who have less Native ancestry and more Spanish ancestry have access to a higher quality of life thanks to entrenched racism and colonialism.","title":"Why Is Everyone In Trump World So Absurdly Tan?

Anyone fleeing America is an idiot if they think Canada is far enough to escape the fall out of this though, especially the economic fall out, Trump's tariffs could slow their GDP growth anywhere from .5% to 5%, and their own wee little Trumps are all grown up now and starting to lead the country down a similar road in terms of social issues.

In 2020, he was publicly musing at rallies about a third term. He openly idolized dictators like Putin and Xi who overstayed constitutionally prescribed term limits. \\nThe 14th Amendment was transformative. Its far more pivotal in the impact it has on our government. And its been established for 150 years. The 22nd amendment was passed within our lifetime and the Supreme Court isn't restricted by precedent to inform their ruling. (Not that they gave a damn about precedent.)So let's run down the list of constitutional norms and statutes that are integral to American citizenship and culture that Trump's Supreme Court has weakened:Emoluments Clause - no one ever has standing Congressional power of Oversight - Executive privilege is as broad as its ever been No Constitutional officer is above the law, they swear an oath to the constitution - Justice depth can't investigate sitting president (toadies will run Justice dept. anyway)10th Amendment - weakened their right to control elections. 14th Amendment - Only an act of Congress may enforce it. **Remember, this is similar to how the 15th Amendment was undermined in the 1870s and led to Jim Crow. The Supreme Court took enforcement of the law out of the hands of Federal officials and into the discretion of racist State officials. Now the 14th is out of state's officials' hands and in the hands of Congress. Logan Act - A 200 year old law, unambiguous and came at a  pivotal moment for the founding of the Country. \\nNow ask, who enforces the 22nd amendment? There is literally no prescription for whose responsibility it is to deny a third term president being on the ballot. There is no automatic process spelled out. There is no one who can stop the State of Texas from putting him on the ballot. Someone will have to literally sue to prove they have standing and the right to enforce the amendment. This means the Supreme Court will have final ruling on any future dispute. And you know Trump will dispute it.","title":"Resistance is not futile: Matt Gaetz's implosion shows how MAGA's chaos can be turned against Trump"},{"text":"I agree.

I remember 3 years ago thinking it was odd they weren't preparing her for 2024, and instead mostly kept her out of the spotlight.

Too many celebrities and big wigs. For example, she should have gone on Joe Rogan like Bernie had. She has the quick-wit to pull it off.\\n* Being *\\"border tsar\\"* as VP was a risky play that did not pay off.

While the state votes blue overall, there have been several energy moratoriums overwhelmingly voted against in the past decade, as well as many other random radical agendas (like banning the hunting of mountain lions).People here want their weed, and the HCOL has a lot of people relying on govt programs and support. And in general there is a nationwide shift to advocate for better (not necessarily more) abortion rights.On the flip side, the state as a whole is a MASSIVE producer of O&amp;G, with many large corporate offices from the industry downtown. Im talking about guys like P66, BP, and Liberty (whose founder and CEO is now Trumps pick for energy secretary).There are descendants of multi-generational ranching families who had to get a job, but didnt leave the state. CO is one of the most popular states for hunting, so people here love guns. And finally, many people move and live here because they generally want to be left alone by everyone, including the government.I was honestly pretty surprised to see the data you presented, but I imagine (genuinely) that a lot of people who moved here since the last election just didnt leave their politics where they came from.

There was also a group of kids when I was doing Student Teaching that spoke Like Dexter from Dexter's Lab (Or as it turned out the Jaegers from Girl Genius).And we thought they were annoying as fuck too.Every generation, or rather every few years, there's a new fad that comes out for dress and acting. Sometimes it lasts for awhile, sometimes it never goes past niche level. Sometimes it's every other fucking kid.But it's really about expression via dress and attitude. None of them *actually* thought there were royalty or cats or comic book monsters. And the cat boys and car girls don't want to shit in a litter box.

However, inflation is actually a natural force. Inflation happens if we want it to or not. You are correct, in that, some of the inflation we see is artificial in the sense that a company arbitrarily decided consumers can, and will pay more. However, the idea that inflation as a whole doesnt naturally occur isnt quite correct.Eggs are a great example of inflationary pressures. Egg production decreased earlier this year (or was it last year? I cant remember.) because of avian flu and requirements to depopulate (kill) birds that could possibly be infected. Less birds == less eggs. Less eggs, but sustained egg demand == higher prices. Eggs, at least in my area, reduced in price once things stabilized (more chickens were born and more eggs are being produced), so for me, and Id imagine a sizable portion of the US, got to see Supply/demand in action. Theyve also got to see eggs inflate 15% (Im making up a number here, its technically not important for an example) and then deflate by 6% when supply came back. (Again, arbitrary percentage decrease, its non impactful to the example).Eggs didnt go back to their original price because the company selling the eggs AND/OR the market you buy them at looked at what happened and went well, people still bought eggs at $4, theyll probably still buy them normally now at $3.75 &lt;&lt; thats the artificial bit. Im also sure, likely the farmer, decided Ive gotta make up for the losses of the birds that I had to depopulate, so Ive gotta keep prices inflated for a bit until I recover these losses. Even though the feds/some insurance company will probably pay them out for a portion of their losses, and then eggs never go back to their original price because companies and people continue to purchase them. Everything else is just the economy/people/businesses doing what they do. When it comes to your note on businesses causing crises artificially, that, to me at least, doesnt add up. The spirit of your comment I can understand, and what I think ultimately is happening is more along the lines of: as a business I can take on more risk, and even if I really fuck up, Ill probably get bailed out. We saw this exact thing play out in the 08 financial crisis. A lot of people knew what was going down, or were purposefully remaining ignorant to the problem, and when shit fell apart they went ? well how the fuck could I have known?! And our government said you right, heres some cash. Pay us back when you can. Sorry about your luck. (Printing money artificially created inflation) What the government does about something like that is completely dependent on the size of the business too big to fail kinda thing, so not every company gets the same privileges, but the big dogs for sure get the special treatment. Overall though, the fed/government/people all want SOME inflation because thats what drives the stock market (in part) because profits rise. So your 401K /IRA / Pension or whatever goes up over time, rather than stagnating. Also, if you make more money and can buy more things (causing inflation), you generate more revenue for companies, and the cycle continues. *this is all simplified. Im not claiming to be an economist or an expert, but I know a pretty good deal about supply, demand, and basic economics.","title":"Illegal immigration proponents say we can't mass deport because it'll kill the economy, but there are 10 million more illegals in the U.S. since Biden took office and prices are literally 30% higher than when those 10 million weren't here..."},{"text":"If the other guy isnt promising anything clear, a lot of people would rather take the person at least trying to get them a yacht.

And maybe that is what Bill's (my fav president tied with Obama) comments also prove?Even if the voters didn't lose faith in our government, the election results show they have surely lost faith in the democratic party.Election results **DO NOT** show that voters love Trump. Just over 20% voted for Trump. Just under 20% voted for Kamala. 60% couldn't or didn't bother to vote. Trump didn't win by a landslide like FDR in 1936 with a 60% to &lt;37% or Reagan in 1984 where he won 49 STATES to 1 state (even in Minnesota Mondale only won 49.72% to 49.54%). Kamala had a 226:312 split with Trump. Popular vote was actually close.**2024 was the GOP giving the Dems a fucking SMACKDOWN**. GOP went from controlling the supreme court already to having future assignments the next 4 years. GOP won the control of the Senate. GOP won the control of the House. That gives the GOP majority control in Congress. Trump won the control of the white house. And that gives the GOP complete control of all 3 branches of government. The Fed is supposed to independent and Powell doesn't bow to Trump, but let's not forget that Powell **WAS A TRUMP APPOINTEE**. The states? Now the majority are Republican governors.So this goes to show the nation has indeed lost faith in the democrats. I think that's really what's important here. 2024 was a fucking landslide for the Republicans. Democrats need to focus on that rather than the government. Sure the Dems that still have seats should still represent their constituents, try to check Trump/MAGA's worst actions, and do their jobs. But the party as a whole should reflect, review, and rebuilt differently. How to run the country will be left to the Republicans to think, manage, and/or worry about now since the Dems have lost the people.As for those 20% that voted for Trump or the 60% that couldn't/didn't vote?

As his own press chief Otto Dietrich later wrote in his memoir The Hitler I Knew, \\"In the twelve years of his rule in Germany Hitler produced the biggest confusion in government that has ever existed in a civilized state.\\"\\n \\n His government was constantly in chaos, with officials having no idea what he wanted them to do, and nobody was entirely clear who was actually in charge of what. He procrastinated wildly when asked to make difficult decisions, and would often end up relying on gut feeling, leaving even close allies in the dark about his plans. His \\"unreliability had those who worked with him pulling out their hair,\\" as his confidant Ernst Hanfstaengl later wrote in his memoir Zwischen Wei?em und Braunem Haus. This meant that rather than carrying out the duties of state, they spent most of their time in-fighting and back-stabbing each other in an attempt to either win his approval or avoid his attention altogether, depending on what mood he was in that day.\\n \\n There's a bit of an argument among historians about whether this was a deliberate ploy on Hitler's part to get his own way, or whether he was just really, really bad at being in charge of stuff. Dietrich himself came down on the side of it being a cunning tactic to sow division and chaosand it's undeniable that he was very effective at that. But when you look at Hitler's personal habits, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was just a natural result of putting a workshy narcissist in charge of a country.\\n \\n Hitler was incredibly lazy. According to his aide Fritz Wiedemann, even when he was in Berlin he wouldn't get out of bed until after 11 a.m., and wouldn't do much before lunch other than read what the newspapers had to say about him, the press cuttings being dutifully delivered to him by Dietrich.\\n \\n  He was obsessed with the media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens. He once described himself as \\"the greatest actor in Europe,\\" and wrote to a friend, \\"I believe my life is the greatest novel in world history.\\" In many of his personal habits he came across as strange or even childishhe would have regular naps during the day, he would bite his fingernails at the dinner table, and he had a remarkably sweet tooth that led him to eat \\"prodigious amounts of cake\\" and \\"put so many lumps of sugar in his cup that there was hardly any room for the tea.\\"\\n \\n He was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, or to lash out at the expertise of others. He hated being laughed at, but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke (he would perform mocking impressions of people he disliked). But he also craved the approval of those he disdained, and his mood would quickly improve if a newspaper wrote something complimentary about him.\\n \\n  Little of this was especially secret or unknown at the time. It's why so many people failed to take Hitler seriously until it was too late, dismissing him as merely a \\"half-mad rascal\\" or a \\"man with a beery vocal organ.\\" In a sense, they weren't wrong. In another, much more important sense, they were as wrong as it's possible to get.\\n \\n Hitler's personal failings didn't stop him having an uncanny instinct for political rhetoric that would gain mass appeal, and it turns out you don't actually need to have a particularly competent or functional government to do terrible things.","title":"Trump Is Pissed at (True) Reports He Didnt Really Win by a Landslide"},{"text":"I hate the outcome of this election, but for real this discourse needs to be handled the way Dom handled it in *The Fast and the Furious*:Reps: \\"What are you smiling about?\\"Dems: \\"Dude I almost had you!\\"Reps: \\"You almost had me?!?

Remember the DNC email hack? Same thing happened to the RNC, but surprisingly, only the DNC emails were \\"leaked\\" by the obviously state funded hacker group. Why'd they never get their emails leaked? For a bunch of old men who barely understand how a computer works, they clearly recognized the security implications of segmenting their criminal activity into only secure methods? This isn't some fantasy, we all know they're out there committing crimes on the regular. From tax evasion to matt gaetz apparently flying hookers out across the country to do cocaine off their bodies, they do commit crimes. Not all of them. But SOME. And they don't want it becoming too public. Direct evidence of those activities would be something dangerous to them. That's blackmail material. I contend that Russian funded hackers (unclear/irrelevant if directly ran by Russian government) have been conducting an elaborate misinformation campaign at least since the 2015 RNC/DNC hacks. And that while the Democrats as a whole refused to play ball, a few of them were compromised individually. It couldn't get out to the others that they'd done something or another.On the other hand, Republican leadership kowtowed to the hacker's demands, and that's why this was the only outcome. [\\"They hacked us, but they didn't HACK, us.\\"](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/feds-found-rnc-related-cyberattack-months-ago-raise/story?id=44130951)Bullshit. The Russians got in, saw the blackmail material, and contacted leadership. They worked out a deal of some kind. My bet is either mcconnel or romney offering them certain payment, in exchange for not releasing the emails. They paid the hackers, and the RNC breathed easy. At this point, they have no clue they've even talked to any Russians. They just do little things the hackers instruct. Nothing major. But that sealed the deal. From there, the Russian government has been lording this blackmail material, now with proof they covered it up, over various members of the RNC to encourage that 2016 primary debacle of so many generic but relatively moderate candidates, with Trump being the star because of his uniqueness. Each step of the process would generate more blackmail material. Those politicians would be either \\"on board with the plan\\" or they'd be directed like attack dogs onto their 'culture war' enemies, until they did something. Don't play ball? The media gets footage of you jerking off some guy in front of children. Only takes a few incidents to scare everyone else into compliance. Trump himself is well known to operate with Russia's assistance. He's been involved in the russian mob since he was a new york real estate developer in the 90s. He sold the most expensive home sale in the US up to that point, over $95M, to a Russian oligarch in 2008.Let me repeat myself. In 2008, he sold, the MOST EXPENSIVE HOME PURCHASE in US HISTORY... To a RUSSIAN OLIGARCH!!! [PROFITING HIM OVER $50 MILLION DOLLARS.](https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/why-did-a-russian-pay-95m-to-buy-trumps-palm-beach-mansion/) IN 2000 AND FUCKING 8.Who promptly demolished the property and sold it on. Was this to avoid an audit? To Prevent someone realizing the house wasn't actually outfitted with 95M in interior and decor after laying empty and abandoned for 4 years? Couldn't be that it was worth less than what Trump had paid for it, 41M? An easy way for someone in Russia to transfer say, 50 Million Dollars to Donald Trump? Or just simple money laundering? Either way, that's how Trump, the man who bankrupted his casinos and 5 other businesses, was able to have his father's floundering real estate empire survived the real estate market we describe today as \\"The Financial Collapse\\" They've owned him for the last 16 damn years at least.","title":"Trump hush money sentencing delayed indefinitely"},{"text":"Nah it'd be too liberal","title":"Could John F.

Because of fake news. It's not just a insult hurled for no reason. They had an agenda to push, so they took so many things he said out of context and presented as fact without actually giving the full quote. There's too many cases to provide substance to this claim. But it doesn't take very much research on your own to see that Trump is not a rascist, he's not a nazi, and he's not even out to eliminate abortion. He's also not about that project 2025 bs. He's trying to eliminate big government and put more rights back into the states control. Plain and simple.It's why so many democrats and independent voters went with him. They're tired of the political games. They're tired if big government officials saying they're for us while they pocket millions and doing nothing for us.His image has been run through the dirt by the media because they're controlled by his biggest opponents. MSNBC, ABC, CNN, and many others just wanted to control voters by reporting inaccurate news stories.And they didn't hold back any punches. His assassination attempts was portrayed as not that serious and many hardcore left leaning people are still convinced it was staged; even though all evidence in the case clearly states it was not in both cases. The bigger story in the first attempt was hardly covered on the left leaning media, that had secret service was so inept at their job that Trump very easily could have died that day had fate not intervened.It's not just about supporting Trump in this case. It's was also about choosing the best candidate. Kamala was not chosen by her party. She just jumped in when Biden dropped out, and focused more on her image instead of being clear on her policies. The woman seemed unprepared, rude, and flat out not a good candidate. I'm a person in the middle, not a republican or Democrat. And I felt she was more concerned about getting votes instead of fixing America's problems. Her speeches were given to hand selected audiences, her celebrity endorsements were paid for clearly, and her interviews were few and short in content.It's not about orange man bad. It's about fixing our economy. It's about cutting down waste in our government. It's about saving the middle class. The left is wrong and not about fixing any of these things. They're more or less treating our citizens like we're all children, and abusing the minorities as charity cases and talking points instead of treating them as if they were human beings.I could go on for hours about how this election was a lot of bs from the left. But the Right won because they did the exact opposite of the left. They confronted the issues. They were clear on their intent. And yes, not every policy is going to be \\"good\\". But they did something the left didn't do, they told the American people their intentions. And that's why people voted.","title":"Wanting to Understand"},{"text":"Lol if there are enough prisoners to effect that change then the problem is the country not the prisoners","title":"Trump hush money sentencing delayed indefinitely"},{"text":"Hell get a job at the New College of Florida as a professor for womens studies.","title":"Matt Gaetz says he wont return to Congress after withdrawing his bid for attorney general"},{"text":"Its so dumb that you had to double comment twice?

Every single party that accuses him has some direct benefit from accusing him, where his defense has the inverse, there is no benefit from defending him. So the reality here to me, the DOJ said, we have some serious issues with credibility, like nuclear issues with credibility, and there is no physical evidence of wrongdoing, and we can't even find a lesser charge to direct illegitimate special council jack smith with his unlimited indefinite funding to attack. So we have to  drop it. From there, the house ethics committee takes the allegations from that point and decides to interview the exact same people, about the exact same allegations. Interestingly I believe there are members of said house ethics committee funding his opposition in his elections, which is notably interesting, can't beat him at the polls, what if, under the guise of transparency, we release a report that refuses to point out the serious issues with credibility, and simply uses the allegations as a bludgeon to do what the voters would not.Now, here's the thing, if that report were to come out and differ in some way from the DOJ's investigation, that could be evaluated. If that report comes out and there are new allegations in there that are substantiated to a higher degree than the DOJ is capable of substantiating, of course that would need to be considered. But the problem with that is that I do not believe that a panel of partisans are capable of producing such a thing. It would only have been an attack. Is that a problem, maybe, but these allegations have been around a while, and yet he just won an election, and theres no way his opposition wasn't pushing this story in every form of media.Resigning immediately from congress certainly puts a damper on that report, but surely it had to be known that there are mechanisms for releasing it anyway. It makes no sense to me that he would resign, after winning an election, simply to avoid this report that he already knew was in the works. Not coming back to the 119th congress means that there does not have to be a big fight over his resignation letter.  Could he be trying for a senate position, maybe.

Where we can change your mind comes at the reason a slippery slope argument is an informal fallacy - the structure of the argument is the cascading impacts inevitably lead to the next chain. If we can show that any or all of the causes don't occur then the chain can't occur.So the first causal chain is you're suggesting that Putin is like Hitler. If we can show differences that what you call \\"appeasement\\" to their behaviors, then that alone can stop your causal chain. While many can draw similiarities in their methodologies, ruling power, etc., the ambition of each are different.Hitler's ambition was imperialist by nature and wanted to displace/have power over disparate, subhuman peoples. In contrast, Putin's ambition is to restore the former soviet union to its past glory. So, the REAL analogy isn't Putin and Hitler, it's more like Putin and Otto Van Bismark; Putin is basically Russian MAGA. The other thing is whether Ukraine is *expansionist* in the same way Hitler was to the Austria, Czech, Poland, Ukraine, etc. What you need to do is understand history from Putin/Russian's perspective. Putin's view of history goes like this: Gorbachev, in exchange for ending the cold war and letting Germany unified, the west promised no NATO expansion. Historians/geopolitical ppl/smart people disagree on the truthiness, but it's important to know why they wanted to go into Ukraine.So, what this means is that if Trump \\"appeases\\" Putin by weakening NATO, is it going to embolden Putin to take more territory even against NATO states? No. The Middle East does not like Israel because of the conflict that isWhen we look at Israel, Iran, Egypt, etc., what we see is that Israel has been normalizing trade relationships with arab countries. Arab countries like Egypt, Qatar, etc, have been souring on Hamas and have more to gain with trade alliances with their rich neighbor. That's the express reason Hamas did Oct 7 is they're afraid other Arabs are abandoning them in their armed struggle.But regardless, Israel/Iran/whoever, aren't going to be impacted by what goes on in Europe one way or the other. So this line doesn't lead into the other causal lines.a good portion of the world do not like the west,That's the good thing about being the global hegemon is you lock people into benefiting yourself or being starved even if you don't like them. The US is the economic and military hegemon. US sanctions cripples entire countries. Having control over global capital and having it in your currency, etc., makes it so there's some incentive to get alternatives but alternatives just struggle to scale. These countries would go to ask Russia and china for money and supplies to fight this war in which they would giveI am ignoring Russia a bit, but the Chinese dependency on the US market for their export based economy can't be overstated. There's a reason the Chinese artifically peg their currency to the dollar in order to continue this economy. And China's entire legitimacy amongst its people is perpetual, controlled growth. They'd face regime change pressures if they can't deliver. Their economy is $17T,  the US is 27T. The thing is it would be easier for the US to find other manufacturers than it is for China to find other consumers, especially with the purchasing power per capita. And that's on top of the fact that getting China out of the global market place would really hurt them. And on top of the fact that they are really low in natural resources.","title":"cmv: Trump is going to start ww3"},{"text":"So fucked","title":"Musk Unleashes Online Army on Federal Workers.

Oh hell no!  They lost their job because of illegals and woke people.

Because inside they are irredeemable and Trump lets them not only not hide it, but to actively blame the targets of their hate for it.

OP's display of a complete misunderstanding of...everything certainly explains why Trump got as many votes as he did.Trump supporter: Here are two things I don't like which happened more or less concurrently, it DEFINITELY has to be the case that one caused the other. They generally appear to be incapable of second order thinking, which certainly makes it difficult to delineate cause from effect.Recent high inflation was the result of 1) the pandemic and how it was handled; 2) companies taking advantage of the increasing prices to pad their bottom line.Due to the fact that interest rates had been kept irresponsibly low for such a long time (Trump threatened the Fed when they were planning to raise the interest rates while the economy was booming) that they couldn't lower rates to alleviate the economic impacts from the pandemic, so they had to print way too much money to keep the country afloat.  The fact that the PPP loans were forgiven had a huge inflationary effect, and was completely unnecessary.  Vastly larger sums of money were printed during the Trump admin (including tax cuts for the rich), and that printing of money is what primarily led to high inflation for several years.

Democracies thrive when politicians believe they are better off playing by the rules of that game  even when they lose elections  because thats the way to maximize their self-interest over time.To create those conditions, Przeworski found, it is crucial for the stakes of power to remain relatively low, so that people dont fear electoral defeat so much that they seek other methods  such as coups  of reversing it. That means winners of elections need to act with restraint: They cant grab too much and make life miserable for the losers, or foreclose the possibility that future elections would allow the losers to win. When these conditions are satisfied, Przeworski told me, then democracy works.We often deride democracy as having more in common with sports but I wrote while back that if the NBA had just two teams (the LA Lakers and Boston Celtics), you'd see this play out just the same. Every part of the country not around LA or Boston would feel obligated to support that team in spite of their own reservations, they would call the refs biased when a call goes against their team, etc.Proportional representation in a parliamentary democracy like Germany seems to be the ticket out of this: you have multiple major parties and the ability to create new ones at any time, which puts even more emphasis on having a consistent set of rules, enforcement of said rules, ability for \\"players\\" (i.e. politicians) to switch sides without it impacting their \\"legacy\\", and ostensibly a large population of \\"neutrals\\" watching each game as a moderating force. You create democratic accountability by fusing the executive and legislative but bake in checks and balances through the electoral system to force coalitions and lower the stakes of an election loss.","title":"Trump hush money sentencing delayed indefinitely"},{"text":"My wife told me it's the doctor's fault for not helping the women.","title":"Opinion: If you voted for Trump, how can you claim to care about women?"},{"text":"Hitlers NSDAP party won only 43.9% of the vote in 1933 when he became Chancellor.

Immigration is necessary but should be controlled. The government shouldn't pay for them and they need to stop paying for the world's problems.As far as Big Ag is concerned, most of the companies hire non-citizens through the H2B work program that pays anywhere from $18-22/hr, and all of those jobs are listed locally before they can hire foreigners and contract with them. According to the farming and agricultural subs on all of the social media platforms, this program is going to be expanded, so people who don't work within agriculture need to calm down. I'm not going to pretend to care about the hospitality or construction sectors that are responsible for hiring so many illegal immigrants. Important to remember that if you can't afford to pay your employees legal wages, you shouldn't own a business. If you own a business and want to hire immigrants, then sponsor them to work here legally. Restaurants and cafes are primarily entertainment anyhow... and most of them serve low quality food. People who hire illegals should suffer the consequences along with the people who have come here and not taken the proper bureaucratic routes. Sanctuary Cities should be made illegal. We've lived in 2 of them the past 4 years and the lack of resources as far as housing and the way it affects the school systems is appalling, just to name 2 factors. We don't owe these people anything except a ticket back to wherever they came from at this point. Other countries who are eager to welcome them should do so... (looking at the ridiculous BS from the Commonwealth).Corporate greed is another factor that continues to NOT be addressed. So unless we're actually going to engage in a CLASS war, it's doubtful that all of this will be resolved by deporting millions of illegal immigrants.","title":"Illegal immigration proponents say we can't mass deport because it'll kill the economy, but there are 10 million more illegals in the U.S. since Biden took office and prices are literally 30% higher than when those 10 million weren't here..."},{"text":"My theory: because the blackmailer that went to prison sent in a 17 year old to pose as an adult to entrap Matt Gaetz and blackmail him.","title":"Matt Gaetz Announces he will NOT return to Congress"},{"text":"Biden's 2020 margin was 7+ million.

Robert F Kennedy, Jr., his pick for Health and Human Services, has sparked concern from some anti-abortion activists, who worry he wont be a staunch ally. Kennedy [has been meeting](https://19thnews.org/2024/11/abortion-rights-second-trump-administration/) those groups and hearing their concerns.At a minimum, we can expect some of the policies Trump enacted [in his first presidency](https://19thnews.org/2020/09/the-trump-campaign-is-touting-its-anti-abortion-record-it-could-preview-what-a-second-term-could-bring/)  for instance removing Planned Parenthood from the federal Title X program, which provides family planning services for low-income people. (Planned Parenthood is one of the biggest providers of contraception in the country.)?Abortion opponents also want Trump to undo a lot of the policies Joe Bidens administration enacted to shore up abortion rights where possible, which include efforts to [support military members](https://19thnews.org/2024/07/ndaa-military-abortion-access-house-defense-bill/) who need to travel for abortion. As a reminder, federal dollars cannot legally pay for abortions themselves, thanks to a policy called the Hyde Amendment. We also could see the new administration stop defending abortion rights policies in court, something the Biden Department of Justice has consistently done.Finally, we also could see the administration try to move forward, imposing restrictions on abortion pills ?which are used in the majority of abortions. Depending on how aggressive the new administration is, they could even try to undo federal approval for one of the two medications used. A vast body of medical research shows the medication, known as mifepristone, is very safe and effective.Some abortion opponents also want the new Trump administration to revive an 1800s anti-obscenity law called the Comstock Act, enforcing it nationwide to ban abortion. Trump has said he wouldnt enforce Comstock, but a lot of his former advisers  particularly those involved in Project 2025  support bringing it back.","title":"Im Shefali Luthra, the reproductive health reporter at The 19th.

So I view those criticisms of Trump as being something that comes from that. It's people who have spent most of their lives working for something, and someone new comes in and begins tearing it all down. Of course they're going to be upset about it, and think the guy is an idiot. He's destroying all the important things they care about. But I think those things they care about have become actively at odds with the typical American voter (on both sides of the aisle too. I know tons of people on the left probably strongly object to Trump's goals, but I do feel like removing the entrenched bureaucracy *should* be something that most Americans could get behind).So basically, I just view those criticisms as being because Trump is destructive towards their goals, but I also don't think those goals align with mine. I'd like to know what you personally reckon he was doing with those documents in Mar a LargoThis one I really just view as a *massively* overblown issue, over what was probably absolutely nothing. He worked out of Mar A Lago a lot while he was president, and would have brought in tons of classified documents during that time (which presidents do have the authority to do). I assume this was just some boxes which were left around from then, and never had any reason to come to his or his staff's attention since they were no longer actively being used. And it's pretty common for people high up in the executive to have classified documents in their personal residence.I view it as nothing more than just leftover clutter from when he was president, and I haven't seen anything indicating it had any deeper significance. And my third point is why do you feel he has been unable to prove in court that the election was stolen from him?I am admittedly not as familiar with the election lawsuits as I'd like, so I can't give any great specific examples. But I do know that the majority of his lawsuits were dismissed on standing, not on merit. Basically he was told he didn't have any right to sue over what he was alleging, so the cases never had a chance to be evaluated for if the things he was claiming were true or not. Another issue I think complicates the issue is that a lot of ways to commit voter fraud *can't* be tracked. The central issue is that ballots can't be reliably verified, so it's impossible to prove if there was fraud. Things like mail in ballots not having well established chain of custody. For example, I know California mailed me a ballot this year, despite me having moved out of the state two years ago. That doesn't prove voter fraud, but it does *allow* for voter fraud which would be effectively impossible to trace.","title":"You idiots make up constant shit about Trump, refuse to learn about him, and heavily defend overblown garbage.

Trump put a tarrif on Chinese washers making them $100 more expensive.

For the worlds richest person  not known for his humility or patience  it is a social engineering challenge far trickier and less familiar than heavy manufacturing or rocket science.It is now a parlor game in Washington and Silicon Valley to speculate just how long the Musk-Trump relationship will last.
