Not a lot, but I don't think wriggling out of contracts is a big factor at the high level. The business seems to revolve around easy to estimate payouts as mortality rates are well known, and risk free rates of return are well known, so it is figuring out how to match those payouts to income from investments.  Once that's figured out, leverage up a little but not so much as to risk blowing up.  I'm sure there is a little more to it than that but reminds me of how people described banks before financial innovation: a 252 business.  Borrow at 2%, lend at 5%, leave work at 2 pm.I don't really know how health insurers make money but it is clear they have different knobs to turn.  Their customers aren't really people so much as the employers that select plans for their employees.  The employees are kind of a captive audience that can only somewhat influence what plan they are in.  The insurer can choose what is covered, delay approval, select in-network providers, payouts and deductibles for procedures and drugs, all sorts of things.  The fact the biggest health insurer was denying about 50% more claims than their smaller rivals tells me this is part of the business model.Insurance contracts can be written all sorts of different ways, if it contract is for established standard of care, so long as a cheaper equally good treatment is not available, what does this mean in practice?  As far as I can tell it means that it is extremely difficult to do something they do not want to do.  Where do you go if that happens to you?  A friend of mine had some problem with his property insurance a long time ago.  He filled out some complaint forms with the state insurance regulators and got it resolved that way.  Insurance contracts with  individuals are supposed to be easy and clear unlike business-to-business contracts.  But where does that leave people with complicated medical problems when the insurers are only on the hook for cheapest effective treatment?  I think it means people are on their own against them.","title":"UnitedHealthcare Shooting Sparks Democrats in Congress to Push for Reform"},{"text":"Commuting a sentence is not a pardon.","title":"Now Biden Is Slammed for Pardoning Kids-for-Cash Scandal Judge"},{"text":"At her age a hip fracture actually significantly reduces average life expectancy.

It's basically just handing students a giant and complicated data set over many years and saying \\"Good luck, I hope you're good at inference because we won't actually go over how to construct robust models from this data\\". At least when I was in primary and secondary school the closest we got to this was just learning a bunch of very idiosyncratic causal chains of events with basically no effort on teaching how to properly extrapolate from these chains to the modern world or future. Pattern matching the modern world against these chains is not particularly effective or robust because either a lot of the causally relevant data is omitted or a lot of the included data isn't causally relevant. So you get a lot of weird artifacts in people's mental models. Certainly the bias for schools to teach history chronologically despite the fact that many important lessons from history don't depend much on the chronology is a problem. E.g. if a student wants to answer the question of \\"How/why do wars start and end in general?\\" They shouldn't want to distinguish between wars 2000 years ago and wars 200 years ago. If the resulting model is any good, it should be able to frame the dependencies in technologically-agnostic ways (e.g. information transmission costs or worse/better asymmetric information) culturally agnostic ways, etc. precisely so that it is future proof. But if history is lost taught chronologically it biases the students to overfit mental models to specific time periods. Importantly, it's not clear how this \\"provide data but not inference techniques\\" approach gives people a better forward-looking model at the end than just teaching kids philosophy or economics or psychology or other disciplines focused on predicting agent behavior more directly. E.g. Is it more relevant that Trump pattern matches well against the very specific pattern of Hitler or that he pattern matches well against the more general class of malignant narcissists? We *need* history (the data) insofar as it allows us to generate more accurate forward-looking mental models more economically. But the data is only a small part of that.","title":"Liberal Education and Neoliberalism"},{"text":"Thats the normal, in fact, better healthcare than we can afford all us little people.","title":"Nancy Pelosi, 84, Fractures Hip Abroad After a Hard Fall | The lawmaker slipped while walking down marble stairs inside the Grand Ducal Palace in Luxembourg City."},{"text":"Hey folks.

This creates a push pull effect where by if you automate you get higher productivity and this higher growth but also if not handled properly higher unemployment and when you get that unemployment you get push back from voters which cost elected officials their jobs. But now after decades of neglecting automation you've got a serious problem on your hands because aging is eating away at productivity and raising the dependency which is raising inflation and lowering quality of life.Yet because elected officials failed to pursue policies geared toward rapid uptake of automation technology if implemented now you'll get even more inflation at least in the short run. This further disincentivises elected officials from automation and you get a cycle of failure to pursue policies designed to improve productivity which further causes inflation which further angers voters. At this point if something isn't done to address the issue your looking at potential societal collapse.My advice to developed economies governments is to pursue a consensus on driving as many resources as possible to improved worker productivity. With consensus between the major parties you can do things that will otherwise be impossible.","title":"Leaders of Rich Nations Are Deeply Unpopular.

Falls mean time needed to sit around and heal, leading to less activity which places older adults at risk for things like pneumonia, pressure wounds that can get infected, surgical site infections, muscle atrophy, and failure to thrive in some cases. Opioid pain pills and lack of activity also lead to constipation and often bowel obstructions.The most common thing I see is...Gramma breaks hip, needs tons of help to get around after surgery or refuses help getting around, falls again, cycle continues, may fall and hit head leading to a brain bleed. In women,  they might need a Foley catheter or pure wick during the initial injury phase and during recovery for urinary needs due to lack of mobility, leading to UTIs which can cause altered mental status in the elderly or death from urosepsis. I work in the ER and see elderly falls every single shift. I often see the same patients who return after frequent falls or complications of a prior fall. Often, those patients appear worse and worse each time they come in.","title":"Nancy Pelosi, 84, Fractures Hip Abroad After a Hard Fall | The lawmaker slipped while walking down marble stairs inside the Grand Ducal Palace in Luxembourg City."},{"text":"Misplaced my bad","title":"Covid and the Drone?"},{"text":"Yeah. I don't disagree. One of the Democrats problems is this weird discounting of \\"negatives\\".  I first really noticed it when they pushed through Hillary.  I knew she was doomed.  Not because she's a woman or even because she was married to Bill, but because the right had spent twenty years successfully demonizing her and there was just no way to overcome that much negative opinion.  I feel that part of kamala's burden in this election was her association with Biden and the full court press of character assassination that had gone on for so long.  Now, it's easy to look at this and say \\"well, only the right will internalize those opinions\\" but that's not how people work.  Yes only the right will learn to hate the object of the derision, but the center and the center-left will start to sour on the candidate enough to stay home.  I want to be clear that these \\"negatives\\" are independent from positive attention for these candidates, that is to say: a candidate like Hillary could be popular and hated at the same time.","title":"Joe Biden Commuting 'Kids for Cash' Judge Sentence Sparks Anger: 'Shocked'"},{"text":"Biden couldnt have done anything for Afghanistan since the ANA was already dead and international troops withdrawn by trump, but yeah the other stuff could have been so much better and he chose not to in the name of \\"deescalation\\" or whatever","title":"Bob Woodwards judgement of the Biden admin- what are your guys thoughts?"},{"text":"Read about the guy youre defending","title":"A former Pa. judge involved in the Kids for Cash scandal is granted clemency by President Joe Biden"},{"text":"Best comment of the day, here.Meanwhile, why do so few pols and pundits care about [that huge honking Jerusalem Cross on Hegseth's chest?](https://www.thebulwark.com/p/whats-the-deal-with-pete-hegseth-crusader-tattoos)","title":"Fetterman wont rule out backing Hegseth as he becomes first Senate Democrat to meet with him"},{"text":"She has longevity in her family.

I don't think you can force education down people's throats. There needs to be a cultural change to excise this anti-intellectualism from society. I fear it is far far too ingrained in society though. It is embedded in pop culture all the way down to cartoons and shows written for children. It is almost innate in children that school is boring and any kid that doesn't conform is ostracized. I wish this was the opposite. I mean I wish kids weren't ostracized, but I think you get my meaning. Until this happens, I fear that any policy change to improve the educational system will fall on deaf ears.None of this is new. Here is a quote from 1987 talking about the same thing.This, then, is the new illiteracy, the illiteracy of those who can read but don't. \\\\[...\\\\] This new illiteracy is more pernicious than the old, because unlike the old illiteracy it does not debar its victims from power and influence, although like the old illiteracy it disqualifies them for it. Those long-dead men and women who learned to read so that they might read the Bible and John Bunyan would tell us that pride is the greatest of all sins, the father of sin. And the victims of the new illiteracy are proud of it. If you don't believe me, talk to them and see with what pride they trumpet their utter ignorance of any book you care to name.Gene Wolfe, \\"From a house on the Borderland\\", Horrorstruck (1987); reprinted in Gene Wolfe, Castle of Days (1992)Another from 1954Unreason and anti-intellectualism abominate thought. Thinking implies disagreement; and disagreement implies nonconformity; and nonconformity implies heresy; and heresy implies disloyalty  so, obviously, thinking must be stopped. But shouting is not a substitute for thinking and reason is not the subversion but the salvation of freedom.Adlai Stevenson, A Call to Greatness (1954), p. 99And another, from 1963Anti-intellectualism  first got its strong grip on our ways of thinking because it was fostered by an evangelical religion that also purveyed many humane and democratic sentiments. It made its way into our politics because it became associated with our passion for equality. It has become formidable in our education partly because our educational beliefs are evangelically egalitarian. Hence, as far as possible, our anti-intellectualism must be excised from the benevolent impulses upon which it lives by constant and delicate acts of intellectual surgery which spare these impulses themselves.Richard Hofstadter, Anti-Intellectualism in American Life (1963), pp. 22-23I feel that last one really gets are the heart of the matter. How many times have you heard that \\"everyone's opinion matters\\"? How many times has a debate on climate change been one wacko versus one scientist? That is the egalitarian way. Most people's opinions do not matter and are not relevant. A debate on the news over climate change shouldn't be one wacko versus a scientist. Based on the consensus in climate science, it should be 97 climate scientists versus 3 climate scientists.How do we get out of this? I don't know. I am quite pessimistic these days and think that maybe we need the idiots to absolutely ruin everything before we will have a collective realization that knowledge and education matter, but even then, I don't think it will change anything and people will double down. We need to be able to say that the average Joe's opinion on the economy or climate science, etc, doesn't matter. We shouldn't give up all dissent though, but it should be confined to evidence based discussions among subject matter experts, not podcasts from some guy that was an MMA fighter once.I really fear that one day, a war is going to be fought over this between those that care about facts and those that do not.","title":"Liberal Education and Neoliberalism"},{"text":"I stand corrected.

He was broadly in line with the democratic mainstream during those times, and was hardly a small government fundamentalist. With things like welfare reform and glass stegal, the Dems more broadly only did those after the GOP won the Congress in 1994 and the Dems kind of had no choice but to support some deregulations and cuts in order to defeat the GOP and prevent even bigger cuts to programs like social security. Glass Steagal was kind of out of date anyway, there's no need to separate investment and retail banking, it was a bill for the 1930s not the modern era.

Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union and a lobbyist close to Trump administration, also lobbied Trump for clemency on behalf of their clients, as did Mark D. Cowan, another lobbyist allied with the administration. Trump's White House Counsel Pat Cipollone was officially in charge of the internal White House pardon process, but \\"key gatekeepers\\" included Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Trump was also influenced by a \\"kitchen cabinet\\" that included Tolman; Americans for Prosperity chairman Mark Holden; Trump's former acting attorney general Matt Whitaker; Trump clemency recipient Alice Marie Johnson; and Trump's former attorney Pam Bondi, a former Florida Attorney General.Clearly the outrage is biased as Trump was making money on pardons and we are arguing if an old women at 71 and in ill health should be under home arrest.","title":"She Stole Millions From Taxpayers to Buy Show Horses.

Listen to the unions Im part of a union and in America unions are mostly conservative voters and the point of American trade unions is to prevent other people who cant get into the union from working.

In Europe unions are for everyone who works in that field. Its not anywhere near as much as something you apply to like youre applying for a job (what its like in America). Most people in my local are related to one of 7 families and if you bring it up youre kicked out. A lot of people who love to talk about how well paid the trades are dont understand how difficult it is to get into some trade unions (or willfully ignore that part). Thats part of how companies are able to campaign against unionization in the states. Unions create resentment by being only for some. Theres a lot of locals if youre not Mexican or white you cant join them. We have 2 black people and 1 Asian person in my local and we are in a metropolitan area with a lot of demographic variety. Also ESPECIALLY most of the women with union membership have relatives. A lot of the women are deliberately chased out.Literally only the leadership of these organizations supports economically left policies, politicians etc. the membership is hilariously conservative and views their unions as employment agencies (in America, thats what most trade unions amount to).","title":"If Democrats Want to Reconnect With the Working Class, They Need to Start Listening to Unions"},{"text":"Thats all very good to know- thank you!

But simply put, people are busy, focusing heavily on getting by, and what free time they have, they aren't going to spend it on following politics/economics.  Those topics aren't interesting, and are often stressful and frustrating to most. This leads to a bad combo of frustration + overly simplistic logic + ignorance that equals an advantage for misinformation and oppositional forces to thrive.  Big part why things seem to swing so much back and forth.

There is valid reasoning and frustrations there to be found in that decision. Basically not all that vote Trump are lost per se.

They complain about Israeli air strikes too.?Ukraine is more fickle to western public opinion whereas Israel is more stabilized. Bibi knows this dynamic with the West at this point, they will tell Israel to stand down but they wont deal with their enemies and just tell them to put up with their incessant aggressions. At this point Israel realizes its better off to just keep attacking because of the Center Left archetype you describe, favoring the status quo above all and paying someone else to fight our wars, they know they will never actually abandon them because it would cause chaos.?If public opinion allowed it, Biden wouldve likely support a direct NATO ground troop support of Ukraine and direct confrontation with Russia.

Yet if you do things they like, they dont reward the party, they just look for another topic to try to prove moral superiority. Which is counterproductive to their own ends.Look at immigration. Biden didnt put the clamp down on immigrants because progressives would have been upset. But they didnt vote to keep a pro-(reasonable)immigration candidate in office. So now both legal and illegal immigrants are in for a rough time.Unions are an even better example. Biden heeded the Auto Unions and didnt invite Tesla to a major auto-summit. Which, if you are pro-union, is wise, since Elon is vehemently anti-worker. Elon buys twitter, a key cog in this cycle for the right wing, which hurt us. So called pro-union progressives stayed home. Further, lets look at the striking dockworkers earlier this Fall, who Biden supported en route to a win for the workers. Were we in a normal cycle, Biden championing unions (which he has done many times during his administration) would have led to pro-worker surge behind him. Instead, progressives and leftists spread the tremendously dishonest narrative that Biden screwed the rail workers, and stayed home.?And this all comes down to social media, where people can build their own reality. The Democratic Socialists at my University spread the rail story on fliers all over campus, and the sad thing is I wouldnt be surprised if that rather than being intentionally malicious, they just didnt bother to fact check something they read.And if someone thinks this is a centrist against progressive thing, look no further than the Democratic Socialist national chapter refusing to endorse *AOC* for not being progressive enough for them.

Traditionally, since the 19th century, first-wave liberal feminism, which sought political and legal equality through reforms within a liberal democratic framework, was contrasted with labour-based proletarian womens movements that over time developed into socialist and Marxist feminism based on class struggle theory.[13] Since the 1960s, both of these traditions are also contrasted with the radical feminism that arose from the radical wing of second-wave feminism and that calls for a radical reordering of society to eliminate patriarchy. Liberal, socialist, and radical feminism are sometimes referred to as the Big Three schools of feminist thought.[14]Since the late 20th century, many newer forms of feminism have emerged. Some forms, such as white feminism and gender-critical feminism, have been criticized as taking into account only white, middle class, college-educated, heterosexual, or cisgender perspectives. These criticisms have led to the creation of ethnically specific or multicultural forms of feminism, such as black feminism and intersectional feminism.[15] Some have argued that feminism often promotes misandry and the elevation of womens interests above mens, and criticize radical feminist positions as harmful to both men and women.[","title":"What is the libertarian views about feminism?"},{"text":"So why did he pardon her?

He managed to turn what should have been a moment of historic Western triumph over Iran due to the collapse of the Assad government, the evisceration of Hezbollah, and the destruction of Hamas into a moment of unrivaled American impotency by making it clear that his main goal was to tamp down tensions rather than secure victories, and he alienated everyone in the Middle East by continuing to supply arms to Israel while his administration constantly put out statements warning Israel not to use those arms.

I dont think Carter violated his oath in signing that bill, and I dont think Biden would be violating his oath, either.But I do expect the current Supreme Court to uphold the initial ERA time limit, even though this would be a novel holding.The whole ERA thing is constitutionally a little wild, not only because of the irregularities in the time limit, but also because several states have rescinded ratification, which Article V does not provide for. Are states allowed to rescind ratification? If so, how?This second question is important because the acting governor of Kentucky vetoed the legislatures rescissionwhich isnt valid if you think rescission should mirror ratification, such that only the state legislature matters, but could be valid if you think that state law governs rescission since Article V is silent. This, of course, assumes that rescission is constitutional at all.While a lot of these novel Article V questions are close, you really have to answer all of them in a particular way to make the ERA work, and I just dont see that happening.","title":"Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York is pressing Biden to adopt the Equal Rights Amendment."},{"text":"I know Mark Cuban.

Since then they've scooped up dozens of software under their umbrella and provide the same predatory subscription service and privacy infringements as Adobe. Trials have limited features and are 15 days. There isn't a single person who will be able to learn and judge a DCC app in 15 days. These things are extremely complex, and most people only stick to their discipline. You can be an exceptional animator but have zero ability to Model. Or vice versa.    On the opposite side of the business model, SideFX, the creators of Houdini, offer a fully featured unlimited Trial version of their software. The only limitations are a small render size of 1920x1080 (with a watermark) and the inability to export your scenes into other software. If you want to take 5 years to familiarize yourself with the software you can do so without pirating. For those that don't know Houdini is the industry leader for special effects like destruction, smoke and fire simulation and fluid dynamics. It makes sense for a trial version to restrict your ability to export your creations for rendering elsewhere. SideFX also offers an indie license for $200/year for budding studios making less than 100k/year. Their regular perpetual license in comparison is $7000 + the cost of version upgrades. And it's worth every penny.I have nothing but good things to say about SideFX buuutttt...- Autodesk's trials are 30 days, which is the same as they've always been. They also have no limitations on what you can do. \\n- Maya and 3dsmax also have \\"indie\\" licenses with similar stipulations to Houdini's. \\n- I don't think the purpose of any trial is to master the software.\\n- Houdini's trial limits outputs to 720p, not 1080p. It also can't be used with third party renderers, which depending on your situation could be a total deal breaker to even meaningfully test it. \\n- If Autodesk's policy around trials and licensing don't give users adequate opportunity to see if the software is for them, that sounds like their problem. Subscriptions make crewing up and down much cheaper, they make using multiple versions at the same time much cheaper and make ditching a piece of software and then re-subbing later if you need it viable. Whilst there's nothing about subscriptions that preclude the existence of permanent licenses as well, IMO, they aren't fit for purpose in today's CG Pipelines because...- Taking on a big project that will require 20 freelance FX TD's becomes an enormous capital expenditure. \\n- The choice on which software version to use inevitably ends becoming at least partially financially-driven rather than functionality-driven, because uplifting all your five-year-old permanent licenses to Maya to the latest version in order to use a new feature that will really help on a new project will cost a fortune. The temptation then exists to only uplift a certain number (based on how many people will be on that project) but then you have to juggle different license availability across the studio. \\n- This becomes an even bigger headache - and the main reason I say they aren't fit for purpose _now_ - due to interoperability; Your render engine or plugin doesn't release builds for your old DCC version anymore? You're fucked. Your version of Houdini was built against a different version of MaterialX than your version of Maya? You're not seeing any viewport shaders on USD Prims! Your third party python library compatibility is limited to your DCC version's interpreter. USD versions, Alembic versions, PySide/Qt versions...I'm a Pipeline TD with 15 years experience and the above issues are always a giant pain in the arse but if you're able to choose your software versions you at least have a fighting chance. I'm currently writing some tooling to get geo and shaders out of 3dsmax and into Houdini. If you want your VRay Materials to come across properly via USD, there's a highly specific set of software versions you need to use between Max, MaxUSD, VRay for Max and Vray for Houdini. Chaos Group actually have a handy matrix on their website to demonstrate compatibility - but its only helpful if you can actually install the versions you need. If we had to pay tens of thousands of pounds in license fees to uplift everything to the necessary version, would we? I don't know, but these questions should be decided by the needs of a project rather than how far through this financial year's Capex budget we are This is a tiny example in an ocean of similar situations - \\"permanent\\" licenses are either a) like attaching handcuffs to your pipeline or b) you pay the annual \\"maintenance\\" fee to avoid this and then you still have an ongoing subscription only with an enormous up-front cost which limits your flexibility. But all this is largely by-the-bt: The idea that a business would look at the lack of permanent licenses and determine that it was therefore *ethical* to pirate the software is entirely without justification. We aren't talking about stealing food to feed a starving child or stealing medicine to cure a sick person, we're talking about software we use to slowly render robots fighting each other for a Hollywood studio. There is no ethical justification for us to take something without paying for it!","title":"CMV: It's ethical to pirate some software."},{"text":"The margin was a single NFL stadium's worth of votes.

First of all, that's a very cold and analytical question you are asking.  I guess you have it in you!Nah, you're still avoiding the question. *You* want us to make peace with GOP voters who are big on culture war bullshit. I'm asking you to acknowledge that you can't use people's inherent rights as a bargaining chip just to win elections, which you apparently seem fine with. I'm pretty obviously opposed to dropping either, but you seem to keep focusing on the idea that we have to make peace with people who have no intention of making peace with us. Trump voters aren't just voting for Trump because of his economic policy; the social policy is what's firing up the base, and they know that. (The price of groceries is more important than whether or not there's a trans kid on your daughter's basketball team, but one of them takes up a vastly disproportionate amount of energy for the GOP specifically because they know it creates an exploitable fear in a way that a dollar on the price of eggs doesn't.)You seem desperate to ignore the social quarrels as though they're not important to GOP voters, but they very much *are*, and we cannot give up on things like trans rights or immigration rights or abortion rights as Democratic platform policies even if it guarantees us a win. It doesn't work like that. It *can't* work like that, or what's the point?And I largely agree with you about wealth imbalance being a focus -- I'd *love* to see a more left-leaning Democratic party! -- but there's two big problems with that: firstly, the kind of changes that you need to make aren't going to be the big, sexy changes that get people to the polls (especially in the short term, when systemic change can either be a bit wonkish or take a while to pay off), and secondly, the GOP are fine just lying about it anyway. (Just look at the recent business with Trump and his 'I'll bring down the price of groceries' nonsense, suddenly backtracked when it became his job to fix it. They just *lie*. That's what they do. They'll make up any old nonsense because they can get away with it, which leaves the Democrats in the position of having to come up with actual policies that will make people's lives better while the GOP can just promise them a pony and never deliver.)That puts us in the same problem as when it came to throwing one minority or the other under the bus: how far do you want your Democratic party to just lie in order to get the win? Because whatever policy they come up with, the GOP will lie about how it's terrible and people will believe it. It's like I said before: you're calling for us to win people over from their side to ours, but their side is willing to say anything and do anything regardless of decency, morality or reality in order to get the votes. If we promise them ten grand off their taxes, they'll promise them twenty; if we promise them twenty, they'll promise them fifty and say that Mexico will pay for it.","title":"I'm Anthony Fisher, senior editor at MSNBC Digital.

I dont think youre going to find a scientific study that explicitly spells that most geneticists dont believe in pure altruism because a conclusion like this is pretty obvious, needlessly far reaching, and generally unhelpful.The way genetics work, like the way every theory in the field is supported, uses an idea that is antithetical to true altruism. Look at fishers principle and read the basic explanation of it: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_principle. The theory demonstrates that equal-sex ratios are stable in animal populations because its impossible for one sex to maintain a fitness advantage over the other. It using the idea of genes being successful over other genes as the entire basis of the argument.Every tenant of evolutionary biology is supported by explaining how individuals with the trait have fitness advantages over those without it. True altruism means incurring a personal cost (and thus your fitness) to help others. This happening is incongruent with the fundamental basis of genetics, and theres little basis in genetics (albeit plenty of arguments from soft-sciences) in support of it. I will reiterate - there is no popular argument that any behavior observed in animals is truly altruistic. We can explain them through ideas like kin selection and reciprocal altruism.There are plenty of reasons why a geneticist might believe that humans are a special case, religion is the biggest one. Some believe that humans are truly capable of empathy, and there are some studies in support of it. Its not because we communicate though or have cars, its because of something called group selection which is woefully unpopular as a field. Regardless, most evolutionary scientists do not believe in true altruism because its antithetical to our very understanding of genetics.","title":"CMV: The collective loneliness we feel right now can be transcended by restructuring society to become less selfish."},{"text":"They arent centrist, they are blue maga.

This creates several major issues that are completely unreasonable to ask an individual to overcome.1.)Search Results are dominated by 5e because of volume. This is an issue because I now have to spend hours combing through games to find a single game along the lines of say 3.5, Pathfinder or Savage worlds.2.)The number of games has greatly diminished over time because 5e sponges up fed up players like myself who can't find a game for their preferred system and buckle because they want to play any game at all after a certain point of disillusionment with the current environment. So there are strictly less games overall now.3.)The cultural shift has ostracized people who enjoy min/maxing or the actual \\"Game\\" parts of a Role Playing GAME.

A democratic candidate that wasn't so closely tied to the current administration had a much better chance. Kamala failed to convince a lot of people that she would be meaningfully different from Biden. Dems needed a candidate that could critique Biden and didn't have an unpopular history. Kamala performed horribly in the 2020 primaries. Her running on abortion meant nothing when she was VP in an administration that *could* have done more for abortion rights and didn't. Dems also ignored a lot of their base by not backing popular policies that appealed to key groups in swing states. Her positions on Healthcare weren't strong enough (she referenced building off of Bidens presidential success, a sentiment that means nothing when people saw rates still rise consistently), she underestimated Arab voters, who historically are an active group of voters, with her views on Gaza virtually the same as Biden (which also alienated younger voters), and for issues she had more thought out plans on, she didn't focus enough on them. Not many people knew of her plans  for investing in housing, which likely would have been more popular, because she spent too much time focusing on Trump being the \\"big bad\\". She catered to groups that would already have voted for her no matter what, and not enough on voters that were either indecisive on who to vote for, or didn't feel enthusiastic enough to vote.Had Democrats run a candidate that could appeal better to groups that didn't like Trump, but felt unrepresented by Bidens administration, they had a fair chance. Trump is popular because he speaks out against status quo politics. That was the same reason Bernie was so popular despite DNC attempts to suppress his campaign. Kamala wasn't even less popular in most polls. A lot of people preferred her. But they just didn't vote. Whereas Trump knew how to get people enthused enough to actually go out and vote, which is what matters. BTW, I think both parties are corrupt.

Everything else from there sort of builds from that premise. First - polls do a lot of analytic lifting for you. But, the thing about polls is they're usually a snap shot, not pre-destiny. So, if we think that campaigns have persuasive impacts, then we know that the analysis should then, not be what the polls were, but what campaign strategy changes the snapshot. Second - to be more specific on what a candidate can do, they can present communications to the public on the pressing issues, right? Exit polls wills ay, for instance, \\"the top 5 issues were X\\" but there's a feedback loop between the candidates on what issues should be pressing and then the exit polls show the reaction. People think immigration is an issue with no small part because Trump's campaign has made that message and highlights events to create the confirmation in the public's mind. Third - to evaluate which candidates could win, we'll have to make assumptions about their assumptions on what wins campaigns. I think the conventional wisdom is that Dem strategists think there's a bucket of \\"swing voters\\" that will switch votes, so they focus a lot on persuasion. That creates the need to balance how much you sell yourself and your vision and how much you attack. But - when we zoom out a bit. The evidence for swing voters are \\"county X votes for Obama then Trump.\\" If the electorate, including at the county level is static, then we know people changed their minds. If the electorate is dynamic, then what's happening is the type of mind changing is between \\"Do I vote?\\" or not - so it's different people voting. The evidence we have is that most voters don't consistently vote in every election. We can call this second model the mobilization model.What we know about mobilization is you want to suppress likely voters for the other side and maximize likely voters for your side. Negative partisanship does this. When you zoom out even more, what we see is Dems lose in 1980, 1984, 1988. They win in 1992, 1996. Lose in 2000, 2004. Win in 2008, 2012. Lose in 2016. Win in 2020. Lose in 2024. When we look at what Bill and Obama have in common. They aren't democratic insiders, aren't bound by conventional wisdom, their primaries shock because they're unconventional. And distance themselves from the Dems in important ways. Bill had the third way, Obama had the opposition to the war in Iraq. I haven't studies Bill's campaign in much detail and '92 and '96 election materials are gonna be more scarce. What we know from Obama in 2008 and 2012 is he ran a ton of attack ads. His campaign was super smart on mobilization. Their data collections and quality engagements are off the charts. Since the people responsible for those campaign tactics largely didn't take up spots in the DNC, they went to his foundation or private practice, the Dems lost that edge. What we know from all of the Republican wins is they also engaged in a lot of negative partisanship. Lee Atwater, then Karl Rove, are among the best. They have won elections because they know the real model for winning is the mobilization, not persuasion, model - and that's why they also invest in widespread voter suppression tactics. So to boil this down: If you have a Dem that has the intuition to buck conventional wisdom and spent $$$ on tons of attack ads, then they could have won. If you have generic Dem using generic Dem advice from all the losing campaigns, then you'll have a really classy concession speech, again.You can see someone like a Gavin Newsom, or Josh Shapiro, or Pete Buttigieg be able to effectively attack Republicans and mobilize the likely Dem voters.","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"By math, are you talking about those sweet corporate donations that also go to Republicans which in turn does nothing for regular every day people?","title":"Comer backs Ocasio-Cortez for top Democrat on Oversight panel"},{"text":"A broken hip from a fall is not uncommon in someone who is 84 and in otherwise decent health.?Its not an attack to acknowledge that as we age we are more susceptible to injury.?","title":"Nancy Pelosi Rushed To Hospital After Sustaining Mysterious 'Injury' Overseas"},{"text":"  truly dont give a shit about help they tried to put forward.Yea, you don't' care about anything but your lies.

But lll do so research on your claim.Regarding whether the rise of autism is due to external components or better testing, I dont know, but lets look at some information we do have.Focusing only on kids for right now; the most widely accepted method of screening for autism is the M-CHAT-R/F Autism Screening Tool, developed in 1999.  Its been slightly tweaked and enhanced over the last 25 years, but for the most part, its been pretty static.\\nFor comparison of what life was like prior to M-CHAT-R/F, in 1995 the autism rates were roughly [1-500 kids](https://autismcenter.org/then-and-now-look-autism-over-last-20-years)When the tool started being used, the numbers recorded by the CDC in 1999 (the first year they started tracking, was 1-68) so lets use that as our new baseline number. As we were actively going out of our way to find autism in our kids now.In 2000: 6.7 out of every 1000 kids. In 2020: 27.6 out of every 1000 kids. So now weve gone from 1-500, to 1-150 to 1-36\\nNo information Im finding, stated the reason for the rise is strictly because of better testing or changes in diagnostic criteria.  Nor because of genetic, environmental or chemical factors.\\nBut the cool thing about RFKJr, is he wants to find out and one of the ways hes going to test is ensuring that its not because of chemical additives that have been put in food over the last 50 years or that were ensuring were thoroughly testing the drugs that come out of pharmaceutical companies.And that should be a good thing that everyone can get behind.Edit:  ok, the way you phrased your leading question was a bit misleading.  The way its written, makes it appear that RFKjr AND his lawyer are seeking to revoke the polio vaccine.But I think I understand why, when I do a search on google to verify, every headline is about RFKjrs advisor petitioning regulators to revoke approval.\\nThis is where we need to learn how to think for ourselves and break away from blindly trusting resources\\nTo clarify your statement; RFKjr has not personally sought to revoke the Polio vaccine.  Also.. this revoking thing, has nothing to do with Autism suspicious either.\\nSo who is this lawyer.  Aaron Siri, is a lawyer who specializes in vaccine lawsuits.  He is assisting RFKjr in reviewing candidates for the Department of Health and Human Services.Why would he want to revoke the polio vaccine?Aaron is calling this article written about him today, from the New York Times a typical hit piece, to which hes currently drafting a response to.Which means; theres probably more to the story than something as black and white as he wants to revoke it\\nLets see what he says and Ill update\\nEdit 2:  confirmed. As per usual; its a targeted hit piece that was deceptive and only told a piece of story. I recommend you reading the rebuttal [here](https://x.com/AaronSiriSG/status/1867662264255300038)","title":"What to tell anyone talking about the 70 Nobel laureates criticizing RFK."},{"text":"She's a good politician.

Refining it down, I'd say it's more redefining culturally pressured milestones and structuring our work, school, play environments to be more group minded. The milestones is a big one. Currently they are college degree from a prestigious school, career advancement, sole home ownership with a decently nice car, and then travel as the prized form of luxury consumption. All of these milestones take a lot of work and are solely individual focused. Not saying they are bad, but the pressure to meet them means people sever relationships as a byproduct by moving, working, studying, planning, booking... Put the time to achieve all those goals together and what's left over is not much time for socializing. It's a more subdued form of 'oh I guess I didn't have time to talk much' in the decade that was my 20s. Within those goals the American model is individual achievement, not group achievement. You get individual grades, individual performance reviews, focus on the house moreso than the neighborhood... Travel is about individual experience, you don't talk to that couple you met in Barcelona after the trip, hence why it makes the news when you hear stories of people actually staying connected. There's never a news story about Jane threw a house party and now she talks to Ximena more, cause that's the standard outcome. Where I think my approach and yours differ is that I think by restructuring to implicitly building relationships, people will begin to focus more on community altruistic behavior as a result vs focus on prodding community behavior as a method to build relationships.","title":"CMV: The collective loneliness we feel right now can be transcended by restructuring society to become less selfish."},{"text":"Congressional committees don't do trials so what are you even talking about?","title":"Jan. 6 committee chair says hed accept preemptive pardon if Biden offers"},{"text":"Which color?","title":"Biden is on track to appoint more federal judges of color than any other president"},{"text":"Luigi is out?","title":"Former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi injured in Europe, admitted to hospital"},{"text":"Dont be so sure.

Given Bernie's own personality, and the character of the people we know he had surrounding him in 2020 and running his campaign, would he be more likely to try and balance the ticket somehow, or would he pick someone ideologically close to him to try and double down on the revolution in the streets against the *millioynahs and billiyonahs?* It's hard to even really imagine what the working relationship between him and the DNC would be like at the national presidential level once he made it through the primary.I guess it also depends when and how the timeline diverges. By the time of the Biden/Sanders debate in 2020 Biden declared that he WOULD pick a female VP, at which point Bernie kinda hesitantly said he \\"probably\\" would too, but it didn't seem like he super wanted to make that commitment. Honestly between the George Floyd protests, Ginsburg's death, the general need to cobble together the Dem coalition, and backdoor DNC politicking, there's a decent chance Bernie might get put in front of the same \\"You basically have to pick a black woman\\" situation as Biden was (though Biden kinda got there on his own anyway).At that point, ironically, we might still end up with Kamala lol, especially cause in 2020 she was trying to run way more towards the progressive end of the spectrum. I doubt either of the Rice sisters would be under consideration lol. Or maybe if he wanted to balance the ticket more with someone from less of a bulwark blue state than Vermont/Cali, he might opt for someone like Stacey Abrams or Keisha Lance Bottoms? Honestly, the list of Dem officials at the Federal level that endorsed him in 2020 was pretty thin, so he might have no choice but to reach \\"across the aisle\\" within the party. Maybe someone like Duckworth would be a good choice for checking each one of these boxes at the same time?

It goes on to make the point  But government shutdowns are a different story. On Dec. 20, the governments funding will run out. Some Republicans are already planning to vote to shut down the government. Democrats, on the other hand, appear willing to help the Speaker pass a continuing resolution, especially if they can pry some funds loose for disaster relief in the process. That would be a mistake. This time, Democrats should refuse to save Republicans from themselves. Keeping the government open and finding funds for disaster relief are the responsibility of the Republican House majority, not the Democratic minority. If the government gets shut down until sometime in the next Congress or theres no money for hurricane cleanup, then either Republicans will learn responsibility or their voters will learn that Republicans are feckless and cant be trusted to govern.

This is a glass ceiling that really requires a \\"only Nixon could go to China\\" moment almost always. How does that apply more specifically here?The messaging between Clinton, Biden, and Harris were not significantly different. Their charisma was not significantly different (all pretty bad). The economy wasn't really even *that* significantly different. Their opponent was the same person each time, and everyone with a brain knew he was an unqualified douchebag running as a populist each time. The difference? Biden was a white male. The demographics that Trump supposedly \\"won over\\" in this election? That's bullshit. He gained very few votes over 2020. What happened was that several traditionally reliable Democratic demographics stayed home... in both elections where a woman was the candidate, and came out to vote in the one where a man was. And those demographics are among the more statistically sexist ones (and racist, but that's likely a smaller factor). Any charismatic Democratic white male candidate would have had at least a substantial chance of victory with any reasonable messaging, against a historically hated opponent even whose own party was skeptical about. Note: I'm not saying these demographics were all sexists or anything. Ultimately, it doesn't take very much to have lost this election. It was quite close by historical comparison to actual \\"landslide\\" elections. Only a few percent needed to stay home because they refused to vote for a woman, probably less than 10% of the demographics that stayed home... which is exactly what we saw... in both 2016 and 2024.It already was practically a coin toss who would have won, according to all polls and poll aggregators.

Party isn't the deciding factor, except for the fact that the incumbent party will suffer if the current state of the economy is not good.Since 1980, I don't think there's been an election where the less charismatic candidate won. Before that, I'm not sure, since I haven't studied footage of those candidates.There also hasn't been an election during that time where the incumbent party won if people were unhappy with the economy. I'm not entirely sure how the economy was perceived in 2000 and 2016, when incumbents lost, or 2012, when the incumbent won. I seem to recall it was in a more neutral state, in which case, the charisma factor may have been the deciding factor. 2000 was such a close election because there weren't huge advantages in the economy or in charisma.In short, I'd say the individual candidate that is running means far more than party, and probably more than anything else too.

To my understanding, I believe Kamala Harris actually has the most partisan voting record of any Democrat.?That's a bit misleading for several reasons. first, Bernie Sanders has been in congress longer and is an independent. Particularly he was in office during the 90s and the 00s, where you pretty much *had* to vote for some unsavory bills. Bernie's strategy, because he's an independent, has always been to sneak riders into bills and that's how he gets stuff done. Furthermore, leftists differ from liberals in that they actually like guns because that's who the fascists usually kill first. Bernie, being a socialist has a record of being pro-gun. This has changed, though. Kamala Harris shouldn't have hired the same idiots that made Clinton lose. She shouldn't have campaigned with Liz freaking Cheney. She should have fired everyone who told her to stop the \\"weird\\" rhetoric.

It also didn't help that there's this undercurrent that most famous athletes are closet (or sometimes wide open) conservatives. Liz and Tulsi are probably thought of similarly by each party, but there was no similar person to RFK jumping from Ds to Rs and what caused him to jump is pretty rough for Ds. Ds would be REALLY well served to just finally run a normal primary. They haven't had a normal primary since Obama. Since then, it's essentially been party elite rigging it for their favored candidates. Ironically, Rs have been helped by their inability to do the same. Rogan is an oddball but his reach and following are unequaled and he's a self-proclaimed liberal who felt that the damage being done by Ds was not outweighing his agreement on other issues. And honestly, all the parties have swung so far left, his \\"liberal\\" stuff is no longer strictly against Rs.I think it may show some blindness on your side that you think those issues are things that poll well with Rs. Abortion? Definitely not. Weed? Somewhere between don't want it, but will hold our nose to neutral. Tax INCREASES, even if on the wealthy? No and I don't know how you could think this would be a winning issue for Rs. Trump is not saying rich people are bad. Trump is saying people rigging things is bad. Rs believe in opportunity and that someone who realizes opportunity shouldn't be unfairly punished.Assistance for first home purchases just feels like ineffectual pandering. I think most Rs (and many Ds, honestly) don't think that would have worked as intended. The Ds have been throwing money at problems for a few years and that's how inflation happened. Housing prices would just go up by close to the amount offered. First-time home buyers are too large a pot for it not to become an issue.Small business startup money? Total pandering and kind of too little too late to try to suddenly become pro-small business. On stuff like this, Trump's campaign was unbeatable. He pulled out this oddball no tax on tips issue that was needle moving just in NV. That's someone who has his ear close to the ground. Kamala's campaign sucked in comparison. Hate him all you want, but Trump was born for campaigning.The main point though is that Ds alienated a lot of people by pushing what are, essentially, internet-popular talking points to a huge group of people, many of whom are not chronically on the internet.","title":"CMV: No Realistic Democratic Candidate Could Have Won the 2024 Presidential Election"},{"text":"Trump didnt get the majority of support ?

If you want to dig into the complexities of Muslim-Christian-Jewish relations across the Middle East, thats a valuable but separate conversation.You made the claim that there was peaceful coexistence between Jews and Muslims across the middle east until the reformation of Israel which is patently false as seen by the thousands of pogroms and subjugation of the native people.1. The Dhimmi SystemYou repeatedly refer to the dhimmi system as if it were a permanent, unchanging institution that defined all interactions between Muslims and non-Muslims across centuries. While the system did impose restrictions, it is worth noting that:The Ottoman Empire officially abolished the dhimmi system with the Tanzimat reforms in the mid-19th century. This occurred well before the rise of modern nation-states and colonial ambitions that shaped contemporary geopolitics in Palestine. (Source) Your attempt to use a pre-modern, pre-reform context to justify modern conflicts is intellectually disingenuous. Let us not forget that the Ottoman Empire, while imperfect, also allowed religious minorities significant autonomy, particularly compared to the treatment of Indigenous populations in colonial contexts.\\nSo your argument is \\"okay yes it's slavery but it's better than death\\"?Your defense of the Deir Yassin massacre rests on an inherently contradictory quote:\\"I believe that most of those who were killed were among the fighters and the women and children who helped the fighters.\\"Lets pause on that: women and children who were helping to defend their villageIf a group of people block the only water supply in a attempt of genocide against another group of people and when the group who's water is being siphoned tries to stop the destruction of their pipelines and is met with a group shooting at them and they shoot back it doesn't matter if those shooting at you are men, women or teenagers you have the choice of shooting back or sitting there passively and letting them kill you.we should examine why Palestinians who stayedsuch as your reference to a grandmotherwere reduced to second-class citizens, denied land rights (this is insane if you read about, but im sure you couldn'tcare less), and subject to systematic discrimination even within Israel.\\nThere are no streets Muslims can't enter there are however multiple locations non Muslims aren't allowed entry.Interestingly, while Arabs can travel freely throughout Judea and Samaria, Jews are limited in which roads they can travel. Under Israeli law, its illegal for Jews to enter any territories labeled as Area A, or under full Palestinian Authority security and administrative control. It is illegal to enter, as the IDF is unable to operate freely in these areas even if a Jew is in danger. Large red signs warning Israeli citizens not to enter these areas have dotted the entrances to Palestinian Authority-controlled towns and villages.https://honestreporting.com/debunking-the-jews-only-roads-charge/There is apartheid in Israel. It perpetrated by Islamic Waqf (Palestinian Religious Authority) on the religious site of Temple Mount: it says - it is only for Muslims.Tourists are allowed to visit the site (not mosque though) but only on certain days and only in certain times. They are not allowed to pray or to sing (Muslims allowed to do anything they want). However, out of eleven gates non-Muslims allowed to enter the site only through one. All other 10 gates have the sign Only for Muslims.The Palestinian government considers selling land in the West Bank, including the eastern part of Jerusalem, to Jews a heinous crime that in some cases warrants the death penaltyhttps://honestreporting.com/selling-land-to-israelis-a-capital-crime-in-the-palestinian-authority/.For Israel to become an apartheid state it would have to do any of the following:Pass a law nullifying the political rights of its non-Jewish citizensPass laws forcing its Arab citizens to live only in certain areasEthnically segregate the public domain (In SA everything.

These are unrelated conflicts with distinct dynamics, and invoking them does little to address the core issue: the ongoing displacement, disenfranchisement, and subjugation of Palestinians within a territory they have inhabited for centuries.I'll stop trying to tie Palestinians declaring rulership and attempting genocide on the Israelis, the Lebanese, the Jordanians, the Iraqis and the Egyptians with history when they stop repeating their same patterns with every country they make land grabs towards, attempt genocide against then play the victim.","title":"cmv: the unity of the Palestinian movement, especially regarding Oct 7, is to its detriment and the detriment of Palestinian lives"},{"text":"You got the name of that person?","title":"One of the people who got their sentenced commuted by Biden today was one of the Kids-for-Cash judges.

Do you really disagree with this? This seems pretty obvious, no-brainer to me, and not at all controversial.I disagree that women are oppressed, at least in the west, yes. Are there societal pressures on women to conform or behave a certain way? Yes, absolutely. We all have societal pressures to do certain things. To go to college, to obtain a good job, to get married, to have children. We, however, have the choice not to do these things. The fact that we act outside of societal pressures doesn't make us oppressed.I tend to reserve the word oppression for more sinister acts like the former Jim Crow laws in the southern US, the 1980s crack epidemic drug war that disproportionately affected black people due to crack being treated as a more serious crime than regular cocaine that was preferred by, mostly upper-middle class, white people. The Palestinians in Gaza/West Bank, the Uygur Muslims in China, and women in the Middle East and Africa who are treated as second class citizens by their families and government. To me this is actual oppression when it is a matter of law/force, rather than just how someone feels or a perceived barrier to entry.

I do not believe automation is going to replace the intense demand for service jobs, though it may change what services get provided and how. I believe that nursing, therapy, education, paralegal, delivery, and food service jobs are going to remain strong in demand.\\n- Trades. Good God does the Bay Area, for example, need good tradesmen and tradeswomen. This is the part of green energy I think people miss: no, you don't necessarily need a bunch of people running your solar plant, but it seems to me we could sure use people to help fix and install appliances, upgrade networks, figure out how to make their homes more efficient, and so forth C not to mention help maintain the hundreds of thousands of solar installations people have built for themselves.\\n- Engineering: Not just software, we should be looking at how to turn people into civil, mechanical, industrial engineers. Also: chemical, petroleum and nuclear engineering C though those rankle many on the left, I think we're still going to need them, and might actually make the easiest transitions to the professional class for many coal miners, taking that example again.\\n- Law enforcement: The left has probably talked themselves out of these jobs.

It operates through inequalities at the level of the law and the state, but also through the home and the workplace. It is upheld by powerful cultural norms and supported by tradition, education and religion. It reproduces itself endlessly through these norms and structures, which are themselves patriarchal in nature; and thus it has a way of seeming natural or inevitable, or else, in a liberal context, it is obscured by piecemeal advances in gender equality. Because it offers the idea of a structure of power relations, rather than a series of specific sexist acts, patriarchy accommodates the idea that not all men enthusiastically uphold it or benefit equally from it; and that some women may, on the other hand, do a great deal towards supporting it. It also allows for the fact that however much we might loathe it, we all, perforce, participate in it.[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/22/the-age-of-patriarchy-how-an-unfashionable-idea-became-a-rallying-cry-for-feminism-today](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/22/the-age-of-patriarchy-how-an-unfashionable-idea-became-a-rallying-cry-for-feminism-today)While this article does describe what you said, it also describes what I said.
