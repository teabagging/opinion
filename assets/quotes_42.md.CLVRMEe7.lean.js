The author of both, an atheist, makes the clear in more detail than I do here.I assume you're using the definition of atheism as being a lack of belief in God?  In that case, atheism is not a position; it's a state of mind.  It's like if I tell you I lack a belief that democracy is the best form of government.  That doesn't tell you what I think is best, or even if I think there *is* a best.  If you tell me you lack a belief in God, that doesn't mean you don't have beliefs.  It just means you are concealing them, or that you aren't even aware of your own beliefs.  Again, you'd be surprised how easily that can go awry.I'm not even arguing that Theism is right, or that you should believe it.  If you've looked at the evidence and come to the conclusion that something else, e.g. Materialism, is more likely to be true, you should believe that instead!  It's the method I'm looking at here.

Why would I spend time trying to covey personal experiences to someone who wont believe me? God can carry that part of the argument himself.

The rational arguments that lead to God are complex and when theyre simplified enough to be encapsulated into arguments on the internet theyre missing a lot of depth.Entire books like Mere Christianity and Cold Case Christianity do a great job laying out rational cases for the existence of the Christian God.

The existence of God as a character is therefore immaterial as to whether they should be believed in.The problem is always that you first have to agree it should be looked at analytically using the mechanisms people generally use to disprove things. People generally do not.","title":"CMV: The Burden of Proof Does Not Fall Upon Atheists"},{"text":"Well, there a few: of course the Roman Cincinnatus, who was Washington's model; the Venetian Doges, who were intentionally elected at older ages so they would either soon die in office or voluntarily step down due to ill-health; King Carlos 1 of Spain who always saw himself as the transition to democracy after Franco; Tanzania's Julius Nyere who soured on Soviet communism; and Mozambique's Chissano, who stepped down early to allow a democratic government to form.

They're axiomatic beliefs we hold because they create a better world, not because we can prove them in a lab.The real question isn't about burden of proof, but about different types of evidence.

If the Christian in this scenario is unaware of the reasons why, from a logical perspective, the burden of proof is on their claim, then one also needs to persuade them of the veracity of that too. Simple assertion is insufficient, especially when dealing with the honest but flawed general belief most Christians hold that their assumption of God's existence *is* the default position that *is* the rejection of many positions advocated for by atheists. I am aware atheism itself does not actually mean a subscription to the scientific consensus of universal origins, the Big Bang, but it is percievied to be as well, even if (I believe, I could be wrong) a theoretical supernatural but not deistic explanation could also be something they believe in and use in argument. What I'm getting at is that outside of a literal formal debate format, an informal persuasive debate attempting to sway another person's position doesn't actually subscribe to those rules and by attempting to force someone unfamiliar and practiced to do so you actually create a very large barrier to achieving your desired outcome. So by all means keep holding to the (correct) idea that the Burden of Proof is on the Christians and other theists position, but don't expect that to be a useful idea for actually persuading them of the atheist position for almost all spontaneous or informal encounters where you might be making an attempt.

The apocalypse is at hand and the world is in peril, and only by trusting the Savior do you have any hope of survival. Do you *really* want to thrust the entire burden of proof on the person trying to convince you? If they struggle to persuade you, you're just gonna shrug and go, \\"Welp, you flubbed your argument, so tough luck, buddy\\"?Is rejection *truly* the default position you should be taking here?I think this idea that the burden of proof is exclusively Christian comes from a bias against Christianity. Many atheists have been abused by the Christians in their lives, so they're understandably predisposed against it. So anytime someone tries to persuade them of it, they raise their guard and expect to be persuaded.But this isn't true of everyone. Some people embrace Christianity wholeheartedly. Some people weep tears of joy upon hearing the good news we have to share. Some people have active, positive reasons for rejecting the default Christianity they were raised with.Unbelief is not the default. Rejection is not the default.Burden of proof is not so simple.","title":"CMV: The Burden of Proof Does Not Fall Upon Atheists"},{"text":"She's making the good folks of Connecticut look like fools.","title":"It Turns Out That Purple-Haired Lady Screaming About 'President Elon Musk' Is a Powerful Dem in the House"},{"text":"Did you vote?","title":"Biden signs government funding bill, averting shutdown crisis"},{"text":"The best part (worst part?) is he thinks he's a top notch negotiator.","title":"Trump Demands Panama Lower Transit Fees or Return Canal to US"},{"text":"Burden of Proof Is Not About \\"Investment in Persuading\\"-The burden of proof is not based on a subjective sense of \\"investment\\" but on the logical structure of claims. In any debate or discussion, the burden of proof falls on the person making the positive claim. In the case of Gods existence, for example, if someone claims that God exists, they are making a positive assertion that requires evidence. The burden of proof exists to ensure that claims are supported by evidence, not just personal investment or desire to persuade.The concept of the burden of proof is not a social convention, as suggested. It is rooted in logical and epistemological principles. In deductive reasoning, if someone asserts a proposition (e.g., \\"God exists\\"), they are responsible for providing evidence to support it. This is because, in rational discourse, claims must be supported by evidence. Its not about power dynamics or a negotiation of \\"who wants to persuade more\\" but about the structure of reasoning. If someone makes an extraordinary claim, the burden is on them to substantiate it. Without evidence, the claim remains unsubstantiated and, logically, we should remain skeptical and reject it.Finally, While it's true that people can walk away from a conversation, this does not absolve anyone from the responsibility of supporting their claims. In any rational discussion, it is a social and epistemological expectation that those making claims provide supporting evidence. The fact that someone can walk away does not negate the principle that, if they wish to be taken seriously, they must substantiate their claims. This is how reasoned debates work, and the social convention of burden of proof is a tool to ensure that discussions are meaningful and grounded in evidence. If you can't back up your claims , then don't bother making them.","title":"CMV: The Burden of Proof Does Not Fall Upon Atheists"},{"text":"I forsee a regime change in Panama.","title":"Trump threatens to demand ownership of Panama Canal 'in full' if 'rip-off' of US doesn't stop"},{"text":"Being a Christian is an assertive claim.

But with that said, like a lot of people who might be considered left of center, I'm not opposed to property tax in concept. But, I do think that the current concept of it, as it exists in the United States at least, is not ideal. It makes little sense to me that people like you who use their houses to live in (and not to live extravagantly, become a landlord, etc, just to be a regular ol' homeowner) pay property tax. I think that property tax has two primary useful purposes: to disincentivize using housing, farmland, or other property as a passive investment; and to be a method that the wealthy contribute financially to society. The first is important, because if property tax were to not exist, then there would be little to no risk in investors buying up every home and, by reducing supply, forcing housing prices up, as well as pulling off similar stunts with farmland at the expense of the livelihoods of farmers and of agricultural production. The second is important under a conservative worldview, because those who are successful are supposed to be successful due to their financial contributions to society. Contributions can be anything really - investing in profitable companies to help them succeed, designing a successful line of clothes - doesn't matter what, but it should be something. Relative to their wealth, the living costs of a wealthy person are often incredibly low - an extravagantly wealthy family with a 'measly' $20 billion in wealth may have each member going through $10 million in their lifetime of the cash reserve, making it last 200 family members' worth of expenses. So, without a significant tax on inheritance, stock ownership or on wealth itself, what's the best way to force wealthy families to continue to contribute to society, even if minimally? I say a property tax.","title":"CMV: Inheritance tax is morally consistent with conservative values"},{"text":"Thats for sure a guy that isn't blacked out, but has jet black hair and he's wearing a black suit while straddling the bench.

If moderates just took a damn stand sometimes, the worst extremists would often be stopped and the best extremists (which is to say those who fight hard for a worthy cause) would often be helped across the finish line.","title":"People who consider themselves very liberal or very conservative, what is your opinion of moderates?"},{"text":" And in the interest of making people compete for their stake in a competition market economy it is antithetical to the spirit of making something of yourself to live off of inheritance.People receive inheritances after prime working years.

So they can take their sweet time to do long range incursions, or alternately this can maintain massive formations for things like defensive swarms that can act to block any threats from passing through. So instead of needing some high-speed interceptor anti-missile missile to deal with something like a hypersonic missile - you put a flying minefield in the expected path.

But I remember like 2/3rds of the class came out against it, and when they were asked why, they gave absolutely insane answers like comparing it to colonialism against the Native Americans. Obviously, I brought up the fact that there are no people in space and (as far as we know) no aliens anywhere near us. So how is it in any way similar to colonialism against Native Americans? No one had an answer to this, they just all felt that it was morally wrong to build new cities in unclaimed territory. Every few months, this debate pops up in my memory. Every time I remember it, it makes mad and sad for how bad colleges have become at teaching critical thinking. The students had this vague association with colonialism being bad, but they didn't even know why colonialism was bad.

But we generally oppose the idea that the government issues IDs. We'd be glad to use alternative methods for identification, such as private bank statements, friend referrals, or McDonald's VIP cards if that's a thing.2. We are sad to witness a murderous event being cherished, but it doesn't mean we like the CEO who benefits from the system that we severely condemn. That is: the government's interference in healthcare. When Obama's policy subsidizes citizens and companies into contracting involuntary health insurance, people sign on things without evaluating the risks. Insurance providers are not clear about who joins their program, and individuals are not certain about the conditions on which their health is covered, since the state dictates those terms. The result is companies rejecting coverages to stay profitable.And most certainly, Luigi violates NAP.3. I'd say libertarians are anti-government. The two branches are miniarchists and anarchists. Miniarchists acknowledge the government's function in preserving the right to property, life, and liberty. Anything beyond that is evil. So they are only anti-government to that degree. If mercenaries can perform such functions, the state should not keep a standing army. Anarchists think the government can be fully replaced by commercial services, such as police companies, law companies, currency companies, etc. The society will operate in harmony under a private law society, and there is no notion of public.Living in this big state era, minarchists and anarchists share the same trench, so it's pretty safe to say all libertarians are anti-government.Personally, I associate anti-government with the right, being aware that many libertarians identify themselves as centrists and think Republicans are right-leaning. In my mind, the political spectrum is a single axis from aggression to self-defense. So commies are extreme left, Hitler is far left, American Democrats are left, and American Republicans are centrists, Milei is right, anarchism is undefined. I combine the economic axis with the freedom axis because the two things are not strictly independent. But again, this is just my personal view, I may be wrong.4. Whether vigilantism will work is a huge debate within the libertarian circle because we don't see many examples in history. While I can't give a definite answer, judging from vigilantism's definition:\\"law enforcement undertaken without legal authority by a self-appointed group of people\\"I would argue it does not work. Because we need legal authority. Even if we despise public authority, private authority is needed. We should trust private authority as a result of the free market; we trust it less with the decay of the free market.","title":"I have some questions."},{"text":"I think under the circumstances you need to readjust the statement to include rape people because that seems to be as often as money.","title":"Congressional investigations find former Coast Guard commandant chose to bury report on sexual misconduct at services academy"},{"text":"If it isnt the insider trading pot calling the kettle black.","title":"Gifts accepted by Clarence Thomas have no comparison in modern American history, Senate Democrats say"},{"text":"Wasn't it Biden/Harris who gave MBS of Saudi Arabia immunity for the horrific bone hacksaw murder of US resident journalist Jamal Khashoggi? \\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/21/bidens-decision-to-grant-mbs-immunity-is-a-profound-mistake","title":"Biden May Commute Sentences of All 40 Death Row Inmates, Including Boston Bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev: Report"},{"text":"You pick on the Dems but not Thomas?

Your wealth's just been redistributed to the car dealers' employees, aircraft personnel, hotel attendants etc., rather than being passed down to your kids for work they didn't earn.

And well to do people of course often embrace tribalism and racism as well, but I find the current trend in younger generations is to reject diversity and community when your life becomes more socially isolated and stressful as a whole. I think this specifically plays into why we've seen struggles among previously Dem leaning voters.I also realize there are those on the opposite end of the spectrum, who see a Dem party that went too right and did 'not' take race/gender issues seriously. Again, I'm not suggesting those issues should be ignored. Rather I truly believe tackling the wider inequality makes it easier to get people to stop giving into the fears that enable such common modern prejudices.Again, I realize not all here will agree with me, but it's not supposed to be an either/or message. It's supposed to simply put the most universally relatable message front and center, to re-frame the fight of our time.Having a shared common cause to agree with, one people from many walks of life can agree with, can break down barriers that enables such prejudices in the first place. Can weaken the propaganda that lets prejudice thrive, and can show the humanity of different kinds of people.I've lived and worked in communities that were genuinely diverse and where people supported one another, listened to one another without overt prejudices. Sure, systemic problems still existed, but people willingly worked together to offset those problems once they found common ground. I want a country that brings back those values again, and to some extent having a common cause to work towards will be a huge part of that goal. I think we need messaging towards that end.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 21, 2024"},{"text":"2021-2024 saw unprecedented job growth and 2021-2022, in particular, saw landmark spending legislation passed in several critical areas.

Women's rights, trans rights, minority rights, protecting the vulnerable are indeed all still important.

By no means do I think other forms of inequality do not matter, but I do think we've made a mistake by fostering messaging that at times minimized the real losses of middle class wealth that people from all walks of life have experienced.Reframing Musk as one of the richest of elites, and not some \\"relatable\\" entity is crucial for us going forward, that's my main point. That of course applies to Trump as well, but the irony is I suspect Trump himself will see his importance shrink over the years as others use his position for their own benefit. He is, and always has been a terribly dangerous person, and that will not change, but his greatest danger was always who his false populism enables to rise.It's not going to be easy, as genuine bigots weaponize disinfo along with the very wealthy, but I still believe the latter holds the most power and strengthen the former, more than the former would otherwise thrive under their own power.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 21, 2024"},{"text":"Mass deportations..at least in polls and surveys are popular.

Agree though; how this 2 year old part was apparently in a tower 20 some-odd years ago is the question. Was this part number originally something else and retroactively changed to these little terminals?

To them, the 2020s are going to viewed in a positive light.However, the same can't be said for country like Ukraine. They were already going through a terminal demographic collapse and stagnant economy coming into the decade, but the pandemic and Russia's invasion has sealed their fate as a nation. Even if the war ended today, Ukraine will never recover from the past 4 years at any point in this decade. To them, the 2020s are going to be viewed as a catastrophe.These are two polar opposite views of the same decade, and both will be perfectly valid and accurate. That's the issue with your view here.

Then I worked in the private sector for 17 years, paying into Social Security like everyone else. So, at retirement I was eligible for a pension from the state I worked for, my state pension is based on how many years I worked, my age at retirement, and how much I made when I was a State employee. Separately from that, I am eligible for Social Security based on the 17 years I worked paying Social Security taxes, normally your Social Security would be based on your age, how many years you paid into the system, and how much you made. However, due to the WEP my Social Security is lowered $580 a month because Im collecting a pension.

On top of that, you have the tools used to remove and install them that are specially tools. This is just a single example, but this pattern repeats itself throughout many different pieces of equipment throughout the military. It's why you get such large military contracts. I would say that there plenty of room to reduce this abuse. It would require a modernization effort and recompetes if military contracts.

But Emanuel went further when Klein asked, If you were advising a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair working on candidate recruitment, who are you looking for?I think independence is a streak that Im going to look for, said Emanuel. Give me somebody that ran against the grain, said publicly what people are thinking  so their independence is a quality that gives them kind of the anti-establishment, the anti-elite tone. To me, independence, saying things that arent politically correct, willing to take on not just X interest group or whatever but even your own partys interest group or leadership  to me, thats the gold mine I want to go work in.Rahm is right. Political independence is a gold mine. I know because Ive been pickaxing for 30 years!Independents are now the largest group of voters. For the first time ever, they have tied Republicans and exceeded Democrats in presidential turnout. And the independent mindset  politically incorrect, anti-establishment, anti-elitist, pro-innovation, anti-identity politics and pro-people  is shaking up politics as usual. Its a mindset that has been growing steadily since John Heilman pointed out that Barack Obama was the first independent president since George Washington.But Rahm has a problem. ?The Democratic Party hates independent thinking, independent organizations, independent voters and independent reform.

And unless the party adopts a new posture toward the broad independent movement and independent mindset, Rahms vision will remain a pipe dream. ?The Democratic Party did not just campaign against No Labels and Robert Kennedy Jr.  they waged scorched-earth campaigns to destroy them.

All have been expelled by this destroy dissent posture. Rather than create space for debate on school vouchers, transgender medical care, border security, universal basic income and foreign wars, the Democratic Party banishes people who dont toe the party line. ?Rank-and-file independents fare no better than influencers. In 2024, the Democratic Party cancelled their presidential primary, preferring to first insulate Biden and then crown Harris. Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) said, This is a disaster and was ignored.Democrats aggressively opposed ballot referenda for open primaries across the country and adopted an official policy of if you want to vote in the primaries, you need to join the Democratic Party. Thats not smart if you want to attract independent-minded candidates. ?\\nRahm, if you want to gain access to the gold mine, your party needs to stop attacking the gold miners.The Democratic Party should welcome independent political initiatives and candidacies because healthy competition lifts all boats. It should support a primary system that cannot be cancelled by a few insiders and includes independents. It should embrace debate. If the party does that, maybe, just maybe, Rahm will be able to recruit independent-minded Democrats to run for office. ?Maybe the Democrats will get the message, but Im not holding my breath.

In the USA they were imported from Prussian State-run universities, mostly out of prestige envy as far as I can tell. A few independently privately run grant programs existed early on from people like Carnegie, but it wasn't until you started seeing a lot of government intervention into colleges that PHD programs became a normal thing.We are talking mid to late 19th century to early 20th century in the USA.This is something they did with full knowledge. They know that most people work for a living and can't really get into travelling, seeing the world, or deep philosophy due to lack of time and funds. So people depend on collecting information about the world, science, arts, and events through reading publications... books, papers, etc.  And through controlling grant programs these people depend on they can more or less loosely control who and what gets published. Which means they can indirectly control the flow of information the public has access to.So the answer to the question when people ask \\"When did the higher level educational system became so pro-state?\\" the mostly correct answer \\"Always. It was by design\\". At least once you get past masters or so there really isn't much market value.  Because after that you should be at the point were you are generating new knowledge by doing and accomplishing things in the real world. Which is not really possible in a academic environment.Prior to state universities (or at least heavily subsidized education systepm) higher level philosophy and academic work was carried out by religious institutions or the idle rich.  You didn't have people do it professionally.Which is also why when ever you hear somebody calling themselves a \\"Public Intellectual\\" you should instantly be suspicious of anything they have to say.","title":"Intellectuals will never accept: visceral hatred for capitalism stems from the frustration of feeling irrelevant."},{"text":"I agree with all of that.

Look around. Most of them need the money. Then there are the disabled people, spouses of retirees or disabled people, widows and widowers, minor children of the deceased, and certain adults proven disabled in childhood, collecting Social Security. What would you do with those people?The long-term shortfall for Social Security over the next 75 years is about 1.3 percent of GDP. For that much additional money, we could pay all benefits promised into the indefinite future. The money doesn't have to come out of payroll either. There are many ways to fill that hole.And why should we? Because 20 or 40 years from now, there will likely still be 2/3rds of seniors getting more than half their income from SSA, two in five seniors lifted above the poverty line because of Social Security, and one in five dependent upon only Social Security. This is especially true when considering the long run deterioration of wages generally compared to productivity.Productivity itself has been eaten up almost entirely by very wealthy people. We could tax them.Otherwise, tens of millions of old people will suffer. And you know who else will suffer with them? Their families. Family members will need to divert the productive facilities from attaining their own wealth to taking care of seniors. Generational poverty grows. Upward mobility declines.Then there is the economy.

All that I own has been earned and accumulated honestly and it  has all been taxed. When I spend it, it gets taxed again. Real property is taxed annually, even when there has been no transaction or transfer of any kind. If I understand correctly, if I choose to leave a child up to $999,999, you would not tax that. One dollar more would allow the government permission to forcibly take a percentage of that money. First, the arbitrary amount is bothersome. Who gets to decide where to stay that line and why? Wealthy often means has more than I do and is very subjective. Furthermore, $999,999 is worth considerably less in Southern California than in rural Nebraska. How can any law like this be applied fairly?If a millionaire or billionaire opens a joint investment account with a child while still alive, doesnt it legally already belong to the child?  The same could be said for real estate or any number of assets. Income tax in the U.S. is treated similarly and it is not a fair or just system. Everyone pays x% up to a certain amount of income and then the next dollar is taxed at (x+y)%. Why does the government get to take more of that next dollar?  What did they do to deserve more?A flat consumption tax (with exemptions for groceries and medical expenses) is the most fair system available. People who make a lot of money tend to spend a lot of money. They will naturally pay more in taxes. If they dont spend it, they will be investing it somewhere and it will typically be used in ways to stimulate the economy. Why tax that and reduce that incentive?With the flat consumption tax, the child who receives a fat inheritance will be taxed in every dollar they spend, so they dont escape taxes. In fact, they will very likely pay more than most people.","title":"CMV: Inheritance tax is morally consistent with conservative values"},{"text":"Spot on.

Well, where do people think these politicians come from? They dont fall out of the sky. They dont pass through a membrane from some other reality.\\nThey come from American parents, American families, American homes, American schools, American churches, American businesses, American universities, and theyre elected by American citizens.This is the best we can do, folks. This is what we have to offer. Its what our system produces. Garbage ingarbage out.\\nIf you have selfish, ignorant citizensif you have selfish, ignorant citizens, youre gunna get selfish, ignorant leaders. And term limits aint gunna do ya any good.

This country was bought and sold and paid for a long time ago. This shit they shuffle around every four years? Pfft! Pfft! [masturbation gestures] It doesnt mean a fucking thing.And secondly, I dont vote because I believe if you vote you have no right to complain. People like to twist that around, I know. They say, Well, if you dont vote you have no right to complain. But wheres the logic in that?If you vote and you elect dishonest, incompetent people and they get into office and screw everything up, well, you are responsible for what they have done. You caused the problem. You voted them in. You have no right to complain.\\nI, on the other handwho did not votewho did not votewho, in fact, did not even leave the house on Election Day, am in no way responsible for what these people have done and have every right to complain as loud as I want about the mess you created that I had nothing to do with.So, I know that a little later on this year youre gunna have another one of those really swell presidential elections that you like so  much [Bill Clinton v. Bob Dole]. You enjoy yourselves; itll be a lot of fun. Im sure as soon as the election is over your country will improve immediately.\\nAs for me, Ill be home on that day, doing essentially the same thing as you.

There are two Federal pension systems  CSRS for workers who entered Federal service prior to 1984.  FERS for those after.The elimination of WEP/GPO (Windfall Elimination Provision &amp; Government Pension Offset) for Federal CSRS employees is quite unfair to the deal later FERS employees get.  CSRS workers never paid in to SS when they were Federal employees and receive a more generous pension + a full annual COLA on their pensions tied to the CPI every year.  WEP has always been a part of their plan and they all knew it.  So all they have to do is get their 40 quarters (10 yrs) of SS contributions from jobs they had before Federal service or after.  Then they get their SS benefits calculated on all the $ they made as Federal employees when they didn't pay into SS as though they did .. which is usually a much higher number than it would be if the calculation was made solely on the income they made outside of Federal service for which they paid into SS.FERS employees (like me) did pay into SS all their careers, but receive a smaller pension and what they like to call a \\"diet COLA\\" on their pensions (which is 1% less than CSRS and SS recipients get each year.)

This is already much more similar to  what a live virus does than to what a traditional vaccine does.The new self-replicating tech is  even more like a virus still, because it induces the host to create copies not only of the antigen, but of the replicating mechanism itself.

They just want you to believe there was a pandemic and restrict causation to one of those two options. Its a false binary. Either explanation is a win for them because what theyre really doing is setting an elephant trap. The objective is to perpetuate the War on Microbes, a taxpayer-subsidised pharma racket in which finding or inventing viruses in order pre-emptively to invent countermeasure vaccines can continue ad infinitum. Either excuse serves their purpose.On December 4, 2024, the House of Representatives sub-committee on the Coronavirus Pandemic released a 557-page report, After-Action Review on the Covid-19 Pandemic: Lessons Learned and a Path Forward. Its finding? A lab leak is the most likely origin scenario, that the Chinese Communist Party was conducting dangerous research, and this type of dangerous research was notionally supported by the NIH [US National Institutes of Health], said Chairman Brad Wenstrup. The conclusion was perhaps no surprise as Wenstrup, a podiatrist and US Army reservist who served in Iraq in 2005, was in 2021 amongst the first outside Dr Robert Kadlecs biodefense clique to push for a lab leak investigation. What the US now euphemistically calls gain of function work used to be called bioweapons research. Kadlec invoked the right for the US to do it in 2003, justifying it as defensive threat detection work.  However for the countermeasure part to be legal under international law, it needs an illegal act by another state to respond to, so someone else needs to be doing it too. Funding Chinese government research into zoonotic viruses is perhaps a second elephant trap as it sets up future scapegoats. For the pharma companies its a win-win too. The US War on Microbes business model calls for outsourcing of vaccine development projects to private companies whose development costs are completely underwritten by the government, whose own researchers get a small kickback in the form of royalty payments while Pharma gets to keep most of the profits from the commercialised product. Its a merger of state and corporate interests. Left to a free enterprise model, we wouldnt be where we are because there is no viable commercial market for these War on Microbes vaccines.   News coverage on the committee report has largely focused on speculation that perjury charges could be brought against former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) chief Dr Anthony Fauci and some of his subordinates who the Committee believed gave misleading testimony. Dr Peter Daszak, the Chief Executive of EcoHealth Alliance, who were the conduit for US funding to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for the bat coronavirus research the committee believes caused the pandemic, was accused of obstructing the committees work. It wants them barred from receiving any future US government funding.Charges against Daszak and Fauci would be popular as there is an appetite for bringing someone to account. The prospect of perjury investigations and criminal charges or government funding bans stirs up waters already muddied by Dr Kadlec himself through his Senate Investigation. It doesnt matter if aerosolised bioweapons really work or if biodefense spending is necessary, all that our very own Colonel Jack D Ripper wants is for there to be a widespread belief that human bodily fluids can be polluted by viruses so that the firehose of Manhattan Project for Biodefense funding to his corporate chums continues without interruption.The biodefense mafia are playing chess while everyone else plays checkers. So to anyone wise to the elephant trap, the House sub-committee report which affirms the need to Predict, Prepare, Protect, Prevent makes depressing reading. Its a prescription for more of the same. Wenstrup and his committee believe that pandemics will continue to be recurring events, that Covid-19 was novel, that it emerged from a Chinese lab and killed millions, that Operation Warp Speed to develop and distribute vaccines was a tremendous success which should be repeated in the future and finally that there was a cover-up which involved Chinese and American officials. First of all, at least five years of planning went into bringing us the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, or rather the Manhattan Project for Biodefense. It began outside government as a response to the October 2014 US government funding pause on gain-of-function research on SARS and MERS coronaviruses and influenza viruses. Dr Kadlec, the architect of 21st century US biodefense policy, was the key driver of this plan. In a 2009 interview published in the journal Biosecurity and Bioterrorism he explained his preoccupation with stopping exotic pandemics, saying: The view I have is deeply rooted in the military, but medical in nature. Within a month of the gain-of-function research moratorium which was an existential threat to Kadlecs threat detection-based rationale for funding gain-of function research and vaccine countermeasure development projects, Kadlec organised a biodefense study breakfast in Washington DC. By December 8 he had set up his Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense whose report was the basis for President Trumps 2018 Biodefense Policy.  Kadlec was also chair of the National Academies Forum on Medical and Public Health Preparedness to Catastrophic Events, organisers of a March 2015 workshop on Enabling Rapid Response and Sustained Capability Countermeasures to Mitigate Risk of Emerging Infectious Diseases. It was chaired by his old friend Dr Richard Hatchett, the Chief Medical Officer at BARDA (the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority). The keynote speaker was Dr Jeremy Farrar, then the newly installed director of the Wellcome Trust. Dr Daszak was there too, on a panel discussing Challenges and Opportunities in Responding to Coronaviruses; Past and Present. The opportunity to be exploited was that coronaviruses cause the common cold, but could be made to be sound frightening enough that people might take a vaccine if one were to exist. The report published after the workshop records an unnamed person suggesting a Manhattan Project for Biodefense was needed. By mid-2015 Farrar drafted the proposal for what was to become the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the vehicle used as a hedge against any future US domestic gain-of-function moratorium and which offshores US government biodefense vaccine projects to commercial partners. CEPI is now led by Dr Hatchett. Dr Barney Graham of the National Institute of Health and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Vaccine Research Centre, who had been researching the similarities between RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and SARS coronavirus since 2006, proposed the prototype pathogen approach under which research into vaccines for one virus could be rapidly repurposed into vaccines for a similar virus. SARS and MERS vaccine development research in the US went underground and under the radar as RSV vaccine research. Grahams RSV patent was licensed to developers of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in 2020. On January 10, 2020, when the genome sequence for the Wuhan coronavirus was released, Dr Vincent Munster, the Chief of the National Institutes of Healths Virus Ecology Unit, sent Dr Ralph Baric an email about the novel coronavirus saying, Perfect! Right between your favourite viruses :-) It was no surprise: it landed where he put it when he wrote the gain-of-function section of the EcoHealth Alliances now-notorious Defuse Proposal which the pandemic sub-committee said had been split up and funded by Fauci after DARPA declined to do so in 2018. Far safer for it to have been civilian rather than military funded. Of course the NIAID knew about the Manhattan Project for Biodefense C it issued Dr Baric with a task order (HHSN272201700036I) on September 15, 2019 to assess the efficacy of candidate coronavirus vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in mouse models. Thats how it happened that Dr Baric was sent the Moderna NIAID jointly-owned mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates on December 16, 2019 before anyone was aware of a Wuhan flu. No one on the sub-committee questioned him about this. Dr Kadlec, the Assistant Secretary of Response (ASPR) who ran the US response to SARS-CoV-2, activated the US government disaster leadership group on January 3, 2020 (source Paul Mangos book Operation Warp Speed), a mere three days after China notified the WHO that it had 17 cases of an unknown pneumonia. No one had died yet. DARPA then notified the research teams participating in their four-year Pandemic Prevention Project which began in February 2018 that the novel coronavirus was the next test (see last page).  And Kadlec said his office spent 18 months planning a joint exercise with the Japanese Ministry of Health on how to repatriate Americans from Japan in the event of a disaster or emergency. It just happened to have been scheduled for March 2020 but was brought forward a month to evacuate the Diamond Princess. How fortuitous, or more likely, how convenient. ...","title":"War on Microbes: The murky agenda behind the covid pandemic"},{"text":"Readers are getting what they want.

The standard of living is decreasing, but historically is still on a pretty high level.So, I'm not gonna do the same, because I'm even more pessimistic than you. The 2020s will be remembered as the last \\"good\\" decade for quite some time. What's coming to us will be much, much more worse. There's a lot of problems coming at us, all at the same time. And each of them will reinforce each other in a negative feedback loop. Climate change will wreck food production and infrastructure, and thus will cause political tensions (wars, refugees, etc...). The easy accessible basic resources are diminishing, which will increase their production costs (oil, phosphates, agricultural land, water, etc...). At the same time countries all over the world are aging which will put a strain on their economic output. Political forces are already trending towards populism and authoritarianism, but when people are desperate they will demand even more radical solutions, ignoring the long-term consequences this will bring.There's currently a trend to hype up new technologies which will partially solve those problems. But they're coming in too late and will probably costs too much to implement. And this doesn't even factor in the negative side effects they will bring. The system simply has become too complex and fragile to be fixed with with those promised band-aids.BTW: Afghanistan and Myanmar are bad examples when it comes to show the rollback of democracies.

Democrats do better in low turnout elections special elections, midterms, and off-years in the Trump era.

Even looking at Trumps first term, in the four elections between 2017-2020, the worst Democrats preformed in the swing states was in 2020 (which they barely won). Even in the House special elections this year, Democrats outperformed Bidens 2020 numbers in all of them, yet when in the general election this same year, Democrats did 5-10 points worse than the special election.

What I hate about this subject is that it's become so polarized that usually all nuance is driven out.     \\n        \\nOn one side, you often have a lot of conservatives who are anti-trans for social / cultural reasons, who pretend they give a shit about fairness in female sports to have another excuse to attack trans people and use it as a wedge issue.  They often advocate for complete bans, which would include things like \\"a high school trans girl / woman who went on puberty blockers early and never even started male puberty.\\"  This includes a lot of groups like the ADF, who want to turn American into a christian version of Iran.  Fuck these people.           \\n          \\nOn the other hand, you often have a lot of liberals who are well meaning in terms of defending trans people, but are also often very ignorant when it comes to sports in general, and the impact of male puberty on athletic performance in particular.  In a lot of states, high school sports have no rules on besides gender identity, which means an 18 year old high school senior trans woman who has only socially transitioned and has the full athletic advantages of male puberty is allowed to compete in female athletes... which is a fucking crazy policy and a massive massive unfair advantage.  And these people will call you a transphobic bigot just for saying \\"there need to be some standards related to HRT and stuff.\\"  There are also often a lot of suggestions that clearly show ignorance about sports, like \\"lets get rid of sex / gender separations and just use weight classes!\\"    \\n         \\n_________      \\n        \\nThe reason we separate male and female sports is because of sex, not gender.  It's not a bachelor party or a girls night out, it's that male puberty gives a HUGE athletic advantage.  If male and female athletes were athletically equal, it would all just be co-ed.  But they are not at all equal.  In my extensive experience in higher level sports, most people (even many sexist people) actually underestimate just how big an athletic advantage male puberty gives people.           \\n       \\nBut at the same time, especially in high school, there are gender related social structures built up around them... so if it's possible to be socially inclusive without compromising athletic fairness, we should try do that.      \\n            \\nTrans girls / women are a spectrum, athletically speaking.  On one end, you have people who never even started male puberty, and have no unfair advantage as far as I know.  On the other end, you have people who have only socially transitioned, and are essentially full fledged male athletes with a huge advantage.  The middle is more complicated.     \\n           \\nBut sadly it's usually difficult to even have a rational discussion.","title":"Biden administration abandons efforts to protect transgender student-athletes from discrimination"},{"text":"We are, but we are also all a bit burned out.

You are right about how social security works and that it is underfunded. However, you are wrong about the reasons it is underfunded. It isn't being used as a slush fund, and social security doesn't inherently require more people paying in than people taking out. It also adjusts for cost of living and the wages that power it adjust for cost of living as well so \\"rising cost of living\\" isn't necessarily the reason. People living longer can be a factor to be sure, but it's not that they're spending more per year.The issue is that social security is structured around taking a percentage of all of the value that labor produces in the economy and using that to provide benefits to eligible recipients. What has happened is that the percentage of labor being taxed has become a much smaller slice of the pie due to:1. A bunch of productivity no longer being captured in wages.2. A much smaller percentage of wages being subjected to the social security tax due to the cap not keeping up with wage increases.Yet the value the economy produces has continued to skyrocket since social security was implemented. We are wealthier than ever as a whole, meaning we can definitely continue to pay out social security benefits, that wealth just flows right around taxation now.","title":"Millions to Get Bigger Social Security Checks If Biden Signs New Bill"},{"text":"It was never about her e-mails.

This meant that current payroll taxes were primarily used to pay current benefits. There was less emphasis on accumulating large surpluses in a trust fund.Here's how the 1983 changes shifted the approach:  Increased Emphasis on Surpluses: The 1983 reforms were designed to address long-term funding shortfalls. A key component was to increase payroll taxes and gradually raise the retirement age. These changes were expected to generate larger surpluses. Shift Towards a More Funded System: The increased surpluses were then invested in Treasury securities. This effectively shifted the program towards a more funded model, where a larger portion of future benefits would be financed by accumulated reserves.Basically, before 1983, the focus was more on current revenue and expenditures. After 1983, the system was designed to accumulate larger reserves, which are now invested in Treasury securities.\\nThis got twisted into thr narrative you were criticizing.","title":"Millions to Get Bigger Social Security Checks If Biden Signs New Bill"},{"text":"(I think it's actually 2/3 the lactic acid, but yes, it is true that in a number of ways (including unusual body proportions), Michael Phelps body is extremely well suited to swimming.      \\n      \\nAlso just to be clear I don't support a complete ban on transgender women in female sports, I just support transition based rules and standards).         \\n       \\n_______     \\n      \\nThis is a very common point in these discussions, and it makes sense on some level.

And we let some cisgender women compete in female athletics even when they have advantages, like very tell basketball / volleyball players, or incredibly fast soccer players.     \\n            \\nThe problem is that you are trying to argue in favor of transgender inclusion in female sports with an argument that undermines the very existence of female sports to begin with... and transgender women obviously cant complete in female sports if female sports don't even exist.        \\n         \\nWe don't segregate sports for gender reasons.

This is because cost of living keeps rising, the number of people on the program exceeds the workers inputing to the system, and the program is being used as a slush fund for other programs.Remember, in the current payout program it takes at least 2.1 people making the max contribution to social security in order to pay for the max benefits for one person each year.","title":"Millions to Get Bigger Social Security Checks If Biden Signs New Bill"},{"text":"Biden is a catholic and therefore believes that nobody should be murdered.

The Social Security Act signed in the 1930's requires that excess Social Security funds be invested in low risk bonds.  That $2.9 trillion is currently invested mostly in Treasury bonds with an average yield of 2.24% annually.  The Social Security Trust Fund owns those bonds and is getting roughly $86 billion in interest from them annually.  It's like if you took your savings account and invested it into Treasury bonds.  You're lending the money to the government to spend.  As the holder of the bonds, you can cash them in when they mature or reinvest them.  Those bonds are a loan to the Federal Government and give a set rate of return.  The government didn't raid your savings account.  Since Social Security is still technically running in the black, it just keeps reinvesting and buying additional bonds.  So when they say Congress \\"raided\\" the fund, that's not even a little true.  The Social Security Trust Fund money is in the same pool as all other Treasury bonds, all of which are loans to the Federal government for them to spend as they see fit.  Where things get dicey is when the Social Security moves into the red.  At that point the bonds will need to be sold to fully fund Social Security payments.  When those bonds are sold, the U.S. will need to pay out their matured amount.  In other words, if Social Security sold all $2.9 trillion tomorrow and sold all their bonds, the U.S. government would be on the hook for a very large bill.  If they couldn't pay it, they would be in default, which would collapse the trust in Treasury bonds.  That would cause a rather bad series of events for the U.S. budget.So the choices are to either cut benefits or increase Social Security revenue.  The easiest fix is to remove the cap on the Social Security tax.  But since that would cost rich people more money, the rich people, most of whom Congress listens to, are instead trying to cut benefits.","title":"Millions to Get Bigger Social Security Checks If Biden Signs New Bill"},{"text":"Paywall","title":"Millions to Get Bigger Social Security Checks If Biden Signs New Bill"},{"text":"Im not a fan of the death penalty, but I really dont want political leaders to do decisions like this based on religious ideology.","title":"Biden May Commute Sentences of All 40 Death Row Inmates, Including Boston Bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev: Report"},{"text":"Miamis metro population is over 6.1 million however, about 15 times Icelands total population.

Reagan tripled the debt and raised taxes five of his eight years in office. Bush Jr. and Trump both exploded the deficit and no conservatives complained. They value the lives of children as long as those children are unborn. After they've left the uterus conservatives don't want to discuss neonatal care, healthcare, education, nutrition or crossfire in the school yard.

Younger people, who are/were progressive zionists may have rebuked zionism altogether.  Now as I write this I'm not speaking of Democrats. I'm specifically speaking of liberal Jews. Most US Jews are liberal. A friend of mine from middle and highschool ended up working for J Street, which is a political, Democrat organization in DC and I was quite disappointed. I would consider J Street to be Progressive Zionist: website says Pro-Israel Pro-Peace. I remember being disappointed with her when I learned this. I would rather argue it out with my hard-core \\"no such thing as a  Palestinian\\" ex because she is at least outspoken and not hiding what she believes or trying to have it both ways. However she also claimed to be an anarchist-communist when we dated and the fact the circle couldn't be squared was lost on her despite her being very intelligent. She'd been brainwashed by Birthright and inspired my hit piece on Birthright. I still am very proud of myself for having beaten Max Blumenthal to the punch in print though he's a far better authority on the subject and prolific journalist than I could ever be. I just remember seeing the YT video made specifically for that one birthright group of kids and how brainwashing and disturbing it was. Embedding them with the military, military drilling, lack of any overt religion but still took them to a rave and indirectly supplied them with molly, then afterwards the group was taken to a bonfire to perform a ritual of grief for the hypothetical jews lost to the Holocaust. Out of respect to her, none of these details were in my article but if she read it she knew why I was dissing Birthright so hard using other examples.Dunno WTF she thinks now. Knowing her I expect her to be a full throated zionist still; and I do know she went to jail recently. It was totally fucked up for the IOF to supply a recovering meth addict molly (methylenedioxymethamphetamine) but she didn't immediately relapse and that relapse was ultimately her fault. At times I blamed myself for using dexedrine and hydrocodone with her and drinking nasty ass Manischewitz wine with her. I've never known someone so proud to be a jew as her. She had a lot of good traits and was a very charitable and intelligent person otherwise, which is why the power of Nationalism is so strong and so so evil.\\nEdit: To Jews Zionism is thought to simply believe that there should be a Jewish state, a homeland for the Jews. None of the Jews in my family nor my Jewish half sister subscribe to this. They are antizionist Jews and have been for as we've been a family. Their extended family is all zionist Jews though. I remember telling my lil sister about Birthright around the time I was dating the Zionist and my stepmom forbidding her from doing it.

His textbook is close to being the bible for the discipline.I think the primary difference in how they approach efficiency and equity. Your average Chicago School would place more focus on efficiency over equity. Whereas people like Stiglitz are more interested in equity or the distributive concerns arising from such allocations. Rent seeking can be relevant to both of them for very different reasons. Chicago School would see it solely from productive and allocative efficiency whereas people like Stiglitz would see what it implies for distributive concerns and equity. Not sure if I am answering your question. But this is my take if I understand your question correctly. That would mean that they might not contradict themselves when talking about rent seeking. It is just they are looking at very different things.Also what is considered rent seeking is very political. Sometimes it is not clear. Consider Bhagwati's DUP with endogenous tariff seeking. A good example with be EV industry in US (not a perfect example since you have competition between Tesla, Ford and Rivian). Here the government is not just setting tariffs but also grants. Now the interpretation in terms of efficiency in a relative term can be different from a distributive argument.

I'm saying this to emphasize that progress is not a guarantee. Everyone alive today has only experienced the fruits of a growing civilization. The 2020s haven't been a great time, but the future ahead of us might be worse if we see a contraction. If that's the case, I'm sure we'll look back at the current times with nostalgia. Don't become complacent.

There are all kinds systemic environmental barriers that keep people trapped in generational poverty and keep them from reaching their full potential.

The idea that the state should have social services and robust welfare programs like WIC and Head Start and Pell Grants to level the playing field is not conservative. Conservatives believe that role should be filled by churches and private charities and benevolent philanthropists, or just with personal perseverance and grit. If they believe its a problem at all. So why would the other side of the coin, a tax to ensure people dont start with an unfair advantage be conservative?

The statehood was granted haphazardly in the Midwest for expansion reason, but it random divisions give undue power to certain interests (aka corn farmers). Gerrymandering is out of control. The electoral college has been abused. The will of the people is unclear when mass media can take the pulse of the populace and then change the narrative 10-1000 times between the start of the race and the election. We are being spoon fed a narrative - so you can debate on their terms. Either side you have engaged - you already lost because the framing of the debate was wrong. And no this is not both sides are the same. Its when you frame the debate in terms of nonsense - one side is fighting nonsense rather than engaging in things that matter. And the democrats keep falling for it (and losing as a result). A perfect example is pro life vs pro choice.

We have it way better than people in the 30s, who've had it way better than before and so on.

That doesn't mean there aren't problems but you can't say life is bad and hard (generally - for some it is). Yes, AC is a \\"better life\\". We take these things for granted. Staying a hot summer indoors with no AC is not impossible, but it's hard. So is GPS - a much, much bigger change than maps and memory - it doesn't only help you  move around but so do the trucks bringing you food and much more. We have airplanes which are affordable. So is TV/Internet - how did people entertain each other in the 1900s? Very differently. The internet allows you to be up to date and learn every single thing you could ever think of for free, from the comfort of your home. It allows you to work from the comfort of your own home, or your country for companies accross the world. Before, people had to say bye bye to their families and move, or find different jobs. We have office jobs which are light years over working in factories and coal mines. You can literally pick up a side gig at McDonalds and in a month or two have the money to visit Japan and South Korea, tell that to someone in the 1900s. They didn't even know what a Japan is.Nations have always been going to war with each other. We used to have massive worldwide wars and invasions. Clean water used to be rare. People actually used nuclear weapons in the past. Fascism and dictators were widespread and tens of millions of people died because of that. Hate and bigotry was the norm - racism was everywhere, segregation, women had no rights. Kids were indeed not being shot - they were dying of many other things which have been solved. Child mortality rate went from 462/1000 (so almost 1 in 2 children) to 7/1000.  \\nYes, there are still issues and there will always be. We will never, ever hit a point in time when every single person on earth will live a fruitful, happy life and have every single thing they need. How can you say life is bad right now?

There was a great depression, revolutions, slavery. There were countless financial crises (2008, at least a few very notable ones in the 1900s).

There are issues, many of them get fixed and others appear.The reason the 2020s feel so burdened is because unlike history, things play out at this very moment and we live it.

I think this post is primarily targeted at theoretical thinkers.And I think a condition for this to be true is that money must be of primary importance to someone. I have known few people in my life who were very passionate about their fields and they couldn't give a bigger shit about how much money they would make with their thinking or theoretical problem solving (given they were not forced to care for money because they lacked basic need satisfaction). That's mainly what they cared about in life: to have their basic needs fulfilled and to be able to do their stuff without other people annoying them. It's called intrinsic motivation.On the other hand I also think that in our society money generally takes a primary importance in peoples lives. And in accordance with that there are also many system thinkers whose main job is to provide an intellectual foundation for etatism. I've heard the term waterhead many times in this respect.What makes things even more complicated is the fact that our capitalist system has also useless capitalistic thinkers who built a financial system that rewards people simply for owning capital. They create no additional value, they fulfill no demand, some can simply live of the fact that other people accumulated capital and gave it to them. That's, in essence, unfair and I see no reason why to not hate this. It's a debasement for the people who work hard to make a living while others get it (and even more) for free and it's also a debasement for them who don't have to work hard, because work is maybe one of the most fundamental aspects that differentiate us humans from animals.

Why wouldn't you instead look at how people find those periods in hindsight and compare the 2020s to that perception, instead of to how people were feeing *during* those decades?Yes, the 30s were a rough time overall, and I don't think many people look back on the 30s and think it would have been a fun period to live in C but for example, we've largely forgotten about the *many* lynchings that were happening then, and \\"on the positive side\\" we think of that decade as being the pinnacle of Old Hollywood, for example; Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, the first full-length animated movie, first in color from Disney, came out. It's right in the middle of the golden age of radio, too. Many of the fashion icons we remember from that period are from the 30s.The truth is that \\"how we remember\\" is not static.

And the states that passed the laws had little incentive to track their consequences.Biden directed the secretary of Health and Human Services to make sure federal agencies were ??accurately measuring the effect of access to reproductive healthcare on maternal health outcomes. He called on the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to drive targeted research and data-collection efforts.But the Biden administration has missed a critical opportunity to illuminate how abortion bans are interfering with maternal health care, leading to deaths and irreversible injuries: The CDC has not pushed state committees that review maternal deaths to examine the role these new laws have played.The CDC leads the nations work to track and reduce maternal mortality, spending nearly $90 million over the last five years to fund state panels made up of health experts who analyze fatalities to spot trends and recommend reforms. While it cannot require states to collect or report certain data, the CDC gives committees detailed guidance for assessing whether deaths were preventable and which factors contributed to them....When asked about this, the CDC said the information submitted by states is sufficient to understand any effects from abortion bans.Maternal mortality review committees already comprehensively review all deaths that occur during pregnancy and through the year after the end of pregnancy, including abortion-related deaths, said David Goodman, lead health scientist with the CDCs Maternal Mortality Prevention Team. The current process includes documenting and understanding contributing factors.But experts said that the CDCs current guidance gives committees no standard way to consider the role abortion bans played in maternal deaths, which makes it harder to study deaths related to the restrictions and create an evidence base to inform recommendations....CDC public data shows an alarming increase in maternal mortality in states that ban abortion, said Nancy L. Cohen, president of Gender Equity Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research organization. Our analysis of the evidence and other factors strongly indicates that the bans are driving this increase, but there is no way currently to determine from publicly available data if abortion restrictions contributed to a particular death.The CDC has the power to correct this, she said, by asking states to collect information about whether abortion restrictions contributed to a death.Inas Mahdi, a maternal health researcher who previously worked at the CDC for 15 years, said officials at her former agency know the power that investigating the impacts of policy can have. The CDC is well aware that without data, theres no action, she said. But she added that officials likely experienced trepidation over wading into a polarizing topic without more direct support from the administration.This is a concerning position for the CDC to be taking, especially given that the next administration has not even been installed yet. This is the politicization of an issue that should be treated like the public health challenge that it is, and appropriate data needs to be collected to better understand the impacts of the laws passed and their consequences on the health of women. If the executive order wasn't enough to spur the CDC to action, perhaps something more concrete will be necessary within the next few months to at least try to have a handle on what's happening.","title":"The CDC Hasnt Asked States to Track Deaths Linked to Abortion Bans | The Biden administration hasnt delivered on its goals of measuring the public health impact of abortion bans.

Let's look at some you examples.I don't endorse removing women from combat roles in the military if they meet the prerequisites outlined in the fitness examinations that are required for them. If a woman can meet those requirements then that is consistent with my view of meritocracy. I DO support the idea that women having children should be a cultural value. I would assert that women being valued as mothers is not a hierarchical juxtaposition that places women as subservient to men. Quite the opposite, I would say mothers should be revered as providing a uniquely valuable role and regarded as noble for their place in society as equal with a man or woman who contributes in the labor market, if not slightly more so.From a strictly utilitarian perspective, the average person produces a significant surplus of material value in their lifetime by performing basic tasks relative to the cost of providing fundamental material needs such as food and shelter. This is just a mathematical fact. People add surplus economic value by simply existing and having a job.While I am not a Christian, I DO think the push to abandon Christian values, particularly where it pertains to family values, is a mistake. If we REALLY want Equality, it is well documented that there is a much stronger correlation with scholastic achievement and parental support than there is with ethnicity, and by extension, the role that scholastic achievement plays in job opportunities. Rather than DEI initiatives, I would much rather see a return to supporting traditional family structures since they are PROVEN to generate the most scholastic success. The overwhelming majority of the failure of minorities in school systems can be attributed to the prevalence of absent fathers and broken families in their communities.","title":"CMV: Inheritance tax is morally consistent with conservative values"},{"text":"Those in charge now shouldnt be influenced by those arent right now.

I still get downvoted because Democratic voters think that because Republican politicians are bad, that makes every Democratic politician honest nobility by comparison, and you can't criticize them for enabling sex crimes or else you're a bad person.

If a republican does it, it's a really bad and needs to be punished, if a Democratic politician doesn't want to pursue Justice against it, then it was my fault and I need to get downvoted because the Democratic politicians have a noble reason for ignoring a crime like that and victims of sex crimes need to suck it up and shut their mouths.","title":"Justice Thomas Did Not Disclose Additional Trips, Democrats Say"},{"text":"He can still write","title":"Biden Signs Funding Bill to Avert Government Shutdown"},{"text":"The link talks about the bad faith strategies that have been used to intentionally disrupt the operation of popular government services they wouldn't be able to get elected to shut down.Conservatives lie and cheat in service to their oligarch masters.
