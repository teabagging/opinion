That was a misdemeanor until crooked Alvin Bragg upgraded the charges to felony level after seeing that the legal precedent gives him the opportunity to jail Trump and convict him as a felon to keep him out of the White House (how did that work?) I agree that extramarital affairs are bad but i doubt Donald Trump himself filed that paperwork or advised somebody to lie about. If you disagree thats ok but imo this case was handled unfairly and if anyone else oversaw it then it would have been a misdemeanor charge if not dismissed. He has not been convicted of stealing classified documents or anything related to the January 6th attack on our capital.

This bill has nothing to do with due process. It doesn't change the process of removing non-profit status at all. The process today is as follows: the IRS finds evidence that a non-profit is violating the law. The IRS notifies the non-profit that it plans to strip non-profit status if the law-breaking activity doesn't cease. The non-profit can file an internal appeal within the IRS, and there's an extensive review process. If that review does not change the original findings of the IRS, the non-profit can sue the IRS in federal court to maintain its non-profit status.The bill in question does not change that process. It gives the IRS access to state department and classified information, information which *would be shared in court* if the non-profit sues the IRS.Again, I need to emphasize that an organization does not need to be charged with a crime in order to be stripped of non-profit status. This has *always* been an administrative process. No prosecutors involved. If an organization doesn't like the outcome of the administrative process, they sue in federal court.","title":"Full List of Democrats Who Voted for Bill That Gives Trump Admin More Power"},{"text":"Yes, but I'm stupid and make bad decisions.I expected better from the rest of you.","title":"Ukraine blows up Kurakhove Dam in false flag demolition."},{"text":"And I've reported multiple posts literally showing hate and only gotten back automated messages from reddit that say \\"this doesn't violate our rules\\"","title":"I got a 3 day ban for a comment I made in this sub."},{"text":"I thankfully been divorced from reality for a while.

One of the problems for Democrats in trying to make positive changes from the federal level also helps in the other direction preventing Republicans from being able to pull off worst case scenarios.

[This video shared here](https://youtu.be/g9UKnU3dRDM) a couple of days ago seems to give a fair take on it all. Now, assuming democracy remains intact and trends continue as they have (over the past 15 years, not this recent election), we're likely to regain the House in 2026 and possibly pick up seats in the senate though maybe not majority. It's unlikely the economy will be doing great with lower prices everywhere so all the people voting simply for that reason and not all the right wing stuff will swing back to voting for Democrats in 2028, hopefully.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 12, 2024"},{"text":"\\"They told us 100% that she was going to win...I had someone high up...he told me that we were gonna win Iowa...And I said 'Are you sure?' and he just smirked.\\"","title":"Senior DNC Employee Emotionally Criticizes Harris Spending - Hints Biden Sabotaged Open Primary with Quick Endorsement"},{"text":"Class welcomes trash.","title":"Welcome back: Biden offers Trump the smooth transition he never got as president-elect returns to the White House"},{"text":"If a the electorate of a democracy votes itself into losing its own democracy, I really dont know if theres anything you can really do at that point.","title":"Welcome back: Biden offers Trump the smooth transition he never got as president-elect returns to the White House"},{"text":"Ackshully, progressives are probably the most reliable voting bloc for Democrats based on Pew Researchs data.

He told reporter David Harrison of?*The Telegraph*?that he had just returned to a petrochemical complex in the city of Yanbu after a holiday when 9/11 occurred.  \\nOn Sept. 14, 2001, CNN had released the name of Mosear Caned, who they said was expected to be on a list of hijackers being released later that day. Instead, that name disappeared and was replaced by Hani Hanjour. But where did the first name come from? And if Hanjour purchased a ticket, then why wasnt his name on the original list? On top of that, an ATM photo of Hanjour, taken six days before 9/11, does not resemble the Hanjour shown in the Dulles video.\\\\[9\\\\]  \\nWe know for a fact that the official (but unauthenticated ) passenger list from Flight 77 is not the same as the original one. We know that because the Counsel for American Airlines, in a 2004 letter to the 9/11 Commission, stated that they dont know if Hanjour checked in at the main ticket counter. On Sept. 16, 2001, the?*Washington Post*?reported that Hanjours name was not on the original manifest because he may not have purchased a ticket. But his name appears on the list entered into evidence at the Zacarias Moussaoui trial.\\\\[10\\\\]  \\nAlso, the spelling of the names of the other four were changed slightly from the first list: Cammid Al-Madar became Khalid Al-Mihdhar; Majar Mokhed became Majed Moqed; Salem Al-Hazni became Salem Al-Hazmi; and Nawar Al-Hazni became Nawaf Al-Hazmi.  \\n**Flight 175:**?The list originally contained four names but a fifth, Mohand al-Sheri, was added later. But he turned up alive and living in Saudi Arabia, according to the Saudi embassy in Washington. Hamza al-Gamdi was supposed to have been a hijacker on Flight 175, but his family came forward to state that the photo released did not resemble him although the name and birth date matched.  \\n**Flight 93:**?Another who turned up alive was Saeed al-Ghamdi. He told David Harrison of?*The Telegraph*?that he was shocked to see his name on the list of hijackers and that he had spent the previous 10 months in Tunis learning to fly an Airbus. According to the BBC, al-Ghamdi had also been interviewed by the London-based Arab newspaper?*Asharq Al Awsat*.  \\nAnother alleged hijacker, Ahmed al-Nami, told Harrison after 9/11 that he was shocked to see his name on the list of hijackers, adding that, I had never even heard of Pennsylvania. He stated that he had been working as an administrative supervisor for Saudi Arabian Airlines.  \\nPhotographic evidence shows that the Ziad Jarrah accused of being a hijacker is not the same person whose half burned photo was supposedly found at the crash site in Shanksville, PA. Kolar contends that Jarrah had a double as did several others accused of being part of the plot. He says there are accounts of Jarrahs whereabouts that have him in more than one place at a time.  \\nKolar writes that investigators found that Jarrah had spent three months in an al-Qaeda training camp in January 2001. But according to Florida Flight Training Center, Jarrah was a student there until Jan. 15. Jarrah later went to Lebanon Jan. 26-30 to be with his father, who was having open-heart surgery.\\\\[11\\\\]","title":"To believe the official story of 9/11 you have to swallow an awful lot.

But keep in mind that the Treasury already has the ability to dock non-profit status from these organizations if they suspect illegal activity. That's not new. What this bill does is enable the sharing of information (particularly classified information) between departments. That *will* result in more non-profits being flagged, I have no doubt. But why are they being flagged? Let's be real, a lot of these aid organizations need to bribe foreign terrorists in order to operate in conflict zones. They need to bribe Hamas to operate in Gaza, as an example. The CIA knows that these bribes take place, but they can't share information with the IRS. This bill would change that.So if we want to get down to brass tax, the real moral quandary is this: is it okay for American non-profits to bribe terrorists in order to disperse aid in conflict zones? I don't think that's an easy question to answer. Non-profits are against this bill because they feel the bribes are worth it, obviously. That's a valid opinion, IMO.this bill removes necessary red tape and safeguards and throws them into court with less means to defend themselves than through current procedure.No, it doesn't do that.

Meanwhile, the Secretary can strip the status and they don't have to even provide a reason. Pray tell, what is the consequence to the Secretary is they repeatedly strip the status and keep the org in a perpetual legal battle?So if you read the bill, the secretary must provide a specific list of groups being supplied and give the domestic non-profit/NGO the opportunity to cut off aid to those groups. And if they cease aid, then they could maintain their non-profit status.You're correct that it would make sending aid to conflict zones more complicated and less efficient, but I don't think it would end aid altogether.

According to the FBI this is because they could not be sure of their identities. But in several cases, DNA samples could have been collected for comparison to the supposed remains.

Instead, there are only two videos that show any alleged hijackers at any airports on 9/11. These are examined by the 9/11 Consensus Panel in their [Point Video-1: The Alleged Security Videos of Mohamed Atta during a Mysterious Trip to Portland, Maine, September 10-11, 2001](http://www.consensus911.org/point-video-1/) and [Point Video-2: Was the Airport Video of the Alleged AA 77 Hijackers Authentic?](http://www.consensus911.org/point-video-2/)  \\nOne video allegedly shows Mohamed Atta and Abdulaziz al-Omari going through security at the airport in Portland, Maine early on the morning of Sept. 11. This video was released to the press soon after 9/11. Atta and al-Omari were purported to have rented a car and driven from Boston to Portland on Sept. 10. They allegedly appeared on security video at a gas station and a Walmart that day.  \\nIn the case of Portland Airport video, not one but two times were stamped on the images C 5:45 a.m. and 5:53 a.m. The latter time is just seven minutes before the planes scheduled take-off. The trip itself makes no sense given that the two would have been taking a huge the risk that their early morning flight would be delayed, which would have kept them from making their Boston connection. Had this happened, the entire operation could have been compromised.  \\nThe second video, not released until 2004, is of much lower quality. It purports to show the five alleged hijackers of Flight 77 C Hani Hanjour, Nawaf al-Hazmi, Salem al-Hazmi, Khalid al-Mihdhar, and Majed Moqed C passing through a security checkpoint prior to boarding Flight 77 at Washingtons Dulles International Airport.  \\nBut unlike all other video from Dulles surveillance cameras, this does not feature any camera identification number (which would establish where the video was shot) or any time stamp. It is therefore impossible to establish where or when this video was shot, which means it is useless as evidence of whether these five boarded Flight 77.  \\nOn top of this, two of the alleged hijackers who were shown in the dubious video and who were supposed to have boarded Flight 77, Salem al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Midhhar, turned up alive after 9/11. Also damning is that at one point the video (as it was aired on CBS and Court TV) zooms in on al-Mihdhar and pans with him, which suggests human intervention that would not be found on any other airport surveillance video.\\\\[5\\\\]","title":"To believe the official story of 9/11 you have to swallow an awful lot.

The head of his department, a professor of post-modern literature, spoke up and said nothing has changed since then in the brutal treatment of women.

And the collection of knives and box cutters that they allegedly used to take over the planes were somehow not detected?either by electronic screening or through individual searches.  \\nThere were a couple of instances where airport staff did say they believe they saw one or more of the accused hijackers, but these did not stand up because of serious factual contradictions. These included wrong physical descriptions, incorrect descriptions of the types of clothes the men were wearing or whether they wore glasses, and in one case an airport employee said he believed he recognized one of the men from a photo who he said boarded one of the American Airlines planes.

The 9/11 Commission says it received copies of electronic boarding passes for Flight 93.  \\nAs Davidsson reports, there is one story recounted in Tom Murphys book?*Regaining the Sky*?that appears nowhere else: Terry Rizzuto, the United Airlines station manager at Newark Airport (where Flight 93 left from), had just finished arranging to release to the FBI the manifest and the Passenger Name Record from Flight 93. She headed to the gate that the plane had left from to speak with staff, and when she arrived, she was handed four boarding passes by an unnamed supervisor, who tells her that they are for the four alleged hijackers of the flight.  \\nWhen she asked how they found this out so fast, the supervisor replied: They were too well dressed.

The official flight manifests are legal documents that are used to establish the identities of passengers when, for example, insurance claims are being made.  \\nDavidsson requested these official manifests from American Airlines in 2004, but the request was denied. An airline spokesperson stated that the official lists had been turned over to the FBI and that they had in turn released a list of names to the media, adding that the airline is not in a position to release further information or to republish what the government agencies provided to the media.\\\\[3\\\\] He made another attempt in 2005 and was given a list of 53 passengers with the names of the alleged hijackers redacted. When he approached United Airlines, he was told to contact the FBI.  \\nDavidsson made a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the FBI for the original passenger manifests?and was told that the lists were available on the Internet and at the U.S. Department of Justice web site. But all that was available at the site were seating arrangements, not a passenger list.  \\nPerhaps the biggest problem with the passenger lists that have been released is that the identities of several of the alleged hijackers have changed with no explanation. We also know that several of the people on the FBIs list were still alive after 9/11 and could not have been part of any possible hijackings. Some names were deleted and others substituted, but even some of the new names belonged to people who turned out to be alive. Kolar reports that at least 10 of the current list of 19 were still alive after 9/11.\\\\[4\\\\]  \\nIn his book, Davidsson points out that former Drug Enforcement Agency administrator and former Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Robert Bonner, testified before the 9/11 Commission that he had been handed a sheet containing the names of the 19 probable hijackers by 11 a.m. on 9/11. The problem is that this is well before the U.S. military had even confirmed which planes had been hijacked. Where did he get this list?  \\nIn 2012, Davidsson made another FOIA request to the FBI asking for flight manifests for hijacked flights. This was denied even though the names of the hijackers and the passengers had been publicly known for years. He concludes from his research that either the FBI does not possess the original flight manifests or those lists do not reflect the current list of alleged hijackers.","title":"To believe the official story of 9/11 you have to swallow an awful lot.

Only 37.9% Americans have a college degree in 2021. Also, fresh graduates without an experience outside the academic world don't know how to negotiate with people in society. In particular, those people drafting the speech/scripts are primarily from social science or humanity majors which are notorious for overusing academic niche jargons and a boast of doing it. A culture that has an built-in arrogance towards the mass. But the mass decides election outcomes. Dems should immediately stop the dominance of college or grad-school educated intellectuals on their messages. They should be included but not the dominant rhetoric, nor suppressing other people from inventing the more effective ones.? ??\\nAs a grad-school educated person myself, I think all the liberals should deeply reflect on our approach when talking to other people. Because they form their impression not only from the formal channels of the Dem party, but also from us. Turn to approaches that everyone would resonate with - the grandma approach sounds perfect. People in Taiwan managed to persuade most of their moms and dads to accept same sex marriage. It is via things like \\"your daughter really feels more happy/less unhappy if she can live her way. She will be miserable if she has to live a life that other people design for her. She'll be okay on her own and she loves you. \\" Instead of \\"You homophobic transphobic piece of sxxt\\". Stop, immediately, using any ways communication that doesn't make sense emotionally.?\\nOn the other hand, liberals/Dems should NOT be on the defensive only. Both parties have their extreme wing, particularly them because they have religious zealot agenda like banning condom and alcohol and porn. Voice that out loudly.

He did say that, but it's not what he actually did, which was ban 7 countries predominantly Muslim from entering, those countries had to meet specific criteria to enter. He clarified his statement later on which is in alignment with the executive order he made3. Obama did the same thing as Trump in terms of the children they were first placed in detention centers (of which they ran out of space due to the quantity of immigrants leading to children in cages pictures which circulated under both Obama and Trump, although under Obama the number of children sepersted was miniscule vs. 2700 under trump) after being processed they were placed in the foster system, they weren't held there indefinitely and only in such conditions because they ran out of space4. This specific case I'm split, it depends on if he truly believes they were wrongfully exonerated, he to this day says he still believes they are guilty.

The Obama *coalition* - i.e. his voters - was built on (a) his charisma and political acumen, (b) his economically leftish/populistish and socially moderate policies - both actual and perceived - and (c) his grassroots campaign. Thats how he got elected both times. The Obama *machine*, i.e. the network of consultants, nonprofits, etc. largely took shape *after* he got elected and was very much focused on shaping policy and normatively shaping public opinion, in addition to nominally trying to win elections. Naturally, this machine was largely operated by progressive activists and political elites. Voters did not where the machine was taking the party, but Obama was skilled enough to hold on in 2012. After 2016, we no longer had a charismatic leader and people were getting tired of the machine, which made Dems look too establishment and elite without Obama as the figurehead. By 2024 (at the latest), the tail was wagging the dog - the machine was no longer a useful tool of the party leader, but akin to an AI bot anointing leaders to do its bidding. The machine still had item (c), but had completely lost site of (a) and (b), which is not nearly enough to win a presidential election. So what to do? The machine doesnt need to be put down, but it does need to be put in its place as a tool of (hopefully charismatic) leaders who are in tune with what the public actually wants.

He was born into immense wealth and has taken credit for other people's work his entire life. He needs the government to see him as a top ally, and Trump wants to be Elon Musk so bad he can hardly stand it, so it is a win-win for him. The more loyalty he shows for Trump, the more money is going into his pocket. He does not care what happens to anyone else in America as long as he is getting money. So, he will peddle bullshit to get Trump on his side, have Trump hand him billions in kickbacks and contracts for his support, and continue to amass wealth.  \\nOn the other hand, you have common sense telling you that undocumented people cannot vote, anywhere. Even if they become citizens, there is no guarantee they are going to vote Democrat. You need to look at motivation of argument before you start asking if something is true or not.Now, are the Republicans trying to grow more supporters? Absolutely they are. That is why they make all the high school kids pray before football games, reinforce God in everything they touch, want to open the doors to school vouchers and get kids into private schools as fast as they can. The fastest way to do this is to deny women the right to an abortion, stop paying for birth control, and force them to have as many babies as possible. This will lead to a huge following of conservative principles because all those children will be brought up in this environment.School vouchers are a great weapon against the poor and minority students because private schools do not have to take anyone they do not want, or cannot pass their entrance exam, or are not a legacy student. They get the money from the state, but no the students they do not want.Invariably, the public schools become overwhelmingly minority with little to no money for funding to keep good teachers and administrators in the schools. These schools fail over and over when they lose the money and the government gets to come in and close those schools down, forcing those attending into terrible private schools or they end up dropping out and the positive outcomes for those kids is not good.This is already ongoing in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and other states in the South. School vouchers are next and the final pin in their plan will be complete. All they have to do is sit back and watch it happen.To date, over 26,000 women and girls have had to have their SA's child because of the lack of abortion care. We have had multiple women die as a result of these laws.

Obviously there are people in neoliberal chapters, obviously they are real, and I'd bet they have noticeable personality differences to people who just post, because these are people motivated and social enough to be in chapters. But at the same time, the amount of people in a chapter vs the amount of people who are neoliberals online is a rounding error, and the chapters are all downstream of online anyway and so are there concerns and methods. When the irl component is so tiny compared to the online, is downstream of the online, and is essentially just an extension of the online, then the online becomes the primary, and the offline becomes the irrelevant little sidequest until it can do better.I have been less personally involved in this area in the past, but I have watched from afar (or sometimes closer sidelines) as IRL leftists groups definitely imploded under totally predictable and reliable infighting, and the way that different progressive advocacy groups reliably start acting in accordance with exactly whatever was decided in online leftist discourse a couple of years ago (not to even get into whatever the fuck goes into regional DSA disputes), and import the norms of how to interact and relate to specific issues from leftist spaces. Like does that need to be proven too? It takes a bit more legwork, but it follows pretty naturally from how strict the social norms in leftist spaces are. Every now and then in leftist spaces you did get someone who said \\"God you people care so much about dumb shit, join an irl org or something\\" and there were like... 1 of these people, for every 130,000 of everyone else, and then those 1 people were generally in a small group that when you looked it up had broken up a few years after.Like, I just don't buy that the IRL Leftists are heavily divorced from the norms and practices of the online leftists unless they're much older or not actually leftists. I don't even think that passes the sniff test, and with enough time and googling and connecting dots, I think it can be proven false. It's not even particularly insightful since you've just outright abandoned the original definition.That original definition was already abandoned by leftist spaces in the first place, but again, I think this applies to *all* political ideologies that they should *all* be understood first and foremost as subcultures before they're understood by their beliefs, because their beliefs and values will be downstream of how the subculture is organized. I know you're saying you're a socialist. That doesn't matter. Pretty much every single thing I think is based on the idea that politics is about social systems, and that everything else is subordinate to this, so the fact that you're saying \\"I'm a socialist\\" doesn't matter because you've told me that you're not part of the subculture I'm identifying. It doesn't matter that your beliefs would be formally technically leftist beliefs under any sensible pre-2010 definition.It was leftist spaces that made the meaning of the pre-existing term much more based in vibes than any commitment to a particular type of theory beyond anti-capitalism. When everything I talk about is social spaces and how they relate to politics, and then I make it clear that \\"In this context, I'm using this word to mean this\\", it's useless to say \\"But actually the word means that\\". It'd be one thing if I didn't establish what I'm doing with the word, but I have, over and over, and so I simply don't care when you say \\"But actually, it means this\\". You know the type of leftists and leftism I've defined exist, and I'd be shocked if you think you can say honestly that they don't vastly outnumber useful IRL leftists, and so just as conservatives should be defined by normal conservatives and liberals defined by normal liberals as opposed to the useful activists from both groups, the same obviously applies to leftists - and again, in all cases, the useful activists from both groups are always in some way downstream from the main group.","title":"Social Systems win Culture Wars - here's how liberals and you (you personally!) can win the next one."},{"text":"We will bro.

We have offered up some of our own. On Monday, Rolling Stone spoke with Michael Podhorzer, former longtime political director for the AFL-CIO, the nations largest federation of unions, to gain more insight into what went so wrong for Democrats.Podhorzer, who chairs the Analyst Institute and is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, is an expert in data-driven politics. In a blog post Monday, he writes that the election results were not about Americans embracing Trumpism  but rather a continuation of a trend in U.S. politics: Elections are consistently change elections, because Americans are simply fed up with the system not working for them. That was the case before the Covid era  and even more so now.Further, he says, the election was no MAGA mandate: If the exit polls are roughly accurate, about 19 million people who had voted for \\\\[Joe\\\\] Biden in 2020 just stayed home, Podhorzer writes. And, again, if the exits are roughly accurate, nearly all of those who stayed home had said they were voting against Trump when they cast ballots in 2020.In our conversation, Podhorzer suggests the 2024 election results were in part about media coverage that didnt capture Trumps threat, as well as Americans discontent with an economic system and job market that are more precarious than ever  with neither major political party interested in solving those issues.Rather than ask what Democrats can do to win back working-class voters, Podhozer says the better question is: What do working people have to do to get a Democratic Party? The other related and necessary collective project, he says, is taking on a Supreme Court that has deemed itself Washingtons only actual functioning legislative body, and has fundamentally rewritten the rules of our democracy.Read more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/harris-trump-biden-why-democratic-turnout-cratered-1235164354/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/harris-trump-biden-why-democratic-turnout-cratered-1235164354/)","title":"Why Democratic Turnout Cratered  And Why It Wont Be Easy to Fix"},{"text":"Why are people here now so suddenly against Pete 2028??

The fear and shame piece I'm talking about is specifically in regards to Gaza, where there was no other message. The empty 'pressing for a ceasefire' message was useless because it's shown again and again to be either a lie or a massive failure that they would take no actions to change.  They got that lie, and 'the other guy will be worse, and how dare you not vote for us'. The other guy was at least giving a lie that hadn't been proven to be so. THAT is where the 99% piece came from. We KNOW Harris would do nothing different. Trump keeps saying he'll end it. So desperate people cling to any sliver of hope they have. The 99% comment wasn't trying to be Persuasive, so don't try and fucking put it on me that I was advocating for Trump in any sense, it's giving an idea on the thought process on why someone would vote for Trump over Harris in regards to Gaza. There was no 'persuadable politician' on this issue, Harris showed that again and again. Biden set that path and she ran with it the entire way.You're angry. So am I. But stop putting the blame at the wrong fucking place (this is a general statement for the messaging and thread at large, not directly at you). Hold the politicians who run shitty campaigns to task, not marginalized people who are just trying to survive. Get rid of the assholes who ran this horrible campaign and kept pushing for it to be like this or even More right-wing.

Often the center is antithetical to the left, but that's the art of being a successful politician IMo, to bridge things that do not often can be bridged. I have often called myself an Obama Democrat, i.e, it's his administration that I could only ever vote without much thought, because Obama could pull this balancing act, and yes he was very flawed himself, but it didn't matter as much because he was a unifying force.You don't need the hardcore conservatives, you honestly don't.  Let them vote red until the end of their natural life, it doesn't matter. It's their right too. It's the center you care about.

People *want* to question the powers that are, as long as the criticism is valid. Take Jon Stwart during the Bush years. It was the \\"talk truth to power\\" that people yearning for.

Everyone's got blindspots in their mind, and you're witnessing a lot of like-minded folks who have the same bunch of blindspots.","title":"Are Democrats Controlled Opposition?"},{"text":"1. Let's go through the quote: \\"*When Mexico sends its people, theyre not sending their best. \\\\[\\\\] Theyre sending people that have lots of problems, and theyre bringing those problems with us. Theyre bringing drugs. Theyre bringing crime. Theyre rapists. And some, I assume, are good people (Time Magazine 2015)*\\". The implication here is that these people aren't fleeing to the US on their own, they're being sent by Mexico. He's not saying many or most, he's just generally saying that they're bringing drugs and crime and that they're rapists. Then at the very end he assumes that some of them are good people. If I say cats are fast, but some are slow, then I have said a general statement about cats with an exception for a minority of them. That's what Trump is doing here, generalizing that *most* mexican refugees are criminals and rapists.\\n2. Trump did call for a ban of all muslims entering the US. His exact words were: ?\\"*a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.*\\" (NPR, 2015). For legal reasons the actual ban couldn't target muslims in general, as that would be unconstitutional, so he focused on a series of countries instead, but his stated intent was to ban muslims from entering the US. My argument is that Trump is a racist and a neo-nazi, and if he wants to ban all muslims but only partially succeeds, that's not a repudiation of that argument.\\n3. Previous administrations have also deported people, but they never had a specific policy to separate families. There were no detention centers for migrant children in any previous administration, this only happened under Trump. When criminals go to prison, generally there's another parent to care for the child. If there isn't, there is usually other family. In extreme cases children are placed with the state or a foster home. We usually don't put the kids in cages, no matter what their parents do.\\n4. The point again is that Trump is a racist. His unwillingness to admit he was wrong in calling for the execution of the exonerated five is one more racist box ticked off on the diagnostic chart. \\n5. It's not quite true that they didn't have to admit guilt. Part of the settlement was that the Trump business had to promise to stop discriminating against people of color. Again, if the argument is that Trump is not a racist, it sure seems odd that he keeps doing and saying racist things. Like this little nugget from his casino days: *When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor, a former employee of Trumps Castle, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, told a writer for the New Yorker*\\" (The Atlantic, 2019).\\n6. Yep. He quoted Hitler and Mussolini. The Hitler quote isn't just some historical quote though, he's quoting the sentiment of Hitler's ideology. Ask yourself what it means to poison the blood of a country? Why choose that quote in the context of talking about immigrants in the US? If he's speaking literally, he's talking about diluting / ruining the genetics of the white race. If he's speaking figuratively, he's still talking about diluting the racial composition of America. In either case it's a clear and obvious neo-nazi talking point. It's no accident that he quotes Hitler in this context.\\n7. I'm sure if you google \\"unified reich\\" and \\"Truth social\\" you can find your way to some information without having to make a Truth Social account.","title":"For these Hindu Americans, a pivot from the Democratic Party was long overdue"},{"text":"Well, maybe not quite.  Lets look at what voters actually decided and the opportunities we were given to voice our preferences. When did we, as voters, have the chance to truly support Kamala Harris for president? In the 2020 Democratic primary, Kamala entered the race early but dropped out by December 3, 2019, due to low polling and a lack of donor support. Her campaign never gained substantial momentum, and she received little direct support from voters in those early primaries. In other words, there was never a real groundswell of public support for her.And then we have Bidenhe formally announced his candidacy on April 25, 2019, but kept a low profile until after Harris and other candidates exited. The early primary debates barely gave voters time to get to know Harris, and by the time Super Tuesday rolled around, Biden had quickly consolidated support from key party figures. The race was effectively over before many voters even had a chance to weigh in on alternatives.In 2024, Biden again stayed in the race much longer than expected, stepping aside too late for Harrisor any candidateto introduce themselves to the American public in a meaningful way. Dont get me wrongI voted for Harris and genuinely wanted her to win. But she didnt have the time to connect with voters, and that feels like a deliberate strategy by the Democratic Party to avoid offering a real choice for change, instead handing power to billionaires while framing it as the best option.This wasnt a voter issue; it was a controlled narrative. The choices we were presented with were shaped by party dynamics and timing that left little room for genuine public input, creating the illusion of choice while keeping real reform off the table.","title":"Betrayed by Design: How the Democratic Party Handed Us Over to the Billionaires"},{"text":"I think they've accepted losing the presidency and Senate, but are going to fight, cheat and steal the House as hard as they can .","title":"Don't be fooled: Democrats didn't \\"concede\\" the 2016 election, and they might not really be \\"conceding\\" this one either"},{"text":"Off the top of my head:  Because Trump's entire administration is focused on hurting these people, not on due process or on anything resembling human rights?","title":"Why would migrants be more afraid of deportation under Trump when Joe Biden deported more migrants than Trump?"},{"text":"I was kinda afraid of that, thats why I asked for the dates.

Demanding accountability from the 4th estate was a lost cause *before* the election, with the acceptance of the \\"fake news = anything I disagree with\\" narrative, and there's zero chance for systemic improvement anytime in the near future. You can't counter-message the propaganda machine when people actively refuse to listen or challenge the accepted narrative. The information is readily available, at our fingertips in a heartbeat, explained at every comprehension level and attention span. It's not a question of access, it's a matter of choice (and time, and energy, and standards). 40 years ago, if you wanted to know what's going on in the world, you could watch national news, local news, catch the radio updates, or read the paper. You could listen or skim to the parts that interested you the most, but you would inevitably be exposed to stories, opinions, and topics that were outside of your preferences or opposed to your point of view.

Like I explained that in the reply that I left to you and you assumedly didn't read. So I'll explain it again.The reason that exploiting the race part would be powerful is because most leftists only learn about minority groupsHere I'm referring to the post I wrote, where \\"exploiting the race part\\" refers to showing the difference between what leftists believe minority groups believe on race issues vs what minority groups actually believe. I explained that's what it meant in the post you're replying to as well.  Mhm, so you're talking solely about a partially imagined, online subculture.I can't lie, this sincerely makes me Mad Online. This is the most frustrating part of this - this is a 0% imagined subculture. I was *there*. I saw it *everywhere*. It is 100% real. Do you doubt that there is a significant subculture online that calls themselves leftists? Do you doubt that they have a significant, in fact overwhelming and decisive influence on everything that could be considered far left? If I show you tons of popular posts about leftist things that explicitly call out leftists, and invite other people who are leftists to discuss leftist issues, and refer to other types of ambient discourse in leftist spaces, would that sufficiently prove leftists exist? What about if I then show very popular leftist content creators who call themselves leftists and their communities consider themselves leftists? Would the existence of leftist memes about leftist issues, specifically calling about being leftist as a unique political subculture that has pre-existing discourse to refer to, prove that leftists is a thing? The reality is, yes, if you say \\"I am not a part of this subculture\\", then you're not in it and I wouldn't group you into it.

I do mean to say that leftists would sit around and post instead of taking action. It's the nature of the scene. There are a lot of reasons why the way leftist spaces are set up would naturally lead to this type of non-action by default, but I probably shouldn't even bother explaining the mechanics of it if you can't even accept the premise that \\"leftists exist\\" in the first place and I'd have to prove that instead.","title":"Social Systems win Culture Wars - here's how liberals and you (you personally!) can win the next one."},{"text":"Remember John Tower?\\nHe could not get confirmed as Bush sr.'s defense secretary because apparently he liked a drink now and then.

So no, the secretary would not have the unchecked power to designate any non-profit as a supporter of terrorism without providing any evidence. That's just straight up wrong. The designation would be subject to IRS internal review and any court challenges, and it would have to meet the specific standards set out in the bill.There are people in this thread who are talking about the ACLU being designated a terrorist organization based on the headline and text of this article, and that's not how this bill would have worked.","title":"Full List of Democrats Who Voted for Bill That Gives Trump Admin More Power"},{"text":"Never thought of it like that, looking at the Russia blaming though I'm from the UK and there was a spy killed with novichok, wondering if the culprit was closer to home now","title":"Ukraine blows up Kurakhove Dam in false flag demolition."},{"text":"I don't think Biden could arrest anyone, even if it was his job.","title":"Biden/Trump White House meeting revives presidential tradition Trump skipped 4 years ago"},{"text":" some policy from the previous administration was responsibleHow about Woodrow Wilson signing Federal Reserve Act and giving control of issuing money to private bankers while paying interest for the privilege?","title":"Trump will bring about the Great Reset"},{"text":"The embrace of lying also has squarely pointed out how ignorant most Americans are.

There are things such as MGTOW specifically for frustrated men who think the dating game is stacked against them and refuse to date. There are also asexuals who physically dont feel any sexual or even dating attraction to begin with. This isnt anything new and people have a right to do what they want for every part dating wise, and that should be respected. On your four points1. Thats not really what conservative men want. Conservative men want to date, marry, and then have untold amounts of children without any use of birth control, regardless of the risks. They dont want to be celibate for life. 2. I dont think beyond reddit this whole you dont date someone on the opposite political spectrum is really a thing. I grew up in a politically split household, and its not that uncommon. Sure whenever politics come up it can get a little heated, always with a sense of love and respect under the surface, but low and behold politics isnt generally the most important thing in most peoples lives. 3. I dont know where you heard that, but Conservatives want more people on the planet, regardless of political affiliation. They just have rules regarding relationships that liberal men dont have. 4. Liberal men arent immune from the problems these women are talking about. Liberal men still rape, beat their wives, murder women, pressure women into children, dont support their woman if they have a child(in some ways they are less likely to support them than conservative men), etc. This isnt a conservative man vs liberal men thing, this is a men in general thing.\\nOverall your argument stands on a false premise that conservative men want women to be celibate, which they dont. Most women, despite their problems with men and the society around them, arent actively trying to be celibate, because ewmen(if that were the case most women would not be straight). A lot of them feel forced into it because of the lack of support systems and safety nets given by the government, both financial and now health wise with the new insane abortion laws that actively harm women, even if they chose to have a baby, and the lack of effort a lot of men put into these relationships, as theyre not the ones directly suffering from the consequences of say a broken condom or a bad birth control pill.","title":"CMV: Sex Strikes and the General 4B movement is ineffective.

Its too much! Ive viewed Dems as corrupt for a while now, supporting and pushing the pharmaceutical industry, allowing lobbyists to distract from whats beneficial to working people, Jesus and the disgusting aid to Israel, assisting them in their clearly stated goal of eradicating an entire ethnicity of people? Dems dont care about the people.. only themselves and their pockets And with all the gender studies majors preaching, many working class people actually believe college is a scam and brain washes people. With big corps jumping in to the woke stuff, working people feel like they are not being represented at all. You can have a loud minority on TikTok shouting at people for this and that. But the majority of people  simply do not care, and yet the wokeness is shoved in their faces everywhere. They see corporations and democrats as coastal college educated elites that will never understand them. So when Trump comes along and validates all their feelings. I mean how are people surprised he won. Dems  the party  need to listen to Bernie.

Bush a nazi, or George H. W. Bush or Reagan or any other Republican president a nazi. I disagreed with those people politically, but I had no cause to think that they were motivated by a hateful and racist ideology.Trump on the other hand fits the term well. He is deeply motivated by racism. This list is too long to state in its entirety, so I'll just list some of the more well known incidents here:1. Trump started his first campaign by saying that latin-american refugees are rapists and murderers. \\n2. Then he wanted to ban an entire religion from entering the country with his muslim-ban. \\n3. His administration put immigrant and refugee children and toddlers in cages without their parents. More than 5.500 chilidren, some as young as infants, were separated from their families.\\n4. He called for the execution of five black young men for a crime they didn't commit. When they were exonerated he refused to admit that they were innocent, and refused to apologize for having taken out a full-page newspaper ad calling for their execution.\\n5. When he was a landlord in New York in the 70's he and his business discriminated against black tenants, writing a \\"C\\" on their tenant applications for \\"colored\\", and then refusing to rent to them. The justice department sued Donald Trump, his dad and his business, and they settled the case.\\n6. He quotes Hitler in his speeches, using rhetoric like \\"immigrants are poisoning the blood of our country\\". He often talks about how he thinks he has superior genes.\\n7. He re-posted a video to his Truth social account that called for the creation of a \\"unified Reich\\" in America.I could go on for days. Trump may not be a swastika-wearing Nazi, and he hasn't started gassing millions of people (yet), but he's motivated by the same hateful ideology, he has the same belief in the superiority of the white race, and he discriminates against minorities and people of color. The term neo-nazi is a fitting one for Donald Trump.","title":"For these Hindu Americans, a pivot from the Democratic Party was long overdue"},{"text":"Why the fuck not?","title":"Kamala Harriss former communications director has suggested Biden steps down of office to make Kamala the first woman president"},{"text":"How is that an incredible insight?

Both have a random identifier printed on them (that identifies the ballot, not the voter). You look at both, make sure they match each other and how you want to vote. One copy goes in the ballot box, one copy goes on [one of these ticket wheels](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/choice-stainless-steel-order-wheel-ticket-holder-16-clips-with-pedestal-base/176CHKWHL16.html). The poll worker gives the wheel a spin, pulls one off, and gives it to you to take home. You don't know whose ballot you got, but it's probably not yours.After the polls close, all the ballots are posted online. You can look at all of them and verify vote totals. You can also search for the unique identifier on the ballot you were allowed to take home and verify that it was counted correctly. If it wasn't, you can raise an issue and get an investigation started.Because you don't get to take your ballot, you can't prove how you voted to someone who may have tried to buy your vote or intimidate you. Because all votes are online, anyone can count the results themselves. Because everyone can verify an individual ballot against the paper copy that the original voter verified, the integrity of the online results can be checked collectively and issues raised if they're incorrect on any significant scale.","title":"CMV: The only way to ensure there was no election fraud is to have all votes publicly listed"},{"text":"As long as Biden orders it, its an official act.

The portion of the planned Caribbean Sea Tunnel, will span from Miami, Florida to Cap-Haitien in Haiti, a total of 600 miles of tunnel which will float 75 meters under the sea held down with adjustable pylons and high tension cords connected to the sea floor. I-95U will feature a rest stop every 50 miles containing fuel stations, food, restrooms and fire/medical/police centers. Everetti police stations will be located every hundred miles which would be used to respond to car accidents and other incidents. Fire/rescue and EMS stations will be located every 50 miles at each rest stop. I-95U will have a speed limit of 75 miles per hour, which will be enforced electronically rather than have police patrols. The tunnel will have three lanes of traffic for both the west bound and east bound sides, totalling six lanes. In addition to the road for cars, there will be three railroad lines, two of which are regular train lines and one will be part of the Maglev system as the Caribbean International Highway Line also called the I-95 Line.I-95U is a concept tunnel as part of a global architecture test for a plan for a global highway that spans the Earth, originally conceived in the 1990s. If the 600 miles tunnel succeeds, it may lead to the planning stages of the global highway system.ConstructionCurrently, 475 miles of the CIH-1 tunnel have been completed, spanning from Miami, Florida to the CIH-1/CIH-2 Interchange point, Cuban Interchange Point and another 300 miles toward Haiti. Construction involves the use of a massive crane barge which carries each of the 660 foot long sections of tunnel and lowers them into the water where they will be locked and sealed in place. Each tunnel section is 660 feet long, 140 feet wide and 25 feet tall, totalling 4,800 tunnel sections to be placed under the water. There are currently four barges working, each carrying two tunnel sections. A total of eight sections are laid a day, totalling one mile in distance added to the tunnel every 24 hours. Tunnel sections are produced and constructed on land in large warehouses. The tunnel floats 75 meters under the sea surface, held down with adjustable pylons and high tension cords connected to the sea floor. The tunnel, pylons and cords adjust to changing tectonics utilizing flexibility between tunnel sections.I-932U\\nFile:CIH-7 I-932U.pngI-932U planned Florida-Yucatan tunnel. Blue represents uncompleted tunnel section while red is completed.Interstate I-932U is a second Everetti owned interstate tunnel route recently approved for construction. I-932U will span from Cancun, Yucatan to a junction with I-95U, north of Cuba. The tunnel will span 400 miles under the Gulf of Mexico. An additional Maglev route has been added to the Miami-Haiti line that will stop at an undersea station in which a Yucatan-Maya Coast line will be installed, spanning from Reynosa, Maya Coast to the I95U-I932U Maglev station located at a rest stop at the I95U-I932U junction. Eight rest stops will exist along I-932U, each containing an emergency rescue and medical, fire, police station, motel rest, fast food and restrooms. I-932U will have a speed limit of 75 miles per hour with six lanes of traffic (three eastbound, three westbound) and three rail lines (one Maglev running from Cancun to the undersea junction) and ? two standard rail lines for cargo, transport and other rail trains.ConstructionConstruction on I-932U began August 9th 2009, starting in Cancun, Yucatan. By late 2011, I-932U will be connected to the already completed I-95U route.Caribbean International HighwayThe Caribbean International Highway is a proposed CARICOM plan to create an underwater tunnel highway connecting several caribbean nations with road routes. CIH-1 is already under construction, the I-95U tunnel stretching from Florida to Haiti. Additional tunnels will connect between nations such as CIH-2, connecting Cuba to I-95U and CIH-3, connecting the Bahamas main island and capitol, Nassau, to the I-95U tunnel. Other routes, CIH-4 will connect Puerto Rico to the Dominican Republic and CIH-5 connecting Haiti to Jamaica with a stop at the U.S. Navassa Islands.On February 28, 2011, Caribbean Route 2, which connects Cuba to the I-95U Caribbean Route 1 was completed, joining the Union of Everetti with Cuba. On March 1st, the tunnel opened to vehicle traffic with an opening ceremony launching the first rail train through to tunnel to Cuba, which carried trade cargo. The first vehicles to pass through the tunnel to Cuba was a Presidential motorcade containing the President of the Union of Everett, Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense who would later meet with Cuban leadership to discuss and negotiate treaties. Following the motorcade, the tunnel opened to vehicle traffic.VenezuelaA part of the CIH proposal is in agreement with Everett's peace treaty with Venezuela. To aid in trade between all Caribbean nations, Venezuela wants a connection to the tunnel system. Everett though did not want to disturb all of the smaller islands along the way, which may damage their ecosystems and clear waters and beaches. A proposed tunnel addition, named CIH-6 would run from Puerto Rico, passing through the Virgin Islands and follow south through all of the smaller Caribbean nations, passing through St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, Montserrat, Guadeloupe, Dominica, Martinique, St. Lucia, St. Vincent &amp; The Grenadines and Grenada into Venezuela. This remains in discussion but would open up trade and tourism for all the affected islands and nations along the tunnel route.","title":"Why did Biden open the floodgates down south?"},{"text":"Poland or baltics Im assuming?

Over the past year, Madrid has taken the lead on efforts to help boost development and alleviate poverty while deepening commercial ties to the continent. Prime Minister Pedro Snchezs government has launched several bilateral and multilateral initiatives as it explores new creative ideas ahead of the 4th International Conference on Financing for Development, economy minister Carlos Cuerpo told The Africa Report on the sidelines of last weeks annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington. We are increasingly strengthening our efforts to be present in Africa and make a difference through different channels, Cuerpo said. The first one is to lead at the international level in all these international and multilateral fora, trying to lead these bets for better and more financing for countries in distress, low-income countries. On 24 October, Cuerpo joined World Bank President Ajay Banga to announce an early commitment of 400m ($432m) to the International Development Association (IDA), the banks fund for low-income countries C a 37% increase over the previous replenishment cycle. Banga is calling on IDA donors to raise a record $100bn this year. We would try to follow up on Bangas words that this needs to be the largest replenishment of IDA, and were calling on others to also follow suit, Cuerpo said. **New initiatives** Earlier this year, Spain announced it was channelling 1.5 billion of its Special Drawing Rights (around $2bn), the IMFs reserve assets, to the funds Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) in support of climate policies. Projects in Madagascar and Tanzania will benefit as part of a new cooperation framework between the IMF and World Bank to help countries scale up action to confront the threat of climate change. The country was also the first to include famine among the pause clauses it is adding to its loan deals, which allow developing nations hit by catastrophes such as natural disasters and health crises to suspend debt repayments. Spain is finalising a $19m loan credit to Rwanda that will include these clauses for the financing of a project that promotes the competitiveness of agro-exports by small farmers, according to the economy ministry. Spain also plans to include this clause in a project for the digitalisation of tourism and airport operations in Senegal. On the bilateral front, Spain is launching the Alliance Afrique Avance (Africa Advances Alliance) development initiative in West Africa, initially in Senegal. The main idea is to bring together all the relevant actors, starting with Spanish firms as well as international institutions that have a shared interest, which is local development and the creation of job opportunities, particularly for the youth, Cuerpo said. The idea would be to make a success out of this pilot project and then expand it to others in the region, like, for example, The Gambia. The initiatives are part of a slew of innovative solutions being tested ahead of the UN summit in Seville from 30 June to 3 July 2025. Of course, everything will be leading towards the Fourth International Conference on Financing Development in in Seville next year, said Cuerpo. Were hoping that the conference would be a key stepping stone in debt relief and new financing for development. **Creative solutions** Some of the ideas have required Spain to think outside the box. While individual European countries receive a share of SDRs in line with their IMF quotas C around 9bn ($11.9 bn) in the case of Spain C the European Central Bank requires that these maintain their reserve asset nature and thus only allows re-channelling through the IMF. As a result, Madrid and the rest of the EU capitals cant directly funnel SDRs to multilateral development banks despite new mechanisms that have been developed to allow for such use. Spain pledged to re-channel 50% (4.550bn SDR), most of which have already been converted, and the remaining amount will be before year-end. For us, Euro-area countries, there is no way we can re-channel those directly to the African Development Bank, even through these hybrid instruments, said Cuerpo. This is why we had to find creative ways to do it by working through the IMFs Resilience and Sustainability Trust. We are at this point encouraging other EU area member states to follow our approach, he said. One easy or low-hanging fruit is, of course, the remaining pool of SDRs in the hands of advanced countries. He foresees a new era of Spanish-African relations. Spain is a bridge between the rest of the EU countries and Latin America, but we think that it is high time for Spain to also be engaged with our southern neighbours, Cuerpo said. We are betting on them to be a strategic partner going ahead.!ping IBERIA&amp;AFRICA","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"That's not even remotely true.","title":"US Senate Democrats rush to confirm judges before Trump takes office"},{"text":"\\\\ The BBC faced?**zero**?consequences for getting those girls killed.i've tried multiple google searches and I can't find anything relating to this.

There are many examples of unemployed mercenaries turning on their former employer, or a random party that is just nearby because they need money/supply and have the power (weapons, soldiers, organization) to take it.?\\nIn short, with mercenaries, you create an incentive to go to war.

Personally, I think Trump will be a disaster for the Palestinians, perhaps 25% more than Biden was (note the precision here).This country is unfortunately in the midst of a decline phase and no, Trump may be able to apply a few band aids but not arrest the decline. Money destroyed our political class and destroyed competence in governance.Frankly, if you were to really probe you might find some may be rooting for the global South, led by Russia and China. That IS what's really happening. Everything else is just shadow play.Personally I can't wait till Trump finds out what dire state the economy really is. No amount of drilling for oil will help either. The deeper problem is that, as a country, and as a system, capitalism maxed out on growth. China figured that out long ago which is why it is actually trying to get some prosperity going in under-developed countries, which means new consumers, which means growth. For a few decades more perhaps. Then that'll plateau as well.The reality is that as residents on this planet we have to eventually figure out an economic system that does not require substantial growth and is not dependent on prosperity for the top 20% (at most). Our economists have failed us. Totally.So, this is an opinion for you that's perhaps a bit out of left field, but many agree we are in deep trouble and no Trump can save us. But at least, for the next few years, we can still exchange opinions freely.","title":"Is this sub compromised?"},{"text":"Just Nazis playing a game of let's you and him fight.

This creates a connection between the different populations and more empathy for each other.You also don't have to be in the army in dangerous places.

Many states for instance will have a right to free speech and a right to privacy and there is no clear demarcation of where you draw the line between the two when one person's free speech endangers another person's privacy. This conflict between rights is something each state must navigate by itself.Now compulsory military service certainty seems like it is a curtailment of people's rights. However a right to safety and security is also a right people have even and if you are invaded and occupied by a foreign power you could lose all your rights. It's therefore not a case of condemning compulsory military service but comparing the damage mandatory conscription does to people's rights versus the potential damage from an understaffed military.Mercenary work is generally morally wrong under most frameworks of international law, though not explicitly illegal. War is viewed as a last resort that should be avoided at all costs, with the only justification and legal instances of war being in defence or when approval has been granted by the UN due to a pressing need to intervene. In those cases war is considered sad but necessary.

And all of the money and resources spent on preventing people from crossing would be entirely ineffective against people who cross the border legally but then overstay their visa.

If you really want to know what these policies will do go and look at what happened in Europe. What happened in America as well as we turned away boats full of people trying to flee Germany. There will be real material harm that comes out of Trump's America. Whether we acknowledge it or not the consequences are being written now, history was once the present.

It's really simple - BACK THE CANDIDATE THAT YOU ACTUALLY LIKE. NOT THE ONE WHO IS BLAND AND MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD ENOUGH THAT YOU THINK THEY'RE SAFE.We backed Hillary even though none of us really liked her. We cut Bernie off at the knees even though we actually liked him, because \\"oh, no, he's too extreme, he can't possibly win.\\" And who won instead? The most extreme, most polarizing, most blatantly unstable, most scandal-ridden, most hated candidate we've ever seen. Why? His base LIKES him. God knows why, but they really do. As much as we call him a \\"threat to democracy,\\" I've never seen a candidate more democratically chosen than him. NOBODY but his voters want him in that seat, but they really want him there, and they put him there twice.Biden was another bland, safe candidate, and he barely scraped out a victory. But he at least had genuine goodwill left over from the Obama years and a long career. Kamala had very little. She didn't do that well in the 2020 primaries. I give her a lot of credit for stepping up in a messy situation and taking her best swing, but once again, we put forward a candidate that we had little real enthusiasm for, and once again, we lost to the same nutjob whose voters really love him.Do you LIKE Pete? Do you LIKE what he has to say? Do you think he'd be a good President by YOUR standards? If you do, then support that guy! Stop overthinking it and trying to guess what other people will vote for. Trust your actual real opinions and feelings. Vote for who YOU would vote for. If you actually like him, chances are other people do too. If you throw him under the bus and pick a \\"safer\\" candidate who you don't actually like as much, chances are other people don't like them much either, and they won't turn up at the polls.It really is that simple. Last time we got it right was Obama. That was another \\"impossible\\" win. Those are the ones people actually show up for, I think.And who else do we really have that can do it? The only other person who's expressed interest in the job who I like and respect as much as Pete would be Cory Booker. I'd back him with equal enthusiasm. MAYBE Elizabeth Warren, but I think she plays too much into the inside-baseball left/right divisiveness for my tastes, whereas Pete and Booker are a lot more willing to reach out to a broader range of voters. Ditto for AOC, though I do think she's got potential in the future.I'd have no problem with a straight white guy running, if he was a good candidate, but... who? Name him.

Second, which is more important, the laws surrounding immunity of a sitting president (and presidential elects) are very muddy. They basically have immunity of most crimes, and it's hard to prove someone is guilty under these protections. These immunity laws are in place to protect presidents from criminal and civil cases that may distract them from their duties. This is why, even though the 37 felony charges have a crap ton of evidence, they most likely will be thrown out due to some of these crimes occurring while he was a sitting president. For example, there is more than enough proof to show he actively tampered and tried to conceal evidence of him keeping classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. If he would've turned them over and not talked to anyone about what the documents held, sure, don't charge him. A mistake, but understandable. However, he actively lied to the FBI and tampered with evidence. This then turns into a felony. Additionally, the cases that are being held in Georgia currently (the case that is trying to charge him for attempting to falsify voter records and overturn the election), will most likely be thrown out due to him becoming president in the next two months.  \\nThere is a case up against him currently, and they are trying to charge him for inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection. However, this happened while he was president, and people's jobs (mostly the judges and lawyers in the DOJ) will be at risk, since Trump is currently stating he will fire anyone on the case.","title":"Melania Trump declines to meet with Jill Biden at White House, citing Mar-a-Lago raid: source"},{"text":"social media = facebook boomer memes","title":"Jill Biden's apparent cold shoulder for Kamala Harris ignites social media"},{"text":"Yeah, this doesnt make sense as a premise.\\n- you can verify that a vote was legally and correctly cast and counted without disclosing which way the vote went, by matching the voter envelope to the voter rolls (the U.S. already does this, but some places within it implement the backwards lookup by voters themselves poorly)\\n- if you disclose the contents of a vote, you essentially doxx the voter to any number of politically motivated malicious actors.

The ballot is stamped when its submitted so no one can claim their vote wasn't counted just by taking it home without actually voting.

I agree that this messaging/disinformation crisis is clearly not something that can be handled with our standard messaging platform, and there is a very real need to break through and communicate with these voters (if it isn't already too late to call us all \\"voters\\"). Personally, I think the best tack we can borrow from is to treat this like an addiction. Primarily because - in many ways - it is. Real world answers, solutions, and explanations come with nuance and uncertainty, and are very often far too complex to boil down to a quip or a catchphrase. But disinformation/propaganda can be short, witty, and memorable. It's easy to digest, and it is specifically crafted (and AB tested, and modified) to give the listener the confidence that they now understand something which has been bothering them, and gives them permission to set that issue aside, having received a satisfactory answer to their concern. Whether or not that concern was planted by the same person giving out the \\"information\\", whether that information is trustworthy, accurate, or even plausible in reality is not important - it takes the discomfort away (or gives them someone/something to blame for it). A quick hit of confidence to dull the cognitive dissonance and creeping doubt. A lotto ticket that lets you go on with your day fantasizing about how it'll all be better on Friday when your ship comes in instead of worrying about those bills due tomorrow. It's a temporary \\"solution\\" to a problem too big to address head-on.Simply explaining how someone is wrong, or that they've been lied to won't work because it isn't about the truth anymore. You're not just correcting a misunderstanding, you're challenging a worldview, an identity, and flushing their stash at the same time. It's isolating, scary, and - depending on how long they've been using - exposing a very real and existential dread. If I've been lied to about X, what other lies have I accepted?  If I'm wrong about Y, am I wrong about everything? Am I gullible? Am I dumb?  Have my decisions hurt other people? Am I a bad person?.... It's a dark road. So - just like with every other addiction - if someone you know is reaching out, seeing the damage they're doing, and looking for a way out: help them detox. Get them off of social media, away from talk radio and network \\"news\\" and try to get them to take a technology vacation to recover.

Since he was first elected to a public office, his approach is one that seems defined by a belief that to make real change from the outside, you must push hard, but always maintain one foot inside the power structure and not try to burn it all the way down. The calculation is that if you are too adversarial against the establishment, you will be instantly marginalized, depicted as irrelevant and disempowered. (Side note: as the primary results show, the problem with this theory is that even if you are nice and dont go scorched earth, the power structure has other ways to defeat progressives.) As he himself said, Bernie likes and respects Biden. I personally dont believe that affinity is justified, considering Bidens legislative record, but Im not going to litigate that point.

This allowed the US to have one of the best armor in the world. (Tanks and Warships) China has largely subsidized their steel manufacturing making its products cheaper. Over time this lead to less profit for steel manufacturing in the US which leads to lower investment in new steel technologies and production capabilities. \\nChina has been taking the financial hit for flooding the market with cheap, nearly as good, steel but has gained a military advantage in doing so. Now, their steel industry no longer has to be subsidized as investment in new steel technology has become better than the US. Slave (and/or near slave) labor is also used to drive down prices further as well. In order to compete globally other countries competing in the steel industry must provide value to the customer in similar ways to compete for new business. This largely leaves the US with its high(er) regulations and general cost of doing business at a disadvantage. \\nNow, extend this example to nearly every other sector outside of financial and services and you can begin to see the real problem with free trade. \\nThis is why Trump has threatened tarriffs on vehicles produced in Mexico for example. (Tractors all well, I believe) He is seeking to stop US vehicle manufacturing (and the skills of the industry) from moving to Mexico where companies are seeking to avoid US labor costs and compete in the global market. \\nIn order for US manufacturing to compete they have to find value to the consumers somewhere. This is where the cost of regulation and labor really has an effect on a company seeking to compete with others without those burdens. (Or as many of those burdens, each country has different regulatory burdens)Interestingly, its becoming cheaper to produce in places like Mexico and India now over China. There are a lot of reasons for that, but it mostly revolves around cheaper shipping costs to/from the US and equally low labor costs.","title":"Can someone explain how Tariffs will be good for the economy?"},{"text":"Dems already fucking lost the election, what other reason do you have for supporting this continued slaughter?The pro-Israel-Lobby has them by the balls, it's not that difficult to understand.They were actually quite open from the beginning that they demand Israel to be given a free hand in the prosecution of this war.There also can't be any equivalency between the victims, that's exactly what we're witnessing here.","title":"A Final, Deadly Exclamation Point: Biden Backs Down on 30-Day Israel Arms Ultimatum"},{"text":"","title":"Social Systems win Culture Wars - here's how liberals and you (you personally!) can win the next one."},{"text":"They're telling us they're idiots.","title":"Voters who picked AOC and Trump are telling us something.

Look at the water vapor capacity of the atmosphere, it's exponential. Every 10C it goes up by about 80%. Water vapor is also a very portent green house gas.As an example (these aren't exact numbers): you increase atmospheric temperature by 1C you can now hold enough water vapor to increase it a further 0.1C. 2C, closer to 0.21C, 3C an extra .33C, and so on. Somewhere down the line going up 1C will push enough water into the atmosphere to heat it up another 1C, from there you can see the problem.There is a tipping point. It's hard to know exactly where that is, but if you look at models, maybe somewhere between 8-16C more than the industrial era.And because it's going to come up, no, cloud cover won't save us.

That is to say we burned it. From that heat we took energy. The exact amount doesn't matter, suffice it to say a given amount of fossil fuels produced a given amount of energy and given amount of CO2.Looked at more mathematically, X fossil fuels, produced Y energy and Z carbon.We can sequester that carbon, put it back on the ground, but that takes energy. A lot of energy, more than we got from burning it. Some of the best process take ten times more energy for the amount of carbon produced. That is, for every Megawatt of power we produce today, we'd have to spend 10 Megawatts tomorrow just to capture that carbon. That doesn't include keeping our cities lit up or anything. 10X fossil fuels, 10Y Energy all goes to trap -1Z carbon at the cost of 10Z carbon. A net of 9 units. Obviously that's not possible.Let's say we have a miracle, Jesus, Buddha, Moses, come down from the sky we are suddenly a carbon neutral society. All our power and energy comes from renewable, nothing produces carbon anymore. Yay!Ok, so we turn all that energy to carbon sequestration. We're not powering up our cities, not growing food, not playing games, just carbon sequestration.Using our 10:1 example, For every 10 units of energy we use, we will capture 1 unit of carbon from the old process. Ok, so 10X for -1Z. We're producing the same amount of energy as before, so it takes the same amount of time to generate 1 unit of energy it's just clean. So to generate our 10X will take 10 times more time. So 1 year's worth of carbon will take 10 years to sequester back. to go back 10 units of carbon, will take 100 units of energy or 100 units of time. To go back to were were were in 2014 will take a century, 2004, 2 centuries, etc. Again, assuming we start today and do nothing but carbon sequestration.However it's not possible to devote all our energy to this, even assuming we want to. So what if we did half? Well then the numbers all double. Going back a year takes 20 years, a decade 2 centuries, and 20 years will take 400 years. This also assumes an optimist 10:1. 20:1 is more realistic, you can see the problem here.We don't have time to wait. Trying to go back even a year, is a herculean undertaking.

But they have flat out murdered people that have opposed them,.There's a whole war now here, and we don't know what the future will look like, but what I can tell you for sure is that **we absolutely need some kind of LBJ** because fascists, the billionaire class, death-cultists, self-serving corrupt politicians, boomer men into dirty politics and dirty money, etc., - they don't give up power easily and if you give them an inch they take a mile.I may be a mini-mini-mini figure like that for a tiny tiny part of Lebanon some day, as a few people have told me I should run for office (it's just so complicated here,  and again historically they'd either rig the election [like unironically, I mean this lol] or threaten you or just kill you depending on how much of a threat you are.We haven't gotten to that point in the U.S. , I hope/think.**Sp please fight like hell guys. Starting from now, you can't be anything but daily active participants in this audacious political experiment in a diverse tolerant multicultural multiethnic multiracial politically diverse democratic republic. **I so recognize all the amazing work Biden has done, I absolutely recognize the excellent campaign VP Harris and Gov. Walz ran.Unfortunately it's not even a drop in the bucket of what we need to fight this movement toward a so-called \\"post-democratic order\\" (I think project 2025 puts it in those terms right? someone fact check me).So yeah, we have stoics on democracy's siide both here in Lebanon and in the U.S. We really do.But we have not been enabled to come to the arena in some cases, in other cases (e.g., again, in Lebanon) it may be deadly to try.Either way, it's time we actually show ourselves who we really are.And I promise you, especially given that America welcomed my immigrant Muslim parents with open arms in the 80s, the America we see today is not who we really are.This iis disinformation. This is working class people hurting. And this is shit like billionaires uniting the crazy people that normally never even know of each other and turning them into a whole MAGA cult (e.g., Musk and twitter).So we're figfhting big forces, and these but a few.We really need to swing a big something or another around, and I think we need that LBJ spirit.But, I admit, American presidential history is a weak point of mine so maybe I'm full of shit lol.","title":"Full List of Democrats Who Voted for Bill That Gives Trump Admin More Power"},{"text":"For starters, immigrants have very little understanding of our government, our voting process and it's the last thing they're interested in when they first get here.

Basically giving a hypothetical example of how both sides basically get away with doing crapy stuff but because one is \\"less worse\\" people vote for them and the cycle continues to repeat. I have seen the arguments for it, and it makes sense.   \\nTrue the gov't is slow at passing anything because of \\"checks and balances\\" but it's clear most politicians are getting bribed.. I mean.. lobbied -\\\\_- to pass laws and bills that favor rich people/corporations to get away with crap. And only way that will ever change (it wont) is if said politicians pass laws to prevent themselves from getting away with it. :SPeople don't look at the long term, or the history to see how things keep getting worse no matter which \\"party\\" is in office. Dems get in you take 1 step forward, but 2 steps back. Reps get in and take maybe 1 step forward but most of the time its only 2-4 steps back. Dems get back in and 1 step forward but then 2-3 steps back in some instances. \\"Oh we have to clean up the mess the previous administration created\\". But then when they have 2 terms in a row some stuff still doesn't happen, and they make excuses while passing bills/laws that allow corporations to get away with more crap.  \\nJust look at stuff like federal minimum wage how it should be close to $23 an hour or something but it's not even close to that. Or how we still have for profit colleges/universities. Still don't have universal health care when other countries figured it out a long time ago. As well as all the monopolies/oligopolies out there in the market screwing people over. And how we continue to waste a lot of money being put into the military and money somehow disappears or isn't accounted for and that just never comes back up. ETC!  \\nBernie is the only candidate that I can think of that isn't full of BS like so many politicians out there. We know that, because we have seen it time and time again. You still get people who will  about how his ideas wouldn't work if he was president or bla bla bla. But it's clear he would have been a much better president than either side could ever come up with way back then. I voted for him back then even though he wasn't an option anymore, cause Hilary and the Dems screwed him over cause they didn't want rich people to lose money. My vote just like this time didn't matter though cause I live in a red state full of old geezers. Literally 70% or more red all down the board so none of my choices mattered. I almost didn't go vote this time because of it, but I wasted my time researching (though most don't fill out any info on what they stand for, or have horrible websites/none to gain any info on) and going to vote anyways and voted for the least worst options and again was a waste of time here.The ones here who will complain about stuff like everyone getting $2k from the gov't because of covid and how that caused younger people to not want to work a year or two after the fact. This is a legit reason an old geezer gave to other old geezers I overheard while at work a few years ago. Cause yeah $2k is SO much money to live off of for over a year. /s When so many jobs around here suck and offer awful wages/benefits (if any). They wonder why teenagers leave this state after high school and don't return.   \\nSure this isn't as bad as countries like China, and Russia etc, but people have to quit using those as reasons as to why it's \\"SOO great to live here\\", and pull their head out of their ass and focus on the long term problems instead of focusing on what celebrity is doing what, or that the news is talking about illegal immigrants are flooding in by the billions each day on the southern boarder and what each side would do if they were in charge like they haven't been this entire time this country started having these problems?","title":"Bernie Sanders in 2003 - How Republicans Win"},{"text":"Ukraine has launched drone strikes into Russia killing 80 Russian civilians, are we saying its okay to kill Russian civilians now?","title":"A Final, Deadly Exclamation Point: Biden Backs Down on 30-Day Israel Arms Ultimatum"},{"text":"I got these puffy slippers to wear in the house.

Pete has said that there are people who voted for him and Obama and Trump and Pence for Governor, based on who they thought would be most helpful, and I honestly think thats very indicative of a lot of middle America. People vote for the person they vibe with sometimes across party lines, and I think a savvy midwesterner could do well in the crucial swing states. That being said, Pete was reelected as mayor BEFORE he came out, so we dont have a test case. But he was well respected and well liked among almost everyone regardless. I think its feasible. Veterans like him because he served in the military, for example. Immigrants like him because hes culturally competent and multilingual. A lot of queer folks might vote for him over someone that wasnt. Hes a practicing Christian, so that will get some folks on board. Hes a family man, and that cant hurt.

The bill's passage would apply the amendments made in it to taxable years after its enactment, including those of the incoming Trump administration. The current version of the bill, which Representative Claudia Tenney introduced, is paired with a provision that offers tax relief to Americans who are \\"unlawfully or wrongfully detained abroad, or held hostage abroad.\\"No need to read between the lines, this is pretty typical for Republicans. They use vague wording or broad language and then get to dictate for themselves what falls under the purview of that language.\\"Terrorist supporting\\" could easily applyaccording to Republicansto any non-profit that's advocated for innocent civilians in Gaza for instance.Even any non-profit that's advocated for LGBTQ, abortion rights, or BLM.And therein lies the disingenuousness of the Republican agenda. They try to pass legislation like this, knowing full well how they'll abuse it, and when it fails to pass, the GOP exploits the opportunity to accuse democrats of being \\"terrorist sympathizers.\\" It's kind of a lose-lose situation (or a win-win depending on your perspective). However, this nuance isn't important to those pushing their narratives.Think about how they do this with \\"election integrity\\" laws that use election denying language to suppress and subvert the vote, or laws targeting public school curricula, or even laws that use language like \\"pornography\\" and \\"sexual orientation.\\" Also, think about how Republicans will apply this tactic to laws that target immigrants, children of immigrants, asylum seekers, those on a pathway to citizenship, etc...Imagine if Democrats tried to pass a bill like this, with less extreme language of course, that targeted the tax exempt status of churches. Conservatives would be in an uproar.And what's to stop another incarnation of the bill being passed next year? In a blog post urging members of Congress to kill the bill, Kia Hamadanchy, ACLU's senior policy counsel, said, \\"The freedom to dissent without fear of government retribution is a vital part of any well-functioning democracy, which is why Congress must block H.R. 9495 before it's too late.I appreciate the sentiment, especially considering the ACLU is a nonprofit that some Republicans might label \\"terrorist supporting,\\" but let's see how well \\"dissent\\" fares after January 20th of next year...
