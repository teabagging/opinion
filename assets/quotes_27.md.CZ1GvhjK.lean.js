The problem is that prioritize liberals laissez-faire economics even as that is what feeds the extremist right. Every single pro-worker policy has to fought over tooth and nail, which makes these coalitions ineffectual. It's why they focus on the non-economic liberal causes, where they both agree, but while these causes are good they are not enough when inequality keeps rising. You saw this happen even when democracies were threatened by authoritarian communism or fascism, and you see it happen now. Two, you have to be wary not to fall into the same openly racist immigrant-blaming rhetoric that most of them prefer. Agreed. The issue is that immigration can not be stopped without serious human rights abuses. It's something that humans have always done, and will always do. The way to approach this IMHO is to focus on the fact that extremist right wing government don't actually lower immigration, because their corporate sponsors want it. Emphasize that these far right parties are hand in glove with the big companies who want to suppress wages. Whenever they bring up immigration, deflect it to their unwillingness to handle it and focus on why they don't (i.e. because they're corrupt and incompetent). When they say they are willing to \\"let go\\" of human rights to \\"protect the borders\\", point out how their corporate overlords will also want them to do that to their workers. Even if people can't have empathy with foreigners, they could still react when their rights are under threat too.\\nCombine this with a realistic policy (e.g. lowering legal immigration with the understanding that this will cause inflation and slow growth) if you need to.","title":"Bernie Sanders accuses Musk of seeking cheaper immigrant labor with H-1B visas"},{"text":"I'm in the same boat but for dodgeball.?

Usually, one would expect your family to be part of your \\"tribe\\"\\nBut social media has turned that on its head. It's not hard to find people complaining about parents / grandparents due to differing political beliefs, catalyzed by social media.\\nAnd, at some point, if you are part of several intersecting and disjoint \\"tribes\\", isn't that just having ideas? As a concrete example, there's a large number of people who are pro-Palestine, anti-China, and a large number who are pro-Palestine, pro-China.\\nWhile you could consider this membership in two tribes - just how many tribes can one be part of before it's no longer \\"tribalism\\"?\\nMoreover, in the past, it was much more common to identify as a Republican or a Democrat, and go with policies just based on the party that proposed them.

Tolerance and progress often come *after* legislative changes, when people have time to adjust to the new status quo. Had abolition movements really changed the moral framework of the majority, before legal reforms (don't forget - there literally was a war that enforced their will), subsequent attempts to re institute slavery, like debt Peonage, Jim Crow laws, segregation, wouldn't have happened.\\nGay rights are contested even now - with many Southern states arguing that it should be legal to outlaw on a religious basis. Had the hearts and minds truly been convinced? been the precursor to gay marriage, this wouldn't follow.\\nI'd like to dig a step deeper here too. Is \\"benefit of the majority\\" always relevant? At its height, the Nazi party had ~38% popularity, a plurality. If, hypothetically, it had been even higher (i.e 90%) would that make what they did okay? Would opposing them, and standing against the status quo, be \\"unproductive\\"?\\n*Even if* by the time real change has been enacted, 50%+ have been convinced, every step until that point, there was a minority who believes in a certain conception of justice, against the wills most people. Were they wrong to spread these beliefs?\\n Unproductive discussion outweighs productive discussion?\\nThat's going to always be true - social media or not. As they say \\"talk is cheap\\". Add in that click bait/ rage bait? is profitable, and the general volume of content on the internet, and you'll be able to observe lots of useless fluff. But amongst that fluff is gold.\\nOne can say that before, the 2 factions were significantly stronger and agreed on more. But also, before social media, a supermajority of the nation was completely fine with invading a country halfway across the world, to seize nuclear weapons that didn't exist, and murdering, directly or indirectly, hundreds of thousands of people.?\\nI don't think the fact that there was more \\"respectful agreement\\" is a positive, if it can lead to much abhorrent conditions.\\n Dispassionate conversation\\nIs this productive? Having beliefs that you stand for is not a bad thing. If you were to try and argue that slavery is good, I would disagree most vehemently. Passionate speech is convincing.?\\n Shared search for better understanding\\nAgain - center is not inherently better. If we argue about the pros and cons of slavery, it is not a better conversation or I cede ground, and try to genuinely see the merits of slavery. It is not a \\"shared search\\". A better, more productive conversation is one sided - where I convince you AWAY from slavery, outright. Using evidence is one form of persuasion - and one that's frequently used (death counts, costs, other statistics are frequently used by one set-in-stone side to try to convince the other)\\n Less logical fallacies, etc\\nThe ends justify the means. If, by logical fallacy, I convince you of my heartfelt belief that slavery is bad, it is a more productive conversation than if, through dispassionate argumentation, we arrive at an impasse.\\nLooping this back to social media. Is there plenty of fear mongering, fake news, pointless arguments that don't convince anyone? Sure.\\nBut it's also allowed common people to spread ideas that would get you executed or cancelled when only major news existed, groups to meet other people and learn about themselves in ways that would never be possible without the internet (ie queer folks from the south meeting accepting people), and so forth.\\nTo simply cast out the whole thing as unproductive, when social media has unearthed numerous injustices that would normally be easy to hide under the covers, feels reaching, and only inspired by a desire to reduce conflict by upholding the status quo","title":"CMV: Social media, including Reddit, does not reliably produce productive political discussion"},{"text":"You cannot be serious.Trump and Elon want to deport ILLEGAL immigrants.

They have no rights to become independent except by an act of congress (where they have no representation), they are subject to (a subset) of federal taxes, and are subject to all federal US laws.","title":"CMV: The territories should be given either 1 voting member each or a at large voting member to the US House of representatives"},{"text":"![gif](giphy|Eq3C7C5PWMUIRpxR3j|downsized)","title":"Biden &amp; His Cronies Take One Last Vacation Together."},{"text":"The immigrants going to Canada and The USA are pretty different","title":"Bernie Sanders accuses Musk of seeking cheaper immigrant labor with H-1B visas"},{"text":"\\"Does not reliably\\" emcompasses the gamut of effectivenessMy definition is too loose indeed. Your and other's insightful contributions are forcing me to be more clear and specific.people can't have these discussions anyway and they must be able to be had reliably on the internet1. Most people, not all people. 2. My argument is not that they must be able to have those conversations on social media or the internet broadly. In the example I gave of this forum, you can see firsthand positions move on political topics, and hell... it happens every single day here reliably.Apologies, which example are you referring to?Otherwise, this gives me hope. But this subreddit is still a tiny sliver of social media political discussion. I'm sure not all examples are as bad as the one I cited in another comment thread about how \\"CMV: white people countries are more racist\\". To me, even if the poster changed their mind, that conversation is unproductive as a whole. Although that judgment puts me in a difficult position; how do people come to informed conclusions then? My first thought would be - informed, dispassionate, digestible, etc. discussion of these questions (or less loaded, but related questions) modeled by experts or otherwise more educated individuals.","title":"CMV: Social media, including Reddit, does not reliably produce productive political discussion"},{"text":"Those things are not inherent to political discussion.\\"unwaivering adherence and partisanship\\" I would say is exemplified throughout human political history. \\"unwaivering adherence and partisanship\\" is also a product of cognitive biases at work. To that extent, these traits are inherent to human nature, and so they are commonplace in political discussions, especially so on social media. Quickly - \\"unwaivering\\" doesn't necessarily mean someone has said they won't consider other views. Rather, I could roughly define it as someone who, because of cognitive biases, including partisan bias and tribalism, effectively is not considering other stances in a charitable and reasonably dispassionate manner. They may wholeheartedly think they are, but their actions show to a group of reasonable people across the political spectrum, that they are not. Now, that doesn't mean that \\"unwaivering adherence and partisanship\\" are impossible to bypass. As you rightly point out, there are many people who are open to reconsider their stances. However, the traits that cause someone to be willing to reconsider their stance/be open-minded/dispassionate/etc. are less likely to be nurtured, promoted and otherwise incentivized on social media. At least the mainstream systems/platforms I'm aware of.(compromise) (...) that's in no way needed for a political discussion to be fruitfulI'm not sure what I think about this. However, if I needed to commit to a view, according to my definition of productive (see most recent comment with [throwawayhq222](/user/throwawayhq222/)) I would agree that compromise is not always needed for a political discussion to be fruitful.Introducting doubt and fresh perspectives isn't that difficult. We needn't proof during a conversation either, that the conversation hasn't shifted perspectives or views even if they aren't loudly decalred and in the case of this sub, awarded a Delta.Could you clarify what you mean here? My fault, but also if you could tie it in to how my argument fails or is lacking, my pleb brain is getting maxed out here.\\"Introducting doubt and fresh perspectives isn't that difficult.\\" - You're right it's not difficult to introduce a contrary political idea to someone, and maybe even doubt. But, it is difficult on social media to get the majority of people to reconsider their stances, moreso if the political issue is controversial, there are partisan/tribal divides. Because of the reasons above.","title":"CMV: Social media, including Reddit, does not reliably produce productive political discussion"},{"text":"Im not completely familiar with the system in the US, but this same time of visa is absolutely weaponised against domestic workers here in Australia.Unless youre lucky enough to be in an industry with a very politically influential trade union.","title":"Bernie Sanders Is Still Wrong About Immigration.

You do bring up one good point though  there was no option to stay a territory.  However, any inference about the lack of a territory option is pure speculation.  We do have verifiable facts regarding how many people preferred statehood to independence or free association.  Maybe this is an indication of people just thinking statehood is the least of two evils and being a territory is preferable, maybe this is an indication that statehood is becoming a more popular idea as time progresses.  The truth is that the majority of people that voted looked at that poll and said statehood is the best option; if you have any actual data to back up the theory you proposed Id love to see it, but right now the vote is the closest to an actual poll we have that I know of.","title":"CMV: The territories should be given either 1 voting member each or a at large voting member to the US House of representatives"},{"text":"Last remnants of the US democracy jerk each other off while letting nazis take over and brutally fuck over Americans","title":"Joe Biden to award Liz Cheney presidential medal"},{"text":"Yeah cuz I trust them","title":"Bernie Sanders Is Still Wrong About Immigration.

For our purpose: determining what is 'the good' today, I would take a leap and say:judging historic peoples against our modern conceptions of morality isn't useful. Indeed, what is good, is dependent on the definition of that time. Because of that, a conception of good must be widely held during the time in question. The work that abolitionists did, gay marriage advocates, and what others like them do, is to change public conceptions of morality. Once abolitionists changed public conceptions of morality, slavery finally became immoral (after thousands of years). This is probably the weakest point of my argument, as I'm not even sure I'm fully confident in this assertion.^(1) (although I'm not sure about different places within the same time period). \\"It's very, very hard to measure this - especially when social media has negative effects completely unrelated to politics.\\"I agree. However, I think we can make a reasonable approximation. Do you? I think the subjectivity of morality debate aside, there is wide agreement on the amount of negatives that come out of the internet, although I'm more confident in specifying *social media*, that the positives are outweighed by the negatives. Would you agree?Even if not, my argument is not that the negatives outweigh the positives, but that unproductive political discussion greatly outweighs productive political discussion. I may, however, need to revise my definition of productive (remove the good) part.

I'd argue that's probably impossible, because tribalism is human nature (would you agree?)Almost everyone can agree slavery abolition was good, any conception of good, must be held widely\\"The same can be said about any major social change - universal suffrage, mixed race couples, etc. all of these went against the status quo, and against majority opinion.\\"As you wisely pointed out, morality was different back then. Now my next point is a normative (subjective) argument, but different periods^(1) of history should be judged according to their specific understandings of morality. We cannot expect that historic peoples would behave according to our modern, specific conceptions of morality that didn't exist to them.

Their pay is exactly what they would pay a US citizen in these same roles, and I believe there are significant numbers of qualified American graduates who are capable of doing these jobs sitting unemployed right now.The way I see it is that big tech companies should be investing in the future of the labor force via their entry and mid level roles. So when there are unemployed, qualified Americans, that means US companies are failing to re-invest in the country. And potentially taking advantage of that H1B worker at the same time, who can't negotiate or switch jobs freely like a citizen can. WITCH companies of course are another area that needs to be fixed, too.Of course, I don't blame anyone trying for an H1B visa.

Estimates suggest that around 2 to 4 points of inflation at its peak in 2022 were directly caused by Biden's stimulus alone - plus there's the potential that the overspending also helped exacerbate pre-existing supply chain weaknesses via demand shock, meaning the overall impact of the stimulus alone could have been even larger with that indirect aggregate demand shock element.

Ultimately less Americans died in Afghanistan in his term than the last 3 presidents)- Managed Ukraine War (Yes, it's not a perfect war, but reading Bob Woodward's book, it seems he handled it as well as one could. The intel community told him it could be a 50-50 chance Putin would use nukes, and he had to find a way to defend while preventing WW3. The result appears to be an extremely weak Russia, a strong NATO, and a largely held together Ukraine)- Semi-conductor controls (Often forgotten, but Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo has been waging an epic fight against China on Semiconductor controls, including rules that Americans who help China get advanced semiconductors will loose citizenship. Time will tell how this will pan out, but this could be a major blow to China's ability to compete with the US on long term military AI tech)- Uniting the Pacific Allies (AUKUS and the Japan-Korea-US defense plans are a huge deal, providing a united front in the face of China's spreading influence) - Lowest unemployment levels in 53 years (pretty wild to have such a successful recovery after covid).- Best antitrust and pro-union administration since LBJ (Lina Khan at FTC and the folks at the NLRB have been absolutely amazing for the middle class the last 4 yearsC not to mention he's the first president to join a picket line) - Passed the **Respect for Marriage Act**- Took out the leaders of Al Qaeda and ISIS- Passed the **Safer Communities Act** to reduce gun violence Oh and also, outside the presidency, he was one of the first to actually support gay marriage.

I also think you're using WWII as a template for what WWIII would look like. One huge difference, though, is the economic reliance didn't exist amongst the players in WWII that exist between China and the US.Like here you say:?China has way more manufacturing capability than the USWhat you're looking at is China's output capacity. But what you're missing is China lacks a lot of natural resources and component parts which it has to import in order to take advantage of its manufacturing scale, and a naval blockade alone stops those inputs from coming in.China, in order to be competitive, pegs its currency to the dollar. It holds trillions of dollars in T-bonds in order to make the peg work. On top of that, it holds dollar dominated assets and all of that would be a huge blow.All of international trade uses the dollar - so economic sanctions would make it really hard for China to have a functioning economy. Its internal consumption and purchasing power isn't enough to make up for access to the US and European markets, not even close. This isn't even getting into the loss of international investment.China, for decades, have been trying to de-dollarize the international economy but can't. When you look at what China imports from the US - agriculture, machine and mechanical appliances/equipment, you realize that the whole \\"China dominates manufacturing\\" trope forgets that it's interdependent. The question is it harder to re-vamp in the US or elsewhere, or harder to get a consumer base to sell the things in? What if critical components for the manufacturing can't be imported, is there enough IP knowledge in China to recreate it? How will they feed themselves?We haven't gotten into the fact that the ruling party's entire legitimacy has been placed on perpetual economic growth.

I think that the trans community has asked for way too much, way too quickly. Not just in terms of scientific study of transgenderism, but in general asks from wider society. We are kidding ourselves if we're unwilling to acknowledge that A. There's not really any evidence that Trans women perform comparably to cis women, and B. The basic reality is that trans women generally are taller, have larger hands, longer leg and arm spans, a wider and more sturdy skeletal structure, and that this advantage just cannot be wiped away. Ofc lots of cis women are outliers too, so I really just don't know, given the lack of widespread research - but so many people who support trans issues just *very confidently* declare there's no issue. I think it's fairly obvious when the science/statistic based democratic wing of politics suddenly ignores scientific truisms applied literally everywhere else, with sample sizing, lack of evidence, etc. it's just very obviously hypocritical. There's like a dozen trans athletes so I'm aware that ultimately it's a non-issue used by conservatives, but we are just blatantly acting in bad faith when we argue so strongly in favor of trans inclusion in sports. Pointing out it doesn't matter, rightfully, doesn't change this.Second, the trans community's narrative at this point is almost entirely centered on \\"validity\\". The community is constantly fending off attacks pointed at people that politically disengaged people notice deviating significantly from the common understanding of a trans person. On some level, frankly, I can't disagree with them. The sheer quantity of nonbinary trans people who are *entirely* gender conforming is disheartening. I've been to several pride clubs at 3 different universities, all 3 of them were overwhelmingly cis conforming AFAB people saying they're nonbinary. The group leader was a gender conforming AMAB who went by Ze/Zir, the only noticeable difference was a pink highlight in his hair.It's just, gender non conforming as a category has existed for so long lol. I really don't know if the term \\"transgender\\" should refer to people who clearly more belong in that category. Their experiences are just not terribly relevant. HRT, Gender confirming surgery, societal oppression, shared trauma from growing up trans and being hated by your family, hate crimes perpetrated against us, none of that came up in *any* of my pride clubs. It felt more like a nebulous gathering of generally left wing people with essentially no relevance to any of the traumas and trials I've faced and wanted support on. I dunno, it just feels like the trans community doesn't have a shared suffering that's being projected to build empathy with broader society. It's more about feverish discussion of validity and micro identities, essentially like a leftist theory forum. I can't even feel at home in it despite being trans because it doesn't feel like anyone actually cares about it. I don't know what to do, it feels like trans people like me just don't have a home.","title":"The Democrats Culture Denialism"},{"text":"I'd donate for a GoFundMe for this plaque.","title":"At this point, I have no hope: Injured officers, Democrats still waiting for Jan. 6 plaque | It would honor police who defended the Capitol, but Congress spurned the deadline"},{"text":"If Biden just didnt do anything wouldnt Trump have blocked this?","title":"Biden decides to block U.S. Steel sale to Japanese buyer"},{"text":"Thank you.","title":"Biden decides to block U.S. Steel sale to Japanese buyer"},{"text":"Because until this past year, he really was.","title":"Biden decides to block U.S. Steel sale to Japanese buyer"},{"text":"Its not worth explaining it to some of these people.

This article is very well written and researched. This guy found a bunchnof other instances from decades past of the media reporting on a lonliness epidemic.

Before the internet there was nowhere to do that. Hell, on 4chan they seem to compete with each other over who is the lonliest. What really bothers me is how this phenomenon is really only discussed in terms of how it applies to men. Male lonliness epidemic and whatnot. I feel like that comes from an assumption that women always have people fawning over them and giving them attention. Like sure, attractive women get that. So do attractive men.

Let me break down why.First, youre way off about military capabilities. The U.S. military absolutely dwarfs Chinas in terms of combat experience, technology, and power projection. The U.S. has 14,000 military aircraft versus Chinas 2,800, and the U.S. planes are far more advanced. Americas nuclear arsenal is over 7 times larger than Chinas, 3,700 warheads versus around 500. Sure, China has more missiles, but quantity isnt everything.Your manufacturing argument misses some key points too. While China makes more stuff overall, they seriously lag in advanced military manufacturing. Most Chinese factories make consumer goods, not weapons. The U.S. actually has better military manufacturing know how, when you need complex injection molded parts or precision machining for weapons, America has the edge. Chinas manufacturing advantage is mainly in cheap consumer goods, not advanced military hardware.The morale argument is just wrong. China hasnt fought a real war in decades. Their military has zero combat experience. Meanwhile, U.S. forces are battle tested. In a real conflict, China would face what Iraq did in the Gulf War, their massive but inexperienced military getting decimated by superior U.S. technology and tactics.You also ignore Americas biggest advantageallies. The U.S. has five major treaty allies in Asia (Japan, South Korea, Australia, Philippines, Thailand) with military bases spread throughout the region. China has...North Korea? U.S. allies are increasing defense spending and strengthening ties specifically because they fear China. In any conflict, China would be completely isolated.The Nazi Germany comparison is backwards. China is the one with quantity over quality, while the U.S. has both. America outspends China militarily by a huge margin and leads in critical areas like AI, quantum computing, and aerospace. Chinas military modernization is impressive but theyre still decades behind in key areas.Your view seems based more on headlines than hard facts. The reality is that Chinas military, while improving, still cant challenge U.S. dominance. They know this too, its why they focus on regional capabilities rather than trying to match America globally. A war would be devastating for both sides, but Americas advantages in technology, experience, alliances and power projection mean China isnt close to winning one.","title":"CMV: China will win a war against the US"},{"text":"The cost of power required to run the arc furnace is the real bottleneck.

If a company hires an H1B who then gets sent back to countries with less strict IP laws, well good luck trying to bring them to court.

You can't always know that someone is approaching you with romantic interest. Consider if A asks B for directions because A think they are cute...but then nothing happens. Well A is going to say they approached someone and nothing happened, and B is going to report that they've never approached anyone. Traditional dating etiquette sort of reinforces this...because you are expected to be coy and not too forward. Being too forward is considered tacky but particularly now a days. Which brings me to my next point which is that dating has changed. I know plenty of normal or plain or even conventionally \\"unattractive\\" people who date or are married. But they didn't meet by being randomly approached or flirted with...they met through friends or work or dating sites or whatever. Do those situations count as \\"being approached?\\" I think most people would not. I think a lot of people, particularly those who subscribe to \\"manosphere\\" content are still thinking about dating in the \\"traditional\\" model of approaching people and not realizing that most relationships happen naturally over time. So I suspect there is partly a vocabulary difference here as well as a shift in the dynamics of dating. So it's not like they are necessarily lying when they say they have never been approached. If they have no way of knowing, how can you possibly quantify that?

China had one-child policy for decades. You think parents are enthusiastic about their only boy being sent off to go fight a war.. especially against the USA? Think about it.

China relies largely on russia for its oil, at this time. And **war requires lots of oil**, especially if you intend on transporting millions of fighters and supplies across the Pacific Ocean. And if china even tried to, well just interrupt their oil supply chain from their rear. So lets just be honest, it would be the other way around. China gets invaded.The US navy begins by blockading chinas coastlines along the pacific, south china sea &amp; sea of japan. Yellow river and others leading to ocean. And **war requires lots of money**, especially if you intend on fighting superior military. So this blockade ALONE will restrict chinas commercial trade ports, making it difficult for china to continue financing a war. Meanwhile : American military personnel and supplies will start being delivered in great numbers building up in taiwan, japan, south korea, philippines and malaysia, awaiting orders to prepare for amphibious &amp; paramilitary invasion of proc mainland.

Some examples:\\nwomen are overwhelmingly expected to give up their careers or reduce hours when children arrive compared to their husbands. This may not be sexism directly encountered in the workplace, but its still societal and cultural sexism that parenting is seen primarily as womans work and responsibility. Women are also less encouraged from a young age to pursue higher paying careers by parents, teachers, society, etc. my sister was told by multiple people that she shouldnt be a lawyer because itll be harder for her to be a mom later and because taking out loans doesnt make sense when she will have to stop working a few years after. This wasnt said in the workplace but by family and friends. Still sexism in a social level. There are also factors that may not exist in an office setting but at the level of hiring and promotion. A classic study shows that identical resumes with black sounding names are less likely to get called for an interview than those with white sounding names. https://www.npr.org/2024/04/11/1243713272/resume-bias-study-white-names-black-names\\nFactors like this also impact who ends up in which job. Lastly, factors like education determine who has access to which careers long before people enter the workforce. Minority-dense school systems revive much less funding in the US than predominantly white school systems. https://edtrust.org/press-room/school-districts-that-serve-students-of-color-receive-significantly-less-funding/\\nMeaning that someones ability to go into high paying fields is diminished by the time theyre in kindergarten, and is very much a result of systemic racism even if it not occurring in a workplace. I think if you broaden the scope of your thinking on the topic to include factors that encompass a whole human, not just what happens in HR departments, youll see that the gender/racial wage gaps still reflect sexism and racism, which is what people generally use them to support in argument.","title":"CMV: The men vs. women pay gap and racial pay gap in the US does not prove that there is widespread sexism or racism in the workplace"},{"text":"Oddly enough both Bernie and the MAGAs are right for once.

Let's start with a candidate who doesn't play around with the Cheney's.By far the most important: let's start with a candidate who isn't a freaking robot on the debate stage and seems to care about the lived experience and the shared frustration of the American people. There's a reason that \\"I feel your pain\\" is an iconic line by a Democrat: Bill Clinton understood the American people's frustration (or at least showed that he cared about it). Trump does this nonstop. The only Democrat I see with the kind of charisma trump has (and, yes, he is unfortunately charismatic) is Bernie Sanders and Michelle Obama. Whether you agree or disagree with Sanders' policies, it is *undeniable* that his words resonate with plenty of people because he's truly *passionate* about what he does. Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton don't show passion. I don't think Joe does either, for that matter, but he lucked out by running in a year where everyone wanted a change.So, run a passionate candidate -- ideally one whose policies will benefit the American people.","title":"Americans: Vote and save our democracy!

Not to mention the people determining a lot of maternity leaves and when \\"is enough time\\" are usually men who didn't just have organs removed, been in labor for potentially days, and aren't severely torn and need to heal. What I'm getting at is, there's less understanding for women because ultimately the men deciding things for them that impact their pay will never actually experience what they've gone through and tend to minimize it. The fact that they're making choices without properly informed information about how womens bodies work differently than a man's is in fact indicative of sexism. The policies are inherently sexist because they're applying standards for how a man's body should operate onto a woman. Men's bodies are used as the default of policy.

I feel like the full report (it's on foreign and security policy) would interest you a lot, check it out: https://da.uni.gl/media/4bwb5ict/survey-report-leander_ackre-n_final.pdfAnd interesting statistic is [Figure 3](https://i.gyazo.com/6c67ea4d65a2b3c80997c3f5b2f3edc1.png), which covers cooperation with other countries and organisations, in which you'll see that Greenlanders would like to cooperate less with the US compared to 2021. To be fair, the trend of lower enthusiasm for cooperation is visible across the board with nearly all large countries on the list (the US, China, UK and Russia), but it still doesn't support the idea that Greenlanders would join the US in a referendum. And keep in mind that this report was conducted back in spring 2024, so way before all this new rhetoric from Trump.You'll also notice that Canada is one that hasn't declined by as much, and is not only more popular than the US, but the top country overall too (with Iceland). Denmark is also the country that has declined the least, and the EU is the only entry on the list where enthusiasm for cooperation has actually increased.

You say:   \\n\\\\ Now could it be that sexism may be partially to blame as to why women pursue lower-paing careers and are still much more likely then men to take time off work to look after children? Maybe, sure. But it's hard to say to what extent. There are probably also millions of women who genuinely prefer being a stay-at-home mum or who really may not be interested in pursuing a high-paying but at the same time extremely stressful career that requires crazy hours. After all men and women are different physiologically and psychologically, and that is also gonna show in terms of the career decisions they make.  \\nBut you do not cite any sources - or research. Looking at for instance [https://www.epi.org/blog/gender-wage-gap-persists-in-2023-women-are-paid-roughly-22-less-than-men-on-average/](https://www.epi.org/blog/gender-wage-gap-persists-in-2023-women-are-paid-roughly-22-less-than-men-on-average/) \\\\- we see that black and hispanic women are disproportionalely impacted by the pay gap. Do you believe that black and hispanic women somehow \\"prefer being a stay-at-home mum\\" to a greater extent than white women..? Is that the most plausible explanation for such data?   \\nAnd when:  \\n\\\\About half of employed women (48%) report feeling a great deal of pressure to focus on their responsibilities at home, compared with 35% of employed men. Among working mothers with children younger than 18 in the household, two-thirds (67%) say the same, compared with 45% of working dads. (https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/03/01/gender-pay-gap-facts/)  \\nDo you still think it is likely that these 48 and 67 % of employed women do this by choice?","title":"CMV: The men vs. women pay gap and racial pay gap in the US does not prove that there is widespread sexism or racism in the workplace"},{"text":"For real, I don't have any faith in \\"norms\\" anymore at this point.","title":"Biden decides to block U.S. Steel sale to Japanese buyer"},{"text":"Chat, is this true?https://preview.redd.it/ugh1b5sgzrae1.jpeg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc723a6636a60c460b5b33b5c17deb13c8ac7ef5","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Who is asking for more taxes?","title":"They need liberals."},{"text":"If Doctors made $55,000/year you dont think Healthcare costs would come down?Working in a warehouse or Landscaping is below the dignity of Americans is probably why they lose the blue collar vote rather than a disinformation campaign?","title":"Bernie Sanders says Elon Musk is wrong about H-1B visas: 'Low-wage indentured servants'"},{"text":"Thunderbolt Fantasy is an amazing wuxia puppet series.

If we made Medicare for ALL and raised the reimbursement rates, we could require all providers to take it and finally give us mental health parity.Additionally, America is supposed to be the land of opportunity and innovation, but so many people are unable to pursue new businesses and opportunities bc they are tied to their job for health insurance. If we have universal health insurance, people could be empowered to quit their jobs to create new businesses and ultimately create more jobs and products and services and fuel the economy more.

Because France and Britain had a system of imperial preference, they imported significant quantities raw materials from their colonies at low or no tariffs. Non-tariff means of exclusion, or else differential tariffs that preferred some countries over others, arent reflected here.The early period of high tariffs, incidentally, partially shows how dependent the US was on imported manufactures, since despite the high tariffs, such goods continued to be imported.I suspect the decline during the Civil War is also due to the blockade of the South, as the Morill Tariff significantly increased actual tariff rates.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"You have no idea what populism is, good to know.

The only reason red vs blue comes into it is that blue states tend to have a higher urban population and red states tend to have a higher rural population. And urban populations have more high wage earners than rural areas. Of course, there's more than just infrastructure.

That is especially true when compared to the various European mercantilist empires, whether Spain, Britain, France, or Portugal, which typically protected their colonies and mainlands through a system known as imperial preference. Neomercantilism also had some advocates in individuals like Friedrich List, and Metternicht promoted free trade within the German-speaking worldbut not withoutas a means of strengthening German nationhood. Protectionism also proved popular in the 19th century in various Latin American nations, and later Italy and Japan (again).The US is also responsible for crafting most of the institutions of world trade, such as the WTO, and also for policies such as the most-favored-nation defaultism that prevent things like the aforementioned imperial preference.So it depends.

The first point is that you are free to say nearly anything you want to anyone you want for any reason you want in public. So, responding to something someone says in public is obviously permitted, but presumably thats not what you mean. What youre asking is whether or not it is a social norm and would be viewed as acceptable by others. The answer to that is going to depend on the situation. Id draw a distinction. First there is a person truly declaring something for those who are present, as a public statement of some sort, in the sense that theyre speaking to the room. That definitely invites public comment. The person has inserted themselves into a space and attempted to get everyones attention. They should be prepared that some of those people may respond to that. But the scenario you offer isnt like that. The speaker is making a statement to one other person in particular, and you just happen to be standing there. So, by responding to them it is actually you who is inserting yourself into the situation in order to get *their* attention. They werent seeking your attention. So, in that case, youre free to insert yourself and attempt to get a conversation going with them. But theyre also perfectly free to refuse to engage with you, which is basically what the person did in your scenario. I wasnt talking to you didnt mean that it was wrong for you to respond because that violates some social rule. It was them saying I dont want to talk about this with you at this time. Thats their right, they dont owe you an ongoing conversation in the line at a coffee shop.","title":"CMV: If you make a statement out loud in public, you invite comment."},{"text":"[In the New Year's Eve program, Marcin Rola did not only fantasize about \\"fucking in the ass\\".

They had superior tactics - which the USA might, also, as its military apparatus has been more sophisticated, for longer - but the myth of Nazi technological superiority has been post-facto generated to, among other things, explain the rational for operation paper clip.Not really. They had better tech in plenty of regards, they just largely lacked the ability to manufacture it. I am not talking about unmanufactured weapons but the stuff they actually made.  Operation Paper Clip for instance was over the V2 rocket, and the V2 rocket was truly unparalleled. ...but they didnt have the resources to manufacture rockets in large enough quantities to do anythingThe T34 was hardly a technical marvel either, the Nazis could have manufactured those at any time. They were in strategic alliance with Rheinmetal setting up the Butast shell company in the Soviet Union from 1929 to 1941 specifically for involvement for tank weapons systems. The T34 was a pretty simple tank too. But the Nazis had a different mindset for producing the tanks - higher quality less in number - and the T34 was largely only a program in the Soviet Union due to American support - most of the fuel for the T34 came from the USA up into the end of the war, a large chunk of the steel came from the USA, and they didnt actually make that many until the later years of the war so the American lend-lease program was necessary to defend the supply chains to get the program going. The Germans had massive steel and fuel shortages, a tank based around producing as many as possible as fast as possible is fundamentally based around a plentiful supply of steel, so it just wasnt a viable idea for the Germans. If you want to see the practical level of difference in technical ability, go look at the sheet metal stamping on the M3 grease gun vs the STG44. The Russians only started doing stamped receivers on AK47s in 1957 despite that being the intent since 1947, and that is a much simpler stamping than the STG44.","title":"CMV: China will win a war against the US"},{"text":"Have you got a link?","title":"Theory: Both NOLA &amp; Trump Vegas Drivers Were Already Dead, The Electric Trucks Were Remote Driven By US/Israeli Intelligence"},{"text":"Yep, but they'll insist it must exist - because that's what the mainstream media said or because they want to believe it, etc.?","title":"Theory: Both NOLA &amp; Trump Vegas Drivers Were Already Dead, The Electric Trucks Were Remote Driven By US/Israeli Intelligence"},{"text":"[/r/neoliberal/new](/r/neoliberal/new): [Biden decides to block U.S. Steel sale to Nippon Steel: reports](/r/neoliberal/comments/1hsk4kw/biden_decides_to_block_us_steel_sale_to_nippon/)*Replies to this comment will be removed, please participate in the linked thread*","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Add Dr Umar","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"this isnt relevant but I always really liked that Americans think their gas prices will be cheaper when the US drills more since for some reason with oil everyone forgets that we sell to the entire globe and increasing our producing has an incredibly marginal effect.It's like everyone just forgets everything they know about American companies as soon as it comes to oil.","title":"Biden to Ban More Offshore Oil Drilling Before Trump Arrives"},{"text":"In other news, Biden to clog all toilets at the White House on inauguration day.","title":"Biden to Ban More Offshore Oil Drilling Before Trump Arrives"},{"text":"Unless a judge decides it can't be reversed.

There's no other politician who can provoke this much passion from Democrats: | Glenn Greenwald"},{"text":" As a democrat whose parents came here on H1B, built a life here, and became citizens I find this subreddits turn on highly paid immigrants has been disgusting. How to put this.... as painful as this is to hear, America, if anything has an over-glut of domestically educated American workers in most fields that require higher educations. There's some fields that are just always going to require immigrants to fill in higher educated positions, but its not most of them. What is being discussed is the policy of massively expanding the H1B program to increase both how many educated immigrants can come in, displacing Americans from already oversaturated job markets, and driving pay of the average worker in those fields down. This has been historically what has happened every single time the H1B program has been expanded (by Republicans, I might add) in the past.Immigration is not a feature of foreign and domestic policy that a nation engages in out of the goodness of their own heart. It is a tool to address demographic and economic shortfalls in labor market of a nation, and to address the decline of population growth in more educated populations. As cold as this sounds.... America doesn't really need educated immigrants.Our vacancies in the labor market are specifically in the lower paying sectors, which college educated Americans (44% of people over 25 by the way) generally do not want to perform. America has one of the highest levels of college educated citizens in the world, we are in the top 10 most educated populaces on the planet. H1B visas were historically meant for attracting people from abroad into fields that are highly competitive and we can't always have enough domestic talent, like engineering etc.So, in knowing we have too many educated workers to even have enough jobs for them to fill, are among the most college educated populaces in the world, and have a glut of unfilled labor at the lower end of the labor market, does it seem like sound policy to further crowd out domestic talent? Or does it seem like a way to, in some way, further drive down wages, which has been the intent every single time a Republican has ever expanded the H1B visa system.American immigration policy has and will always be about, American socioeconomic interest; it is not something we do just because. It is something we do because it benefits us as a society to allow people to come to this country, and to work here, as long as they aren't actually crowding out American workers from positions we already have enough labor. So as harsh as this sounds, yeah no, the H1B visa system absolutely must not be further expanded, as its not in the interest of American workers, society or economics to do so; and those are the only factors a nation's leaders should be concerned about, when making policy, as cold as that is.This isn't about who is coming, this is about who is already here, namely, US citizens, who can already fill those jobs.","title":"Bernie Sanders says Elon Musk is wrong about H-1B visas: 'Low-wage indentured servants'"},{"text":"Their cognitive dissonance is really kicking in when a MAGArsehole terrorist is a \\"liberal\\" terrorist!

Construction, Farming, law enforcement etc. are sectors that the GOP loves to exploit. The difference I think between the USA and Australia is that they dont have to make things easier on people like farmers to get their adoration. For example, the GOP has aided and abetted the monopolization of the agriculture industry, but most of the small time farmers always on the brink of losing the farm (because of this) are so far up the rear end of the GOP they know what Trump had for breakfast. The only industry I see the GOP going out of their way to promote is the police.

As a commenter pointed out above, it is true that there is visa fraud (usually in IT and from the big contractor firms), but there is a large swath of H1B outside of IT that is not fraudulent and used to fill high paying jobs that are very selective and difficult to get into. This may be a bitter pill to swallow but the pool of **qualified** candidates for these jobs is a lot smaller than laypeople imagine. For any given role, I (and my recruiter) would have to go through more than a thousand resumes of anyone and everyone who applies (both Americans and foreigners) to find maybe 50 that were worth pursuing for an initial phone screen. And out of those 50, maybe 5 would pass to actual interviews, and one would get an offer. Throughout the process, people were cut only for technical ability (and sometimes personality fit), never for salary or deportability or cost reduction reasons. So the whole process is truly blind to whether you are American or not. In fact, all things being equal it is a disadvantage to be a foreigner because the H1B is difficult to get and not a certainty. So if we had enough qualified Americans with the right technical skill sets to fill all roles, we might not ever need to look outside. But at these high levels of technical skills, there simply arent enough Americans. Period. The problem is in the pipeline. There arent enough Americans graduating in STEM disciplines, especially with advanced degrees which many of these roles either require or prefer. And if you look at any graduate program in the country, most of the students pursuing advanced degrees are foreigners- mainly from India and china. And these two countries also get the most H1B visas. This is not a coincidence. If we want to get more Americans into these roles, we have to work starting with the education pipeline. You cant work from the top down.","title":"Bernie Sanders says Elon Musk is wrong about H-1B visas: 'Low-wage indentured servants'"},{"text":"what's 20 years, amiright","title":"Biden discussed plans to strike Iran nuclear sites if Tehran speeds toward bomb"},{"text":"Free Palestine ?","title":"Americans: Vote and save our democracy!

Its a risk that Im personally briefing the incoming team on, Mr Sullivan said, adding that he had consulted with US ally Israel.He said that given Irans weakened state, Mr Trump could also persuade Iran to commit to dismantling its nuclear capacity.The president-elect is reportedly?considering airstrikes on Irans nuclear facilities?when he returns to the White House later this month.Mr Trump has told Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, in recent calls that he is concerned about Iran achieving nuclear capability,?The Wall Street Journal reported.Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz, Mr Trumps nominees for secretary of state and national security adviser, have consistently taken hardline stances on Iran.Mr Netanyahu has long called for Irans nuclear programme to be stopped in its tracks but has faced resistance from Israeli military officials and Washington.**Full story:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/01/02/biden-discussed-plan-strike-iran-nuclear-trump-inauguration/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/01/02/biden-discussed-plan-strike-iran-nuclear-trump-inauguration/)","title":"Joe Biden 'discussed plans to strike Iran nuclear sites before Donald Trump's inauguration'"},{"text":"I see comments like yours, then agree","title":"Cheney cheered as Biden awards her the Presidential Citizens Medal"},{"text":"We may be outnumbered, but there are many of us that appreciate skepticism about ALL sides...

I used to put the onus of the blame on the university education departments, some of which have been truly off the chart in stupidity (just check out that new New math rubbish that several states have been pushing and /or what they call \\"discovery science\\").Still, we CAN see some patterns. Here's the key conundrum: study after study has shown a strong correlation between parental education level and children's school achievement. It's almost 1 to 1. And higher educational level correlates, in turn with higher socio-economic standing, hence the add'l correlation between parental wealth/income and educational achievement.So the failure of education overall really boils down to the endemic, ever increasing inequality in this country.

There's also the struggle of dealing with loss and grief. So basically the government of Samoa is still dealing with the effects, monitoring the survivors and more. But the health scares did spur the Samoan government to declare a state of emergency and implement a mass mandatory vaccination campaign that to date has been very successful, with vaccination rates increasing from 28% to 94%. Parents now actively look to vaccinate their children, so the goal is to reach over 95% this year. As for RFK Jr., his CHD antivax foundation is not actually a charity group. They only spend money on videos and ad campaigns to get people to stop vaccinating or drinking fluoride, and spend money to lobby legislatures to support anti-vaccine/fluoride/HIV medication/5G legislation/bans. They do not actually donate money to help the victims of their lies.

I'm sure academics will take a few decades to come around, but Biden has accomplished very little and done a lot of damage. His biggest policies are by and large defined by being performative instead of actually having an impact. Maybe that will change over the coming years, but I doubt it. Too often Biden was more than happy to play to the absolute worst of the Democratic impulses. Obviously US foreign policy has been by and large a disaster class these last 4 years from Afghanistan to Israel/PA, Iran, Yemen, Lebanon and ofc Ukraine, the perhaps most clearest examples of the performative nature of Bidens administration. You can't go around stating that the invasion is a critical threat to the west, then repeatedly refuse and delay critical aid as Ukrainian soldiers are being slaughtered. I'd give him credit for China, but can't really do that given it's basically 90% Trumps policies being continued.Covid can be summed up in two words, school closures. The failure of the Biden administration to promote even minimal cost-benefit analysis will be felt for a decade in the american school system, especially among the less privileged. The absurdity of keeping US schools closed in some cases for more than a year after they had been opened in the rest of the West can not be overstated. It was not a science based approach to covid (public policy is science along with epidemiology), it was just a partisan impulse to do the opposite of what Republicans wanted. And I really don't believe the soft landing can be attributed to the Biden adminstration, who spent the first year of inflation attacking anyone calling attention to it publicly, repeatedly suggesting it was purely \\"transitory\\" and would not seriously impact the price level in the long run, then shifting towards denying the impact inflation has had under the guise of his \\"strong\\" economy.

We dont attempt to shut down or threaten those who tell these jokes, we just continue on as usual. Islam on the other hand is never joked about. Instead, only the virtues of it are expressed.

Building the interstate highway system gets Eisenhower credit, maintaining it doesn't register for anyone.Finally, his term is going to be defined by what Trump does. If you're attempting to be dismissive of Biden, its pretty easy to say that anyone would have beaten Trump coming off of COVID. Then obviously you follow up with how he shouldn't have run, and is therefore responsible for what Trump does next. If its bad, we'll have that photo of him smiling with a smug Trump in the Oval for our history books forever after he and his campaign asserted that Trump was a threat to democracy, but still good enough for a photo op apparently.Then you'll have the folks that bring up the soft landing in defense, which is remarkable but inflation went to 9% and that's bad.

Again, while this may have been the right move morally, it was terrible politically because it made Democrats look like corrupt hypocrites and legitimized one of Trump's talking points.Next Nancy Pelosi pulls some strings to get a no-name 74-year-old with throat cancer in as the top oversight committee Democrat (a highly visible position with significant communications duties), completely sidelining AOC (a proven communicator) for the role. Sure this may have been a tactical decision - put some random in charge as not to draw attention to yourself - but it simply reinforced beliefs within the party that young progressive voices are being suppressed in favor of old guard moderates. Once again, bad political optics.Then Biden casts a bunch of commutations and winds up commuting the sentence for the \\"kids 4 cash\\" judge (TL:DR private prison kickbacks in exchange for harsher juvenile sentences). Right-wing media attacks the move as being soft on crime, Left-wing media attacks the move as ill-informed and helping perpetuate a broken system. Yet again, Democrats suffer politically.Finally, we have Biden (and Democrats are large) parading around Liz Cheney like she's a great political martyr. Did she oppose Trump as a result of Jan. 6th and face excommunication from Republican circles as a result? Yes. Did she happily go along with Trump's agenda prior to Jan. 6th? Yes. Would her and her family benefit greatly from establishment Democrats continuing to greenlight arms shipments to Ukraine and Israel? Yes. Would she have happily gone back to obstructing the Democratic party agenda if Trump had been defeated? Most likely. Putting all that aside, though, the political framing is horrible. The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan was a low point for the Biden administration, despite it being necessary and long overdue. Hanging around with the daughter of Dick Cheney (commonly seen as the architect of our 20 year wars in the Middle East) only serves to remind people of that low point, and only further divides party elites from party members.Where did we go wrong, and why does it feel like Democratic party elites have decided to cash in their chips and rake up what they can before Trump's oligarchs take their cut? Don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting we go back to the \\"when they go low, we go high\\" mentality that got Clinton speared in 2016, but maybe these things should be run past an analyst before they get greenlit? It just feels like the Overton window for the party's leadership is at a different place than the party's members, which may very well be at a different place than the country's population. I don't know how we fix this but I hope we figure it out quickly, because the next four years will be relentless and Democrats need a consistent, party-unifying, and country-convincing narrative to run in 2026 and 2028 with.If you made it this far, thank you for reading my rant.

Sanders already has a solid contingent of younger progressives in office to carry the torch for him. He has already accomplished his lifes work by raising issues others were too afraid to raise, pulling the party left, and inviting more young people into the political process. He can and should retire with dignity. He got the process started, and I thank him for it, but its time to let the next generation have its turn. He would honestly be able to do so much more with what remaining time he has by grooming the career of someone like AOC than remaining in the Senate, where he will accomplish absolutely nothing. He should also start thinking about who he might endorse as his replacement in the Senate and get that persons name out. But staying in office is probably the least productive thing he could do.

She was going to lose to Giuliani until he backed out.Then she ran for President, and despite full throated DNC support, lost to some rando from Illinois.The DNC got together to figure it out and said, well people said she had no real foreign experience, so let's get her some by making her Secretary of State despite having no real credentials for it.Then, in 2016, she said it was her turn, and the DNC went farcical making sure another Obama didn't happen.Turns out, she was still incredibly un-electable, and lost to a reality TV star, and takes no fucking blame for it.She was being groomed and pushed to be President since at least 1998, and despite the majority of the country making it very clear they didn't want her, decided it was her time.

Delusional.Idk if y'all are just paid or ignorant, or just too young, but this place has such a tenuous grasp on the reality of Hilary Clinton's career.Like, is the smear campaign the emails?

Is it her calling Monica Lewinsky an adult in defending her husband taking advantage of being the President of the USA to seduce a college intern?  She said it.

If the comment could be seen as rude/offensive, especially when about those around them and/or loud, like \\"ugh, these Mexicans are always so disruptive\\" or \\"god, I hate people dressed like that\\", I would say they are inviting comment. Don't dish it if you can't take it, and all that.However, if the comment is simple personal preference, like \\"eh, I don't think I want Chinese food tonight\\" or \\"I personally like that plushie more\\", and especially if it's relatively quiet, then I think it'd be rude to try to argue with them. Imagine, for example, if a couple was discussing their upcoming wedding plans at a cafe. Just because they're there quietly discussing who to invite doesn't mean they are inviting those around them into a discussion.This is a spectrum, of course, and even benign comments about current events, especially controversial/divisive ones, might illicit responses. But then you have to ask yourself why you're responding in the first place and how disruptive your own response is getting. A single comment on what was said is usually fine, but trying to engage this woman in a full debate could be what was considered rude. As a member of a minority who used to be constantly roped into arguments about said minority simply for existing, there are times when you just really don't want to debate about something, even casually. While the woman might have been a bit inconsiderate of others to bring up the topic, your attempts to debate her were obviously not something she wanted, and if the topic/comment is controversial enough to illicit comment, a continued discussion of the matter was likely making others around you guys uncomfortable. And let's be real, if the woman feels confident enough in her controversial opinion to voice it in a crowded public place, you aren't going to get her to see the flaws in her view from a simple two-minute conversation while the barista makes your coffees.","title":"CMV: If you make a statement out loud in public, you invite comment."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(t=>setTimeout(t,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},j={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],O={key:0},U={key:1};function N(t,a,e,c,r,s){const m=w("PoemCard");return i(),o("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=n("div",{class:"top-banner"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 public opinion 🥳")])],-1)),n("div",j,[(i(!0),o(b,null,v(s.visiblePoems,(l,p)=>(i(),k(m,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(i(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...l)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(i(),o("span",U,"Loading...")):(i(),o("span",O,"See more"))],8,E)):x("",!0)])}const J=d(W,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-e827fc22"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/27.md","filePath":"quotes/27.md"}'),P={name:"quotes/27.md"},z=Object.assign(P,{setup(t){return(a,e)=>(i(),o("div",null,[u(J)]))}});export{R as __pageData,z as default};
