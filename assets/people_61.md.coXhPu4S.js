With the Hebrews slaves to Egypt for 400 years and then with 40 years wandering in the desert, it was embedded in the foundation of the faith to be welcoming and kind to foreigners. There are wildly high number of verses and stories both in the Old and New Testament that touch on it. Way more than any references to the sanctity of unborn life - or even right to weapons.? And on that note, how many of the people crossing the border are our brothers and sisters in Christ? Should we dehumanize them and cage them and separate their families for doing something that we would probably also try to do if our kids were facing the same risks? Is it OK to cage a child, any child? Is it OK to cage a mothers child who might call out to the same God as you do?? On our faith family, how often have we thought about our Arab Christian brothers and sisters? Have we considered how America can make sure they are doing okay - along with being a force for good for all people?? We live in a democracy. This is not a \\"King Darius\\" situation (using an ungodly king for good), because we are part of the government - not under the government. We have a part in choosing who will lead us.? Your vote is your witness. By the church taking on a political pursuit, the church has successfully made Trump the brand. Nonbelievers' interaction with you is in the political sphere. Ask anyone outside of the evangelical church their top three things they think about evangelicals, and Trump most likely will be one of them. Is this who should represent our faith? Is he worthy of the sacrifice of the church's message?? Jesus repeatedly refused to take over government control. It is also not what Paul or Peter or John pursued. Why are we trying to do to America what Jesus or New Testament leaders did not pursue?? As Christians, we are called to love, to sacrifice, to walk in humility - not to grow our political power as an expression of faith.? America is not the promised land. It is a gift we currently have been given, and we must respond in love. Not by abandoning the core tenants of our faith by mocking people or punching down.? It is completely unbiblical to hoard wealth or to mistreat workers for financial gain.? Holding onto fear (\\"America will be horrible if he doesn't win\\") and hate (\\"the fascist communists want to destroy America; they are the enemy within\\") is the opposite of Christianity. We dont need to fear the future. We need to focus on loving God and loving others. Faith counters fear; love counters hate or apathy.? In terms of gender identity, what do you think about the person who helped Esther for a year to get ready to meet the king and help with fashion and beauty? And in terms of one husband-one wife guidelines in the New Testament from Paul, do you think that someones sexual activity was the most important factor in how God viewed them throughout the entire Bible? Think of some of the biblical greats, and how many had that standard.? The Democrats have done some awful things, but so have the Republicans. Neither can claim a Christ approved stamp. So much of the instability in Latin America to rough the 1900s (that also caused the murdering of priests and babies) was done by the so-called Gods party.? Outlawing abortion does not stop abortion. Some of the countries with the highest rates of abortion are those with laws against abortion, If you want abortion rates to go down, you need to focus more on why women feel desperate (outside of health-based decisions - but also help with health). How about the church focus on supporting young families, building a community, and protecting women and children from abuse instead?? God does not need Trump. God is bigger than problems in front of us. Can you imagine saying to God that only you can fix a problem?? It is unbiblical to add more words to the scriptures. That would include things like the constitution and pledge of allegiance to the Bible. Those are pillars of our government, which is different than our religion.?The more the white evangelical church idolizes political power, wealth, and prestige, the more we run from the words and life of Jesus. We are poisoning the church. We need to enter into a season healing, return to the churchs roots of love and service. To return to caring for the most vulnerable. Then people will know Jesus through our works and through our fruits at the spirit, such as patience, kindness, faith, love, gentleness, and joy.?Please, my brothers and sisters, God is not a white Republican. And we need to follow Jesus, not Trump. As Christians, Trump does not deserve our allegiance or worship. Sure, you can vote for him as an American, but you don't have to vote for him as a Christian. There is a silent majority who misses Christians who stood for goodness no matter what, instead of transactional trading of values for power. Please let us all be open to understanding the suffering of our neighbors, and to use our power to respond in love.","title":"How faith is shaping evangelical Christian voters views of Trump and Harris"},{"text":"Just go ahead and call her a bitch you fucking coward.","title":"Trump at final rally hints at profane insult of Pelosi that starts with a b"},{"text":"Talking about them being blithering idiots.

Christianity does not mean you have to vote Republican or for Trump.?I used to think like you, and I had the credits to back up my authority.(Heavily active in the evangelical church my entire childhood. Went to Christian college, where I earned my MRS with a guy Im still with who was similarly committed. Helped my father start a church. And more. I was involved in churches my adult life until 2016 when Trump was elected.)?Here are things I learned in my journey from my biblical perspective.?? Character matters. Think of the parable of the talents. If someone wastes their talents, power, or wealth, should they be given more? Also, we have an entire book of Proverbs that describes a fool and wise person. Do you think someone who says whatever insults come to his mind and chase any pretty lady and explode in anger if things dont go his way, would be described as a wise leader?? Trump escaping death this year does not mean hes necessarily divinely appointed to be president. It could also mean he is the beast from Revelations 13 (if we want to look at this biblically, one of the heads of the beast seemed to have a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was astonished and followed the beast)?? Jesus saved his fiercest anger for those who used the temple or religion as a place to grow their prestige or wealth. I could say that those who use Christianity for power or wealth fall in that same category.? Women can be leaders. There are fierce leaders throughout the Bible who are women, think of Deborah, Jael, Esther, and Lydia. You could also say that the first 3 women were divinely appointed to bring relief to their people.? Taking care of nature and animals should be our core essence as we worship the creator God. We should be good stewards of what were given.? The love for others is of most importance. And when we get into?the territory of thinking that some groups deserve love and some groups deserve judgment, is when we start stepping outside of the core message of Christianity.(Continued to part 2)","title":"How faith is shaping evangelical Christian voters views of Trump and Harris"},{"text":"Hey doesnt that one look like Ann?","title":"Trump Completely Forgets Where He Is After Mocking Mitch McConnell"},{"text":"I saw a still a Trump girl! bumper sticker several months ago.","title":"Trump Ends Campaign by Calling Female Leader the B-Word"},{"text":"Baseless name calling.

There are band aids which Dems have been trying to apply. The issue stems from a lack of men who are willing to be teachers. Even in countries with good salaries for teachers, that gap still exists. If you want that to change, you need a ground movement to encourage far more men to go into public education (especially in the primary and secondary levels).You know what makes things far worse though? When teachers are paid poorly. When conservatives are consistently attacking public education.Refer to the list of things to address, to find a list of things to address.Already have, so go address them.I say \\"dems have to do better for men so more men vote for them\\" and somehow that is controversial.Your top men's issues are education and mental health.

At least own that point of yours rather than pretending we're missing some point of yours which you can never qualify.

Some people are starting to come around to the idea that the party needs fundamental changes to maintain relevancy but sadly others think everything is fine.  Admittedly it took me nearly a decade to realize the rot at the top of the party, particularly in state leadership but once I realized it, it was terribly difficult to ignore and ultimately lead to my complete withdrawal from leadership, volunteering, donating and campaign management as I really was just trying to piss upwind and getting nowhere.    Now granted a lot of the Democratic Party issues are leadership, but they do have policy positions that don't make sense as well (Israel for example).  Republican's on the other hand are crazy good at organizing and their leadership (of their party) is well organized, it's just their policy positions are absolutely horrendous and they have this unending game of who can be the largest asshole they can't seem to get over.  This is why I say both are broken, just in different ways. One is obviously worse than the other but they're both still in need of a lot of work if either of them want to stay relevant and in the case of Republicans, in existence. \\nSorry if this was a bit rambling, I've been up for almost 24hrs and can't sleep due to election anxiety.","title":"Im a Republican for Harris, but Democrats have big problems that victory wont fix"},{"text":"Yes and he did 3 years in prison.","title":"Shock as Trump says putting Harris in the ring with Mike Tyson would be interesting"},{"text":"Trump's latest attack on Pelosi is beyond the palepetty, reckless, and just plain ugly.

The Democrats are not elitist as a group (of course some are, just like in the GOP), but the GOP has definitely managed to present them as such to a large chunk of the population.The Democrats must find a way to stop letting the GOP define them to that part of the population. I wonder for example what would happen if Harris, after being elected, presents a Democratic program that will really help the working class and then instead of just sending it to Congress, and instead of waiting for the next election, goes on say a 100 day tour of the Rustbelt and beyond to explain it to people.

Yeah.A study on male suicide revealed that 70% of men that took their lives contacted support in the month before they did it, and 80% were marked as low or no risk of suicide.Contacting a suicide helpline is not the same as having access to actual mental healthcare, especially early on.Biden and Harris have worked to expand such mental healthcare access, notably by increasing mental health services. Do you know who opposed that? Republicans did.https://truthout.org/articles/205-republicans-vote-against-bill-to-expand-school-mental-health-services/Reminder: actions speak louder than words.And I'm not entirely sure what Vance has to do with anythingTrump and Vance are **actually attacking women**. There is nothing comparable when it comes to the other side is the whole point that you keep wanting to sidestep.I'm saying that the dems need to do better to get more men to vote for them.How aren't they? Why don't you give a specific piece of policy that Dems are ignoring specifically for men?I posted a list of issues somewhere in the thread, I'm not gonna write it all again.Education is failing both men and women. You need more men in public education to be positive role models for boys. The best way you'll do that is by paying teachers more. Dems support that, Republicans don't.The family court argument is a myth. Men are not disadvantaged in family court. Fathers are simply not requesting custody as often as mothers do.

They provide interpreters if needed and local transportation to and from clinics and airports. At no cost to the women.The Democrats screwed the American people over with regard to abortion. They had 5 decades to codify Roe into permanent federal law. But they never did. They used the issue to convince people to always vote for a Democrat president. They used the issue to maintain political power. I can prove it. Democrats legalized same sex marriage by passing a bill that Biden signed in 2022 (many Republicans also supported the bill). Seven years after the Oberfelt case. They were afraid the Supreme Court would overturn that case. So, again. Why didn't they do the same for abortion? We are in this situation because of Democrats.

The case claims that members of Congress, Vice President Mike Pence, and other federal officials violated their oaths of office by certifying the election results without adequately investigating reported allegations of election irregularities and fraud. The Brunsons argue that this failure compromised the integrity of the election process and, by extension, the security of the United States.  \\n  \\nThe case seeks to have those officials removed from office for allegedly breaching their constitutional duty to protect the country. The argument hinges on the claim that officials did not thoroughly assess claims of fraud, which the plaintiffs believe posed a risk to national security.

They have not managed to meaningfully undo the decades of neoliberal policy that led us to this place despite talking an awful lot about hope and change.Regardless, when we look at how working class voting seems divorced from the policies that seem most likely to benefit them, we have to wonder why they would do that.  Is it that they are simply unable to determine what policies benefit them?  That's an education issue and the Dems could fix that over time if the GOP are on board (they probably aren't).  Is it that they are prioritizing other political issues higher?  That's tough because it's so subjective, but perhaps the disappearance of Trump would help reset the discourse and let us focus on real issues again.

The reason why poor people have no such opportunities is because they can't compete against companies in politically oppressive countries where labor and cost of living is cheaper. Also, there is too much regulation which prevents people from getting started. People need to be able to sell products that are 'rough around the edges' in the beginning before they can get good.Tariffs would take foreign competitors out of the picture and thus create opportunities locally. Of course they won't be as efficient as the Chinese, in the beginning, but even then, it's still better than what's happening in the west where people are forced into unemployment or bullshit white-collar office jobs which add no value or negative value... Where they are totally replaceable and operating under the thumb of their bosses who outsource all the real valuable work to Asia. This is not a good long term solution.Also, would it really harm poor people? Look at what is most expensive to poor and middle-class people today... Is it their toothbrush? Is it toilet paper? Their toaster? No! What takes the most out of people's incomes are taxes and rent. Why is rent so damn expensive? Because people who own the overseas factories are buying up all the properties and driving up the prices! Then because the locals are in such a bad negotiating position, they have no choice but to pay up whatever the landlord asks!Also, the thing about goods is that you can do without most of them! Or you can substitute for a cheaper alternative. You cannot do without a roof over your head!What about food? Food is kind of expensive these days right? But how will tariffs make food more expensive? Fresh food has a short shelf life and must be produced locally so tariffs will only block out foreign, highly processed foods that are stuffed with preservatives. Is that a problem? No.","title":"Trump says Federal Taxes are a scam.

Let's say that 10 companies make a widget for sale in America. Trump puts a 50% tariff on foreign widgets. Let's say before he did they were sold to distributors for 100 dollars a piece and they sold them directly to consumers for 120 bucks. One of the 10 companies makes them in America and sold them for 120 and barely made a profit.Now the tariffs make the item sell for 100 bucks and 50% tariff tax.  So the foreign company now would have to sell it for 100 bucks and pay 50 bucks in tax which would be a loss. So instead they would sell it for 200 dollars and pay 100 in tax meaning they still sell it for  the same profit.  9 companies now sell it for 200 bucks and the distributors now need to sell that for 220 bucks to make the same profit.The one American company will see theirs are for sale at 120 bucks and everyone else's is 220. So they will raise their price to maybe 160 and the American people now can buy that one brand for 180 bucks. But the stores notice this and they might sell theirs for 200 to get more profit.\\nEither way that tariff is being paid by Americans.","title":"Trump favors huge new tariffs.

I noticed that only about 1% were independents, while nearly everyone else was either a registered Democrat or Republican. This wasnt about how they voted, but about what they are registered as. So, 99% of people were registered with either the Democratic or Republican party.What does this mean? Does being registered as a Democrat or Republican mean you are officially part of that party? Does it mean thats what you voted in the last election? Do they ask your political preference when you register? Im a bit confused.In the Netherlands (Europe), you can join a political party to support them, but you sont havr to. only about 15-20% of people are actually \\"registered\\" with a party. And we have like 10 parties instead of just two. Most people dont join a party; they just vote for the one they believe in.Also, why does the government in the U.S. care what party youre registered with? That seems a bit weird to me. In the Netherlands, the government doesnt know or need to know if youve joined a certain party. All they care about is how many votes each party gets. They have no way of knowing how many voters are registered as x.Maybe Im misunderstanding what it means to be a \\"registered\\" Democrat or Republican. Can someone explain?","title":"What Does Being \\"Registered\\" as a Democrat or Republican Mean in America?"},{"text":"You genuinely have heard a significant portion of women in America claim they have it as bad as under Sharia Law in certain countries? Or are you saying simply that you use the existence of worst places to be dismissive of potentially legitimate concerns women in America face?It's really hard for me to believe the answer to the first question isn't \\"no,\\" and that what's happening for you is that you feel like your personal calibrations for what constitutes valid complaining cause you to think women here are \\"over-reacting\\" to the scaling back of abortion rights?What really irks me about seeing guys make this intellectual move is that it basically implies that you know better than American women themselves how much \\"complaining\\" is warranted by the hardships or dangers they face as women. Another problem I see from a critical thinking standpoint with respect to adopting the posture of \\"you're complaining too much about this, look at this other place where women *truly* have it rough\\" is that it indefensibly implies that women in America weren't aware of their advantages to compared to, say, the lives of women in Saudis Arabia. Nobody said that American women have it worse or equally bad. You're just using that point to be dismissive. Conversations about women's rights in America don't have to wait until every worse place is improved.\\"I don't have to take you women here as seriously as you want me to about abortion rights because, after all,  look how worse women have it somewhere else!\\" This also implies that you know better than American women about this worst place such that you're a better judge than they are over how much complaining is or isn't warranted. The world isn't a contest to see who has it worst, where only the winner is allowed to complain. Empathy isn't exactly a zero sum game. Thus, when your rights as a man might feel de-prioritized or stepped on, it's perfectly valid to speak up about your concerns and feelings rather than staying quiet because men in the past had it tougher or men somewhere else have it worst.Lastly, I just wanted to return to the implication in your comments that American women discussing their unhappiness over their rights being scaled back somehow renders YOU some kind of fairer arbiter of who gets to complain and about what, and who understands the plight of women in countries with even worse women's rights than in the US. Specifically, the points/question I'd like to pose is whether you think it's possible that women might not need to be reminded that other women have it worse? Not because you aren't allowed to or shouldn't bring up a potentially perfectly valid point comparing women's struggles elsewhere. But because they are women and are likely able to relate at least as well as (and likely far more than) you and I can relate to women in Saudi Arabia. Do you think perhaps that women in America can care about their rights AND be knowledgeable about and earnestly empathetic toward women who have it even worse? After all, wouldn't seeing their rights scaled back here make it even easier for them to concern themselves with the range of experiences women have from a rights standpoint around the world?","title":"CMV: American women have it amazing."},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/owmdzqxey1zd1.jpeg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88cda757d2f39b86ffbda11cbfe0f0be27a38c7e","title":"A vote for 3rd party is a vote for Trump."},{"text":"Not yet project 2025 anyone?","title":"CMV: American women have it amazing."},{"text":"Hes a means to an end.

If you look at the history, many counties like Itasca, and Swift county, have been hardcore Democrats counties, but swung heavily to Trump and maintained the momentum in both elections. I'm talking about the counties that refused to back Nixon and Reagan in their landslide back in the 72 and 84. For the first time after more than 100 years, Trump is the most Union friendly Republican they ever had in politics, and given that the Democratic Party is heavily becoming Neoliberal, this state is moving non stop to the Republican Party. It has voted 10 points for Obama in 2008, down to 7.2 points in 2012 and down to 7.0 points in 2020 with an exception of 2016 when Hillary Clinton even failed to secure more than 50% of the vote due to split in third party share. This state has been moving towards the right side of the political spectrum and even against the trend of the nation.Walz? Picking him as a running mate doesn't guarantee a victory in a home state, especially when we are talking about Presidential Election when policy matters. Remember, Adlai Stevenson lost his home state of Illinois twice to Eisenhower, a Kansas man and Nixon, a Californian.Right now, the only reason why Trump is still struggling in the state is because of the twin cities, in which he lost a lot of suburban votes, but suburban voters are swing voters and they aren't solid blue voters, the only thing Trump needs to do is to improve his performance in the suburbs. He still has a lot of room to grow in the Iron Range, like Duluth area, Carlton county, Lake county and especially Saint Louis county, this county alone has swung 14 points towards Trump since 2012, which is a huge number for a lifelong Democrat county.And last but not least, Reagan got close to 0.18 points in the state in a landslide National R +23 election.Trump got close to 1.5 points in the state in a tight race National D +3 election. Trump's performance in the state is at least 20 times better than Reagan.The reason why the Republican Party had performed terribly in MN was because they had pursued Neoliberal policies for decades since the Reagan presidency and became hostile to Union workers. Trump was the one who broke it and brought a new fresh air to those people in MN and in the Rust Belt as a whole. That explains how Trump managed to break the blue wall despite losing in the National Popular vote.","title":"What are states you think will be upset and flipped red?"},{"text":"Yeah Bibi has own corruption investigation, He hangs to the PM position because once he's out he's back to court.","title":"Ivanka Trump posted 19-post thread on the eve of the election.

It is not okay that some states are allowed to ban women from receiving medical care under certain circumstances.**4. This isn't the end of the story.** Some Republican politicians, Republican doners, right-wing pundits and pseudointellectuals, and other right-wingers have expressed skepticism of women's right to vote and have floated banning certain kinds of birth control and banning no-fault divorce. Women fought hard for generations to get these rights and - somehow - in the last decade it has become politically feasible to consider revoking those rights. We do not currently live in a comic book dystopia, but it is absolute possible for the United States to become one if we do nothing to resist the efforts of these people.","title":"CMV: American women have it amazing."},{"text":"\\"he's an imperfect vessel!\\"","title":"My fellow Christians: What about Trumps behavior follows the example of Jesus?"},{"text":"The father could do that.

I do trust we have our own people on the inside to keep track of and later overturn any blatant fraud. After 2020 I like to imagine the right lawyers, white hat hacker types, high tier judges, undercover journalists and other fine people placed on this chess board to prevent a 2020 repeat.Honestly, Twitter being on The Left's side of the battlefield in 2020 was huge, more than the average citizen could comprehend. 1 major Internet social platform where mass public opinion is brewed + the help of FBI/state has the power alone to Win elections. Twitter was used to bury critical news stories, also falsely claim things even people with authority write as \\"disinformation\\" to censor conversation over topics the uni-party wants to control the narrative of (with the help of paid actors in Mainstream news who work for THEM not US) They even banned Trump lol. Imagine the leader of any other country having their voice silenced by a corporation - Thanks to Elon Musk we stole their most important cyber weapon. Mass population scale mind viruses can be used for both Good and Evil, depending on the sender and the message. Musk knows that \\"Freedom of Speech\\" as a constitutional right isn't protected within private companies, so he purchased the most invaluable company to resupply us with and protect us from losing that Freedom in the digital landscape where our voices have the biggest impact.

A website which is mostly used by humans who live outside of the USA + Bots. Nearly all the moderators here, for every single sub-reddit are Leftist activists. Whether the sub is The World of Warcraft or the Texas subreddit, the same \\"type\\" of person is in control there. Currently they are astroturfing the ever living shit out of Reddit trying to create the illusion Harris is so positive, popular and beloved while Donald Trump is (apparently) hated by this entire country. It's weird because if you take let's say 200 years of American history, I imagine those Americans of the past decades would have chosen Trump over Kamala 100% of the time. Like it or not, he embodies USA and always has. \\"Kamala,\\" as an idea, is a foreign ideology to our nation - in all of US history \\nWhy do they control Reddit so obsessively in 2024, after losing X? It's a cope. Reddit does NOT have the reach of X/Twitter.

The author makes good points, but there's so much he could have expanded on. Trump is different from Jesus in a ton of ways.Sure, no one is perfect, but Trump is far away from Christlike behavior. I won't get into all the ways, but one thing is that Trump is full of pride. He has a ridiculously strong sense of pride, so much that he seems to be a narcissist. He's so full of himself, seeing himself as the greatest everything, the best at everything, someone who always wins, someone whose needs are always more important that everyone's. But Jesus constantly showed humility, doing servant-like things such as washing others' feet. And He allowed Himself to be mocked, tortured, and killed, because it was for a greater purpose.Trump can't comprehend the concept of being humble and putting others before oneself. He just doesn't understand that -- well, he chooses not to understand.

Years ago when Howard Stern asked her what her politics were, she said conservative on economics, liberal on social issues. She also said she voted for Trump in 2020 and 2024, and I assume that means she didn't in 2016.

The holy people will be delivered into his hands for a time, times and half a time.*This leads into *Daniel 8:25* He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior.The Bible predicts the Antichrist will be someone who negotiates powerful real estate deals with friends [predicts the Antichrist will be someone who negotiates powerful real estate deals with friends.](https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-39.htm)--Revelation 13 [very specifically tells us](https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-5.htm) that somewhere in the middle of his first three and a half years in office, the Antichrist will give a very specific and telling speech: he will arrogantly brag of his accomplishments and great things, and will also use Gods name in a way considered to be blasphemy.[Trump uses Lord's name in vain at NC rally](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/12/trump-evangelicals-blasphemy-profanity-1456178)Daniel 11:37-38 - He will show no regard for the gods of his ancestors or for the one desired by women, nor will he regard any god, but will exalt himself above them all.

If the actual gender gap is like in the early vote tallies in Georgia, North Carolina, and Iowa of 56 % women and 41-42% men, then the result will be different. And that's just *one* demographic.

Not one that advocates for equality.But that's not a discussion women, particularly female suprmicists, typically want to have. Gets into messy things like accountability and responsibility for their actions.For instance, if the man does not want the child, but has no say in whether it is brought to term for very good reasons of bodily autonomy, why is he not then allowed to abort his relationship with, claim to, or responsibility for that child he very often had had little or no say say in creating?And before you tell me about all the power and options he has here, perhaps you'd care to start by listing the number of male options for temporary birth control and it's average failure rate. Factor in capitalism.Then list the number of temporay birth control options women have available to them and their average failure rates. Then calculate the *combined* expected failure rate for preventing and/or stopping pregnancy of those options which can be used in concert by women.Now. Who is most responsible for and capable of preventing or halting an unwanted pregnancy? The man? Or the woman? Do you know what a 'Last Clear Chance' law is in regards to assigning culpability in say, auto accidents? It means that the person with the last clear chance to avoid the accident, but didn't take it, is responsible for it.Further, on these grounds, a man who is forced to sire a child against his will in this way, should be due damages and royalties from the mother, for the theft of his desirable heritable traits in perpetuity, that she at least clearly valued enough to steal from him, quite deliberately, given the options available to her to prevent it or stop it.This says *nothing* of the very common practice of outright, direct theft of sperm which is then used to impregnate without the man's involvement at all.Instead, the man is forced to pay her, as if she cannot make money for herself, (so much for doing away with anachronistic gender role expectations, eh?) upon pain of imprisonment, limiting of job and career options, curtailing his ability to find a better relationship, social stigma, among many, many other life-altering things.You see, many of us absolutely agree that the decision of whether or not to start or continue a pregnancy is something that by it's nature, belongs to the woman, just like it's her choices about whom she gives access to sex. We just aren't convinced you understand what that actually means.Because then we're gonna have to reassert our nature-given right and boundary to decide who gets access to relationships of any kind with us.","title":"Serious question: Are there any true supporters of Kamala on Reddit or are they all paid accounts?"},{"text":"I'm almost 100 percent confident but I worry due to election fraud.","title":"Who here is completely 100% confident that Trump will win tomorrow?"},{"text":"Seems to me, and I'm no economist... that a tariff on imports, is designed to goose the domestic market version, of that imported product.?\\nSay... textiles, durable goods, produce and meats, perhaps certain kinds of machines... you know, things you as a country make.?\\nIf you tariff stuff you don't make at home... are you just telling consumers not to buy those things period, if they are going to cost an arm and a leg now?\\nWhat about the insane amount of cheap plastic and manufactured components that companies IN the USA buy to make stuff they sell IN the USA?

So, if you have a vaccine, you have effectively taught your immune system what to look for and what antibody to produce to counter the virus if it finds it .   Every virus has an exposure threshold, think, the number of active viruses you would need to take on board before an infection would occur.  Once that is crossed, they are sufficient viruses to begin replication faster than your body can rally an immune response.  If you have never gotten the vaccine or the virus then your immune system has no head start as a result you get fully sick with a large amount of active virus  while your body learns to identify the threat and manufacture antibodies.Due to the viral load, more antibodies are needed to wipe out the virus. You can think of this in terms of an invading army.   The more soldiers (virus) that makes it into your body (and the more time they have to replicate there) the more of your own troops (your antibodies) you would need to muster to defeat the enemy. The virus has a head start and can run rampant. Thus, it takes a lot more antibodies to defeat the infection and for a period post infection, your plasma is rich in those antibodies sufficiently to be beneficial to a newly infected person.If you have the vaccine, your immune system is quicker to recognize the virus.  It also knows what antibodies to produce and can, therefore, spin up production faster. As a result, fewer antibodies are needed as the viral load is lower due to the shorter duration between infection and response.  Think stopping the invasion at the beach head instead of letting the invading army get a foot holdThe result is covalescent (recovered covid patient). Plasma that is insufficiently rich in antibodies to be certain to be therapeuticly beneficial.  Donors aren't banned because of a hazard to recipients, but because they can't be certain the resulting product would be beneficial. This is just another of those areas where facile understanding leads one to believe that something that is evidence against their position is actually the proof that they are right.  I'm speaking under the assumption that you believe the vaccine is dangerous, and this is some of the evidence. Hope this helps.","title":"And If You Ever Need Plasma, Hope You Have the Right Friends"},{"text":"Thank you for standing up for America!","title":"First Time Voter"},{"text":"Source?","title":"And If You Ever Need Plasma, Hope You Have the Right Friends"},{"text":"\\"You people disgust me!\\"\\"He's right!

Unfortunately even on this count they handed victories to the other side by supporting late term abortions - not always justifyably and without sufficient safeguards. OTOH, if we have full support for free speech, as Trump appears to say (not sure he'll be able to do it) then by definition the abortion debate will move to a higher level.Here's a trick question: in Russia, which is suffering from low birth rate there has been a serious turn against abortion on demand. Too many women used abortion as a form of birth control as it's become too easy. one consequence is that too many abortions can also compromise fertility. At least over there, in places like Russia there's serious debate on the issue as well as considerably more support for those who choose to have children.That last item, the children born unwanted is a very serious issue in this country. There are way too many \\"throw away\\" children (I personally know three such individuals. Parents just basically dumped them on foster care). We have too many born children with serious health complications, since the pregnancy was not well cared for or wanted.Why do I mention it here? because, as I said above, having true free speech means we can confront die hard republicans on this issue of unwanted and uncared for children and if we, as a whole did, they'd be forced to either come up with serious solution 9which they won't ) or they'll come around to the idea that sometimes abortion makes more sense than a compromised birth. not the religious ones of course.","title":"Serious question: Are there any true supporters of Kamala on Reddit or are they all paid accounts?"},{"text":"You turned into a very strong person.

At all.","title":"Shock as Trump says putting Harris in the ring with Mike Tyson would be interesting"},{"text":"I have a mildly different perspective on this.I suffered 7 strokes in a couple days last summer.  While I was in the hospital bed recovering, my wife created a Snapchat to \\"see what was out there.\\"  My wife has early onset Parkinson's, and I stood with her ever since she was diagnoses in 2019.  As last year went on, my job let me go while I was in the hospital recovering, and while I'm MOSTLY ok now, I haven't been able to get a new job.  As the end of 2023 came on, I became depressed.  In Jan 2024 I told my wife I was suicidal.  To help me, she decided it would be a good idea to start cheating on me 10 days later with her ex-BF.  We have been married for 18 years, have a 17 year old daughter, and her ex BF is a drug dealer who has convictions of soliciting hookers, child abandonment, bad checks, DUIs, etc etc.  He lives, of course, in Florida.    My wife starts cheating on me.  I find out about it as she keeps going to Florida for \\"work trips\\" every other week.  One night I discover pictures from a photo booth at a wedding of the two of them making out.  I confronted her, spent a month trying to work it out as I told her I was willing to chaulk it up to her Parkinson's, but she couldn't have a BF while we're doing it.  Ultimately, I had a medical emergency, tried to unalive myself, and while I was in the hospital THAT NIGHT my wife took out an OP against me, lying to get one granted.  Since then, I have not talked to my kid for over 6 months, I was made homeless because I can't go home, my wife took control of ALL of our assets and money while I was in the hospital for a week, and I'm still struggling to find a job while I got put up in a friend's 1 bedroom apartment.  Her BF has sent multiple threats to me that I took out an OP against him to protect myself and my daughter and he's violated that OP and plead guity to it, but I still can't see my kid.     When looking for pro bono lawyers, I was literally told by 2 that they \\"only help women.\\"  When I took out the OP against my wife's BF, I was treated VERY differently than the women who were present to do the exact same thing I was doing.     While I completely understand that I don't own my wife, and if she wants to get a divorce and go blow a football team every Tuesday, there's nothing I can do about it.  However, because my state, Illinois, is a \\"no fault\\" state, nothing that she has done is relevant.  She has been draining hundreds of thousands of dollars out of retirement accounts and other things we have.  While I don't think that there should just be \\"F you, you can't get divorced\\" laws, the \\"No Fault\\" laws I think, blow this WAY too far in the other direction.  There has to be some sort of middle ground, and some way to help people, regardless of gender, in these situations.    Nobody is there to help you.  If you can't afford a lawyer, you're fucked.  I appealed the OP (which is in process) but the thing works so slow that it will be Jan before I get a hearing to see if it gets kicked.  There's also nobody to help direct someone representing themselves.  For instance, when submitting paperwork, you have to add three \\"0's\\" in the MIDDLE of the case number.

Is he going to end it by dropping to his knees to slobber all over Putin's knob as he hands Russia the entire country? Is that the way that the war is ended? Is Trump going to personally fly to Ukraine, point his death ray at every Ukranian citizen, and then roll out the red carpet for Putin to walk across the charred landscape? You are putting your faith and a vote in the hands of a man that couldn't go a single day without lying well over a dozen times, stole classified intelligence from the federal government, shared it like it was a fucking poem book with anybody in his sphere, and is suffering from his decades long abuse of amphetamines.
