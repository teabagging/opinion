Like with a child who keeps breaking a rule over and over- they eventually need to be punished so that they learn what is ultimately best for them. It would be loving for a parent to punish. And as a side note, God never commanded anyone to rape anyone.Some other examples you listed were a result of the wickedness of a group of people. You can obviously disagree with God on what constitutes wickedness. But he is the Creator of the universe and is therefore qualified to decide good and evil. Just like laws in our society- we may not like them all, but we can agree that they serve a purpose and keep some level of order. The God of the Bible is totally just. If you had a judge in a court that just let everyone go free instead of throwing them in prison (hell), would he be a good judge? Would the victims of those criminals ever receive justice?And then there are some people that God tested. Yes, it was pretty brutal. But ultimately they passed the test and were richly rewarded. Our modern society may squirm at this idea (and many other biblical ideas), but again, who are we to judge? Just like parents see the big picture that their kids cant see and ultimately love their children and want good things for them, God acts in ways we struggle to understand.ETA: the Bible describes the devil as an angel of light who is craftily deceptive.

Although there have not been many treason prosecutions in American historyindeed, only one person has been indicted for treason since 1954the Supreme Court has had occasion to further define what each type of treason entails.The offense of **levying war** against the United States was interpreted narrowly in Ex parte Bollman &amp; Swarthout (1807), a case stemming from the infamous alleged plot led by former Vice President Aaron Burr to overthrow the American government in New Orleans.The Supreme Court dismissed charges of treason that had been brought against two of Burrs associatesBollman and Swarthouton the grounds that their alleged conduct did not constitute levying war against the United States within the meaning of the Treason Clause. It was not enough, Chief Justice John Marshall opinion emphasized, merely to conspire to subvert by force the government of our country by recruiting troops, procuring maps, and drawing up plans.Conspiring **to levy war was distinct from** actually **levying war.**?Rather, a person could be convicted of treason for levying war only if there was an **actual assemblage of men for the purpose of executing a treasonable design.** In so holding, the Court sharply confined the scope of the offense of treason by levying war against the United States.By actually [amassing/inciting](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/proud-boys-leader-sentenced-22-years-prison-seditious-conspiracy-and-other-charges-related) a group of supporters [to attack](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/jan-6-hearing-roger-stone-voting-violence-1234610680/) the Nations Capital (*actual assemblage of men*), to prevent the certification of the election he [knowingly lost](https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/2024-election/trump-saying-he-lost-could-mean-legal-trouble/) (*for the purpose of executing*), combined with the multi-State [fake elector](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/the-cases-against-fake-electors-and-where-they-stand/) scheme that is now [in evidence](https://imghoster.co/en/nPG4vUcEkUP83KY?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=unitedagainsttheright) (*a treasonable design*), Trump, his Admin, several [Secret Service](https://www.newsweek.com/pence-refusing-get-secret-service-car-jan-6-chilling-raskin-1700341) members, and many high ranking officials in various positions of powerincluding: \\n- SC?Justice, [Samuel Alito](https://apnews.com/article/alito-supreme-court-flags-history-symbol-protest-a5415aeba90e21a86a50f8489fc54b7a)\\n- Speaker of the House,?[Mike Johnson](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/mike-johnson-christian-nationalist-appeal-to-heaven-flag-1234873851/)\\n- SC Justice, [Clarence Thomas](https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/4501934-clarence-thomass-conflict-is-clear-he-must-recuse-himself-from-the-trump-immunity-case/)\\n- his spouse, [Virginia Ginni Thomas](https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/ginni-thomas-tells-jan-6-committee-she-regrets-texting-with-meadows-about-2020-election/)\\n- and [many more..](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/gop-lawmakers-were-intimately-involved-in-jan-6-protest-planning-new-report-shows)levied war against the US on J6, committing treason as written in the Constitution and further defined by founding father and Chief Justice, John Marshall.. and conservatives are going to [deny it happened](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/01/jd-vance-trump-2020-election-loss-debate/), while helping them [try again..](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/12/trump-overturn-result-presidential-election-vote)*[Penalty:](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason_laws_in_the_United_States#:~:text=Penalty%3A%20Under%20U.S.%20Code%20Title,office%20in%20the%20United%20States.)?Under U.S. Code Title 18, the penalty is death, or not less than five years imprisonment (with a minimum fine of $10,000, if not sentenced to death).**Any person convicted of treason against the United States also forfeits the right to hold public office in the United States.*And now it seems Elon*who has numerous defense contracts*is giving [*aid and comfort*](https://www.politico.eu/article/elon-musk-in-secret-contact-vladimir-putin-since-2022-claims-wall-street-journal-report-us-ukraine-russia-war-starlink/) to Putin.Finally.. read this [letter sent to Harris](https://freespeechforpeople.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/letter-to-vp-harris-111324-1.pdf) from election security officials begging her to ask for a by-hand recount, siting numerous data breaches linked to Trumps team.","title":"GOP Senator: Its a Slur to Call Tulsi Gabbard a Foreign Asset"},{"text":"I started watching The Boys this year.

And someone claiming that climate change is a hoax doesn't make that any less true.It also means bad ideas don't beat out good ones. Climate change denial is widespread among non-scientists, downplaying how quickly we need to transfer to renewable energy. People are claiming the democrats control the weather instead of seeing that climate change is making natural disasters more severe. Maybe in the long run many good ideas come out on top, but there will always be people on the other side of the issue causing harm.That is either true, and will eventually win, or false and will eventually die out and become as marginal as anti-vax are now. In both cases having the idea up for scrutiny is far *far* superior than censoring it because \\"X says so\\".Are you saying that truth is determined by what ideas eventually wins out? Who's to say we won't go extinct before we reach some absolute moral equilibrium? Why arbitrarily pick the far future to decide what's right and wrong? We seem to be going in a positive direction in terms of equality and civil rights but how do we know we won't go in the opposite direction in the future? Seems weird to base truth on the consensusThat's what has historically happened with a lot of things you take now as a given. Others in this thread have mentioned slavery, woman's suffrage and homosexual people amongs others. All of those ideas were \\"harmful\\" at some point in the past.Yeah I agree, just arguing that I don't think consensus defines good or that good always wins out. I mean covid denial has tangible physical harm while things like gay and interracial marriage simply offended people's sensibilities and challenged societal norms, so there is a distinction but I agree the precedent should not be set that the government can hold that power.

Using his forearm, he pushed Lutnick out of the way, according to two people familiar with the incident, which Lutnick later recounted to others. Im coming in, Epshteyn retorted, according to one of the people.A third person described the incident more as Epshteyn simply brushing past Lutnick on his way into the meeting, and someone close to both men said the two have been working closely together in assisting President Trump in putting together the greatest administration in American history. Epshteyn and Lutnick both declined to comment.It really leaves me scratching my head as to how Howard Lutnick went from being beloved company CEO to Trump flunky in less than two decades.For those of you who don't know him, he was the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald. Cantor lost around 2/3 of its employees in the 9/11 attacks, and Lutnick donated a considerable portion of his wealth towards relief for the victims of that attack plus other natural disasters. He earned a good bit of a Goodwill from the public in the process.20 years later he was bankrolling Trump's campaigns, loudly braying about how tariffs are going to make America great again, and shilling for cryptocurrencies.My how far the mighty have fallen.","title":"'Huge fight': Warring factions inside Trump transition get into 'big blowup' at Mar-a-Lago"},{"text":"Buckingham palace is where the royal family lives.

Every one of them is fine with ICE coming in and doing it's federal thing.  Not one uses \\"their police officers and resources to harbor and protect illegal criminal \\\\[sic\\\\] aliens...\\"She would also find that the fed lost in court the last time the federal government attempted to order state and local governments around. These \\"unfunded mandates\\" from the fed are unconstitutional. Elected and accountable state and local representatives levied the taxes that fund their programs.  They sued the federal government and won. Essentially, any attempt by the feds to assume control over these funds and resources is theft.     \\n  \\nIn particular, Bush attempted to to deputize state and local law enforcement to arrest and hold undocumented non-citizens purely because they were undocumented and non-citizens.  The state and local governments sued, arguing that this assumption of command was an \\"illegal taking.\\"    \\n  \\nThey pointed out that their police and jail resources are right-sized to handle state and local criminal needs.  They argued that,  if the Federal government wants to have this work done they should use their own money, send their own staff,  and create their own detention facilities.  In other words - \\"Feds, you do you.  Leave us alone; we've got more than we can handle already.\\"THAT is the sanctuary city position.  What Greene argues - using the threat of withholding unrelated other federal funding to extort this illegal taking - is a presumably a loser in court too.    \\n  \\nGreene - a cross-fitter cosplaying a congressional position - should know this.

Instead of policy being aimed directly at a rising foreign adversary threatening U.S. hegemony, it is being transformed into a loaded weapon locked onto Americas domestic war. It is aimed specifically at Trump C to hog tie him in, and to divert his attention to wars that he does not want.Logic suggests that Trump would want to keep clear of Netanyahus scheming for a war against Iran. But the Israel Firsters and the Lobby (as Professor Jeffrey Sachs argues) long have had effective control over Congress and the U.S. military C more than does the President. Explains Sachs:*Because the Zionist Lobby is so powerful, Netanyahu basically has had control over the Pentagon to fight wars on behalf of Israeli extremism. The war in Iraq in 2003 was a Netanyahu War. The attempt to overthrow Bashar al-Assad in Syria, the overthrow of Moamar Gaddafi C All were Netanyahu Wars.*\\nThe important point is that Netanyahu can do what he does because it was always planned this way C a plan that has been 50 years in execution. The Israel First strategy was fully embraced by Scoop Jackson (a two-times Presidential candidate). And just so the policy could not be rolled back, Scoop insisted on Zionists staffing the State Department, and that neo-cons and Zionists hold the reins at the NSC. That same pattern continues until today.At bottom lies the ultimate boondoggle by which the political class of both U.S. parties become wealthy and afford the campaign costs of remaining legislators: Its quite a dandy deal that the Israel Lobby or the Zionist Lobby puts in, say, a hundred million dollars into campaigns and it gets trillions out Ctrillions, not billions, trillions out [in government] expenditures. And so, when Netanyahu speaks, its bizarre to me, but it is not Trump who is appointing or naming [those Israel Firsters who are part of his Team, but Netanyahu], Sachs says.When Netanyahu describes Trumps Israel First nominations as his dream U.S. team, the explanation is not difficult to see. On the one hand, Trump has a Revolution to conduct in America and wants his nominations to office approved. And, on the other, Netanyahu has a further war he wants the U.S. to fight for him.","title":"The counter-insurgency is on C against Trumps storm"},{"text":"When laws, norms and customs are gone, the social contract is broken.

Trumps first presidency, lawyers at the attorney generals office in Washington State would gather to strategize about what they saw as troubling directives being handed down by the White House. There were orders barring travelers from Muslim-majority countries, rolling back environmental rules and ending protections for young immigrants. Lawyers in Washington and other states controlled by Democrats believed the actions were endangering rights and lives. But there was one thing working to their advantage: Many of the administrations orders were written in such a sloppy fashion, said Bob Ferguson, Washington States attorney general, that he repeatedly asked his staff members the same question: Do you guys think a lawyer looked at this? Often, it seemed as if nobody had, which gave the state ample opportunities to pursue what became a stream of successful legal challenges. Now, as Mr. Trump prepares for a second term, Mr. Ferguson said he anticipated that the initiatives from the incoming White House might not carry the same flaws. Mr. Ferguson, a Democrat who was recently elected to be Washingtons next governor, said Mr. Trump has built a cadre of advisers who have spent years planning ways to implement their plans for the country. The new administration also stands to benefit from a court system now tilted more in Mr. Trumps favor.","title":"Blue States Worry That Blocking Trump Will Be Tougher This Time"},{"text":"My dude.

The Animal advocacy entities have effectively blocked the efficient butchering of horse (North Carolina around 2010-2012 - can't remember for sure and traveling right now).\\n3.  Over 100K horses are transported to Mexico and Canada each year to lesser controlled and lesser controlled slaughterhouses (that is a low number and doesn't include the BLM Mustangs shipped because those numbers are not disclosed and usually go directly through a contracted broker so the final destination is hidden).\\n4.  Horses are overpopulated in the US, and almost all rescues are completely full.\\n6.  The prohibition on selling horse meat for human consumption happened in the middle of WW1 due to the shortage of horses for the war effort.\\n5.  They are not better, more emotional, or more trainable than almost any other herbivore (have cattle and bison that are ridden all the time and meet us at the gates, tractors, and UTVs).\\nLastly, I am all for the eating of horse.

Psychological harm, while real, is subjective and context-dependent, unlike the clear, objective harm of physical violence. Laws against speech are much harder to define and enforce consistently without giving disproportionate power to those in charge of interpreting harm. Thats why the legal threshold for restricting speech, like incitement or defamation, requires a direct and tangible connection to harmnot just emotional distress.As for your market analogy, it doesnt hold up. Markets are regulated to prevent actions like fraud or monopoliesclear, measurable harms that undermine the system itself. In contrast, regulating speech based on subjective offense or psychological harm would undermine the very mechanism of open discourse that allows us to challenge harmful ideas and improve society. Free speech isnt about endorsing harmful rhetoricits about ensuring the power to define harm isnt weaponized to silence dissent or unpopular opinions.

Or they did and they decided that a war to weaken Russia was more important than the lives and livelihoods of everyday Ukrainians. Don't mistake me for some Putin fan. My point here is that despite a reluctance to actually get our hands dirty in the conflict, the US played a significant roll in instigating it. All war is horrific and should be prevented at all costs. We took a risk with Ukrainian lives and our gamble did not pay off. The reason Ukraine wasn't in NATO earlier was because they were not eligible for membership and by many criteria still aren't. Even talking about adding them was specifically to piss off Russia which is a bad idea for obvious reasons.As to their other point, actually yes. Japan was our main source of cheap manufactured goods for decades before China started to really hit its stride industrially. It was a calculated investment in the same way that China was later on. As times change who has cheap labor changes and we tend to move production there. Industrialization is always built on cheap labor initially no matter where it is. The US did a lot to suppress workers movements and unionization during our industrial revolution. Big business runs the government in capitalist countries and they want low workers protections, low wages and cheap basic goods so they can maximize profit.  Japan's economy stalling in the 90's is a very interesting bit of history that is best left to others to explain as I am not as knowledgeable about that. Generally speaking I come from an anti-imperialist and anti-war perspective which stems from my understanding of how powerful nations in general have a tendency to instigate armed conflict for the personal benefit of their ruling class.  The US is no exception despite our posturing to the contrary. I would suggest you look into the history of US intervention in south and central American countries as well the history of colonialism in Africa. Learning about the actual history of those conflicts very much changed my worldview as imperialism is still very much alive, just under a different guise. I see the conflict in Ukraine primarily through the lens of great power proxy conflicts which is a long standing tradition in the area. In my view the facts speak for themselves and paint the American Government's intent as at the very least questionable.","title":"CMV: The U.S. will no longer be an independent nation by the end of this decade, and this is a sober view."},{"text":"He's not a sex trafficker.

Politicians like Trump can lie right now to get voter turnout, but if it means the voting power is diminished directly because Trump lied so much, then I would say this is overall good for the poorly educated groups. As you said, voters may feel that they are broke despite the economy doing well, but it would be great for them to actually know why we are where we are right now, instead of some grifter like Trump taking advantage of their lack of knowledge and anger to blame immigrants and offer quick solutions like tariffs that actually get voters to vote against their own interests. What you seem to be arguing right now is that because they are not as educated, them voting on misinformation is fine, when a knowledge test could make the whole process more honest overall. Times change. I wouldnt expect that something like this would ever get passed, because republicans would vote against it in droves. I never argued if it would ever get implemented, I argued that it *should* be implemented. The definition of what is and isnt constitutional also changes with time. In the beginning, it was deemed constitutional for only white men who owned property to be able to vote. If people said well it was deemed constitutional in 1776 so why are we talking about it, progress would never be made. Per the 14th amendment, I would argue that we could certainly preserve civil rights while acknowledging how pervasive lying has become in the political process, thus requiring a revisiting of knowledge checks. Again, why should we allow candidates to exploit their voting base, under the guise of it being constitutional, when we could analyze it closer to come up with a solution for candidates lying? Fines do nothing, as weve seen repeatedly with Trump. Its next to impossible to remove a candidate from the ballot, as weve again seen with Trump. Having their lies have actual consequences in the form of hurting their voting power would be devastating to a candidate like Trump. Also I know I keep saying Trump but its just because hes the poster child of this right now. Having it apply to all politicians would be the goal.","title":"CMV: Americans should have to take a basic knowledge test before being able to vote"},{"text":"\\\\ changeThat's the most overloaded word of this election.

The fact that everything is connected and works together is indicative of intelligent design. Just the way that everything interacts. The fact that this planet was set up for there to be medicine for us to find and utilize..1. Order and design point to an intelligent mind. You dont get order and design by chance. 2. The universe is eternal? No its not, there was a big bang so the universe had a beginning. Everything that had a beginning had a cause. The best explanation is an uncaused cause, thats God. 3. The Anthropic principle. Life is balanced on a razors edge. There are so many ingredients that go into this earth to sustain life that it was no accident. If the earth was a little closer to the sun then we would all fry. If it was further from the sun then we would all freeze. 4. The amount of information that is packed into the dna of a single cell points to an intelligent mind. Every time youre confronted with densely packed information there has to be an intelligent mind. 5. Charles Darwin pointed out that if something is irreducibly complex, the idea of evolution by chance and fate falls apart. Irreducibly complexity is where you go from this stage to this stage to this stage because without the previous stage, the next stage doesnt happen. You can not evolve a mouse trap from a slab of wood. Its irreducible complex, you need a slab a wood, a spring and a hammer. Its the same thing with your eye.. if something is missing from the eye, its not going to work. There are so many parts of the eye that are necessary for it to work that it cant exist without all of the stages to create it. A living cell is irreducibly complex. It cant go from one stage to another stage to another stage and all of a sudden become a living cell. 6. Moral absolute. The slaughter of innocent children is never good. It is always wrong. The only way that can be is if there is a God, a creator. If there is no God then its all relative. My atheist friends would look into the face of someone who abused a child and says you should not have abused that child. When they use the word should, they are appealing to a standard outside of  us and acting as if its real. The only way it can be real is if there is some God that defines it. 7. Love. Our experience of love tells us that there is more to reality than simple matter and energy. There is this innate ability of humans to care. 8. Rational mind. Your rational mind points to a rational god. Why? Its preposterous to believe that the rational comes from the non rational. Its ludicrous to believe the rational comes from the irrational. Thats why Darwin wrote a letter in 1883 to a man named Mr. Grant that says; if its true that our minds are simply highly developed monkeys minds. Why do we trust that to tell us the truth about reality? Why do trust the thoughts of a monkey? You cant know anything because your mind is an accident and comes from the irrational. No.. your mind is not an accident. Its so complex that its amazing. Its far more reasonable to believe your mind comes from a rational being than it does from the irrational. \\n9. You as a human being have an innate drive for meaning. Youre always attaching meaning to your life so are we all. The only way for there to be meaning is if there is a God who created you for a purpose. No God and there is no meaning. 10. The historical resurrection of Jesus Christ. The historical evidence is that he really died, he was really buried in the tomb of Joseph of Armathea. His followers dispersed in despair. Three days later he appeared risen from the dead over a period of 40 days to over 500 people who saw him at different times in different places risen from the dead. 11. I have never seen life come from non life. An atheist believes life comes from non life. If you talk about a blind leap of faith.. that would be the biggest one I can imagine. Why? Because from my observation plant life comes from plant life, animal life comes from animal life , human life comes from human life. Never once do you get the animate from the inanimate.","title":"It amazes me that people still believe in ancient religion, especially Abrahamic ones."},{"text":"They're being bombed and raped by Russians thats why they dont want to become part of Russias slaves.

Tariffs are a cost of goods added to the cost of an item. So if an item is $300 and a tariff is $200 then instead of being marked up to $600 at retail they are now marked up to $1000 assuming a 50% markup. The idea is designed to reduce demand for foreign goods. The problem is there is often not an American made product available to replace it. So now you buy an item that cost $400 more in this case or you don't buy it at all which is the desired effect. If you do buy it $200 goes to the government basically as a consumer tax and $200 goes to the billionaires whose lackey you just voted into office. If you buy the item you reduce your disposable income to eat out, buy groceries or do some other things you want to do. In addition the other country will retaliate and raise tariffs on something else you cannot get anywhere else than from them. While Trump thinks it is a good idea for him and his billionaire friends you as a consumer will get screwed and you still may not get an American job to make that item in the U.S. because billionaires will always look to produce goods at the lowest cost producer and it isn't here. In addition you would have been better off voting the Democrat into office because at the least you would have healthcare and the Democrats would insure high income earners would at least pay as much in taxes as your poor struggling rears and reduce the deficit which increases inflation due to the devaluation of the dollar abroad. Wake up America. You screwed up voting this crybaby bitch into office. Just remember to ask the same question you asked this year at the next election.

But, by the time the primary got to PA and it was down to Trump and Haley, I of course went with Trump. And then got more excited to see him win, given how bad both Democrat candidates were, and how he ran such a fun campaign. The tone was mostly different than the bitter tone he adopted after losing in 2020.In retrospect, his election denial COULD have been a plot to help him win the primary in 2024. Candidates who lose a presidential election rarely get a second chance to be the nominee. But him convincing a bunch of voters that he didn't lose, and that their votes were stolen, shored up his support.

Just like a person's race isn't always relevant as a descriptor neither is my trans-ness. Black men are not solely called black men. They're simply called men when race is not relevant to the topic at hand.So If we're talking about trans healthcare. Being specific and saying Trans woman would be relevant. It would help with clarity if the conversation.This is why the phrase: \\"Trans Women are Women, Trans Men are Men\\" gets shared around.","title":"Mike Johnson refuses to say that Sarah McBride is a woman"},{"text":"I already said it and got downvoted, but I'll say it again.

Heck, many of these conservatives...I'm not sure what age, state out loud that they want to kill AMERICAN liberals. You can imagine it's hard for those of us who have been politically consistent our entire lives (I'm a liberal, of course, from philly and new england)...to make sense of these changes....in any way except to see DANGER AHEAD.IMHO, any opposition based on money is ridiculous. This can only be due to folks being poor at math - that is, the amounts of money being dealt with are less than rounding errors in our multi-trillion dollar budgets. Even Ukraine - the total amount we have given and promised is maybe two weeks of US Health Care costs. For Isreal it's probably 1 days health care cost (health care in US is 11 billion per day).. It's good to question things. Another problem is that our system and life itself can't turn on a dime. Conservatives can't, without hypocrisy, spend decades supporting unlimited money on \\"security\\" , Wars and the Patriot Act and Tax cuts from Debt and Deficit and then....suddenly, speak out against the very things they wrote into laws (often with long term spending attached).I'd wager that many modern Conservatives don't blame conservatives for the results of things like the Patriot Act and so-on.

Also Theres no way either political party would survive running on a platform for getting rid of the 14th amendment that offers guaranteed civil liberties and rights to over 40% of the population of the country. theres no way the supreme courts would allow it and it would be ruled as unconstitutional due to previous rulings on voter tests by the supreme courts.

The push against free democratic western countries has always been here, and its coming to a head in that part of the world. If you care at all about preventing Russia from hurting other sovereign countries and the domino effect of letting it slide then you might understand.

Originally, it was theorized that earth was a perfect sphere, only to be later shown to be an oblate spheroid (flat at the poles), and then again centuries later determined that the earth is geoid (changes based on gravitation forces and plate tectonics.)Another example would be the atom, first believed to be an indivisible particle, only to later when we discovered the electron did the atom become divisible, then we discovered the nucleus of the atom is dense and positively charged, and electrons were in a fixed orbit, which gave us the planetary-like formation we studied in school, only to learn later that electronics aren't in a fixed orbit, and instead have probabilistic orbits, to today where now we know atoms have subatomic particles like quarks and gluons. I could go through a dozen examples of where facts as known were changed because we didn't accept things as fact, and kept trying to learn.This is why your argument is challenging. A lot of facts are subjective. Remember, during Covid we had facts coming out that showed covid-19 was possible to be spread through surface contact and people were told to freeze food, or clean with disinfectant only to learn later that the likelihood of surface transmission was so small that and limited to certain surfaces.At one point it was a fact that there were 9 planets in our solar system, now there are eight with five dwarf planets with the potential for more to be added.Facts change, and using the force of government to remove dissenting opinions on those facts is removing any ability to challenge them. You used the term outright lies, but the problem with that statement is who is determining what outright lies are. We have governments that lie to us all the time. America is taught that they are the best nation in the world. We know that isn't true. Chinese citizens are told that china is the best nation in the world, is that true? Russian citizens are told that Russia is the best country in the world, is that true?Show me an altruistic body that can determine what is true and what are outright lies.","title":"CMV: Free speech absolutism is rubbish"},{"text":"Its really crazy how they spun that.

The new Westbridge terminal will flow something like 800,000 barrels per day, about double what Valdez Alaska currently produces.From an American perspective it makes far more sense to send this oil to the gulf than the West coast which is done via existing pipelines or via barge down the Mississippi.Lastly, oil pipelines are tricky to run.

Absentee ballots are technically for people who can't get a voting place physically due to disability or something similar, but in practice it's the same mechanism and most people use them interchangeably. Let me give you a scenario. You're a political operative and you have access to a state government's datebase for it's people. Anyone working at a DMV or a similar government office would do. So you have access to everyone who is in the system. You have their names, addresses, social security numbers, and even their signatures on file. You also have their current voter registration. You mark down the information from the database for every person you find who is over the age of 40 and hasn't registered to vote and have never voted, and are thus unlikely to vote this time around either. There are tens of millions of these people. You then take that information and submit a fake voter registration with a change of address request, sending your new mail-in ballot to the address of your choice, where you can then fill it out. You and your co-conspirators do these for tens of thousands of individuals and ballots over the span of months in the lead up to an election. The election comes. You have unmonitored drop boxes that allow for people to drop off any number of ballots off through ballot harvesting, which is still legal in most places. These ballots then get processed on election day by a handful of election workers who are barely trained on signature matching, which is inexact unless you're an expert on the subject, who have to process hundreds of thousands of these ballots quickly. As long as the signature is vaguely close to what's on file, it gets approved and counted. Congratulations, you have just undetectably committed mass voter fraud. The only real way to 'catch' this kind of scheme is if the fraudsters fuck up and get overconfident in step 1 when filling out voter registrations and get sloppy with what they put down, which is what happened in PA this year. The only real 'sign' you could find with this otherwise would be statistical abnormalities....which 2020 was full of. As long as mail-in voting is allowed, a scheme like this is possible while also being incredibly difficult to prove that it's actually happening. Which is why most countries do not allow mail-in/absentee ballots to any significant degree.","title":"Biden Was the Fluke in 2020, Not Trump in 2016"},{"text":"Just a few years ago they were obsessed with trickle-down economics.

The Keystone XL pipeline would have ZERO impact on oil prices. You know what did? Trump, when oil prices inverted when Trump shut down the country, negotiated with Russia and Saudi Arabia to make huge oil production cuts. When the world started to reopen, these same countries did not increase production, oil skyrocketed, so did gas, which is why gas prices hit $5 a gallon nationally and that caused inflation to skyrocket.

I grew up in the South but left after high school to go out west. My dad got his undergrad followed by getting a master's in hospital administration in the 80s. He couldn't for the life of him get his foot into the door into hospital administration roles bc he simply was a black man with a masters during the 80s in the South. They would rather have a white person less educated being in those roles than a highly educated and ambitious black guy. My mom also has a master's in counseling in addition to her nursing degree. She had to move out west after I did in order for her to find roles and employers willing to offer her chances to prove herself. Many predominantly white-led companies in the southern states have talented and educated black employees. Very few are willing to promote them into management and leadership positions along with justly compensating them for those roles bc they simply don't want educated and talented black employees outshining everyone. Another area is education. Look at GATE (gifted and talented education) like programs and their makeup. Research into how black and Latino students, even high performing ones, aren't even offered the opportunity to test into those programs and you'll be either shocked or honestly not surprised.

Let me start by making something very clear: Trump is a fucking moron and a con artist. Elon is not. Vivek is not. We all want whats best for this country. No one can deny we have a serious debt problem. Kamala wasnt taking about it at all and wanted to make it worse. At least doge is willing to try and at least it has ppl talking about it. Doge doesnt have any taxing authority. It doesnt have any authority at all in fact. So the fear mongering really needs to stop. Doge is essentially an experiment to see if we can even begin to get the corruption and wasteful spending under control. My suspicion is that we cannot. In which case, we are doomed. actually doomed. It wont matter if a couple trans kids want to serve in the military bc there wont be a country to defend. We wont survive as a country more than 100 years and things will only get worse as inflation spirals out of control and the wealth gap widens (which is what will happen if we dont fix spending). We will implode. The average American cant even balance a checkbook so we cant possibly expect them to understand the gravity of this situation and the severity. The average American struggles not bc of billionaires, Elon, the elite, or tax cuts but because they are fiscally irresponsible and go\\nThrough life distracted focusing on shit that doesnt matter instead of themselves, their families, and their work. Congress will\\nNever fix it because we elect absolute morons  from Trump to AOC to Elizabeth Warren (who actually might be a full blown regard). So unless you have a better plan, I fully support this effort to at least bring the issue to light and its far more than Kamala or anyone else was willing to do.","title":"Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy: The DOGE Plan to Reform Government"},{"text":"If the governor went to all 100 counties and individually announced he was appointing new members to their boards of elections, he would just be ignored.

I knew logically that you were wrong based on my usage but I thought 'hey, yo know what, maybe this is one of those times where things are cross feeding and my political rants are getting picked up by some algorithm.So I went and grabbed my spouse's computer, booted up a quick VM went in through a fresh browser on a VPN and went to twitter.

Programs like Title I are permanently authorized, so eliminating it or even changing the funding formula would require new and improbable legislation. Its not something the Trump Administration can just implement, and theres insufficient support  for such measures in Congress. There are more moderate proposals out there, but lets take what Project 2025 calls for. Under their plan, neither Title I nor its funding would suddenly be *eliminated.*  *Transfer Title I, Part A, which provides federal funding for lower-income school districts, to the Department of Health and Human Services, specifically the Administration for Children and Families.*  Project 2025 (page 325)Project 2025 does propose legislatively changing the funding to formula block grants and to *Restore revenue responsibility for Title I funding to the states over a 10-year period.* (page 326) Neither of those proposals are dependent on the existence of the DoE though; they could legislate those while retaining the DoE. Most of the longer-term reductions or changes would require unlikely legislation. In general though, most of the core functions and programs do not simply go away, as is often asserted or implied. Theyre relocated to a variety of other agencies and bureaus.  *IDEA funding should be converted into a no-strings formula block grant targeted at students with disabilities and distributed directly to local education agencies by Health and Human Services Administration for Community Living.* *Transfer the Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Educations few programs to the Department of Labor.* *Move EDs statistical office, the National Commission for Education Statistics (NCES), to the Department of Commerces Census Bureau.*Again, I dont agree with the proposals.

The core of free speech protections is not to shield speakers from all consequences but to prevent the governmentor any central authorityfrom deciding which ideas can or cannot be expressed. Lets address your claims directly. First, you argue that Nick Fuentes speech was malicious and therefore shouldnt be protected because it caused fear in women. But this fundamentally misrepresents what free speech protections are designed to do. The law already provides avenues for addressing speech that directly incites violence, makes credible threats, or constitutes harassment. Fuentes rhetoric, vile as it may be, does not meet the legal standard of incitement as defined in Brandenburg v. Ohio: speech must be directed to inciting imminent lawless action and likely to produce such action. Offense, discomfort, or even fear induced by provocative rhetoric does not automatically qualify as unprotected speech. Allowing malicious intent to become the threshold for censorship creates a dangerously vague standard, ripe for abuse. What one group sees as malicious, another may view as a legitimate critique or controversial idea, and giving the government the power to decide arbitrarily would lead to endless weaponization of censorship.Second, your suggestion to create a clear standard of what is harmful at large ignores the fact that harm is inherently subjective and context-dependent. Speech that makes women fear for their safety is undoubtedly distressing, but the same subjective standard could be (and often is) used to argue that CRT harms white students or that LGBTQ+ representation harms traditional family values. You accuse free speech absolutism of being hypocritical, but its actually your argument that invites inconsistency. A harmful at large standard would not only result in selective enforcement but also empower those in powerwhoever they happen to be at the momentto suppress ideas they dislike under the guise of protecting others.Third, your example about sex-ed and book bans is actually an argument for free speech absolutism. Book bans and restrictions on medically accurate sex education are driven by subjective cultural preferences and moral panic, just like the calls to silence Fuentes. Free speech absolutism protects the right to challenge those bans just as it protects offensive speech. You cant selectively apply free speech principles only when it aligns with your values. Its not hypocrisy to defend speech you dislike; its the very purpose of free speechto prevent the suppression of ideas based on who holds the power to suppress them.Finally, the idea that free speech absolutism is weaponized by one group or another misses the point. Free speech protections exist not to favor any ideology but to ensure that all ideologiesno matter how offensive or unpopularcan be debated openly. The moment you start carving out exceptions based on maliciousness or subjective harm, you open the door for your own views to be censored when power shifts. Thats not a slippery slopeits historical precedent.The principle of free speech absolutism is simple: harmful rhetoric must be countered with more speech, not censorship. Your argument misunderstands this by conflating subjective offense or fear with objective harm and calling for vague, inconsistent standards that would inevitably be abused to suppress dissenting voicesyours included. Free speech absolutism is not hypocritical; its the safeguard against the very double standards you claim to oppose.","title":"CMV: Free speech absolutism is rubbish"},{"text":"No they wont.","title":"Republican senator: Well have lots of questions for Trumps controversial picks"},{"text":"Well, with Epstein gone, Trump's gotta have someone he can relate to close by.","title":"Trumps White House is filling with alleged sexual abusers ... led by him"},{"text":"You dont.

Trump's team targeted them with deceitful ads (both praising Kamala for being a friend to Israel and presenting Trump as the peace president) and actively woo'd leaders in those communities. So then a week before the election, Bill Clinton goes Michigan to give a lecture on the war.  Again, the Michigan was probably lost at this point, but Clinton was like rubbing their faces in it.  Just a wildly stupid and unhelpful thing to do.And as far as Epstein goes, who knows what benefit being able to hit Trump on his connection to Epstein would have brought?
