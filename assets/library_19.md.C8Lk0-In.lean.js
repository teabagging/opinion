Your argument misunderstands this principle and risks creating precisely the kind of arbitrary enforcement you claim to oppose.Let's start with this, because I think you are completely misunderstand the issue here. I am not arguing against Fuentes being a misogynistic douchebag who thinks that women should obey men from making arguments and statements that lead towards that. I am arguing against him being legally protected from consequences after creating a situation where women are now objectively afraid for their safety, then when confronted on it, doubled-down instead of doing damage control or saying something that is meant to attenuate the worst case scenarios of that.He was informed of the harm of what he said, and he repeated it and went further.This shows intent, this shows that he either didn't care, or intended those consequences, and that he has zero intention to reduce the psychological and sociological harm he caused to women. His speech had no other purpose than \\"I want you to be scared of men, and I want you to know it's your expected place\\". This is malicious speech.And my point is that speech performed with malice shouldn't be protected.Now, to address this, since it addresses the rest of the response and my comment:Your critique of sex education and book bans actually illustrates why free speech protections are critical. The same principle that allows CRT to be taught or books about gay penguins to exist is what prevents others from silencing opposing views. The fight isnt against free speech absolutismits against inconsistent applications of censorship driven by cultural preferences. By trying to broaden restrictions on speech, youre not solving the problem of inconsistent enforcement; youre exacerbating it.This here is where your argument misunderstands mine.You seem to have taken that to mean \\"hey, if that can be banned, then why isn't this banned?\\". My point was actually \\"hey, if harmful speech is allowed when it makes women fear for their safety, why isn't \\"harmful\\" speech allowed too when it makes teens and LGBTQ+ people feel more included, and doesn't really harm white people who aren't electing to take those classes?\\"It's not \\"let's ban everything\\", it's \\"let's have a clear standard on what is actually considered harmful at large, and stick to it except in very close edge cases\\". If sex-ed is considered harmful at large because it encourages teens and kids to have sex they shouldn't have (like the pearl-clutchers love to remind us), then Fuentes' \\"your body, my choice\\" and subsequent doubling-down is also harmful at large, and this time measurably.You can tell from Monday, Nov. 4, where boys and men in school weren't actually saying that, to Wednesday, Nov. 6, where they were. You can tell by how directly it affected women, who now were actually fearing for their safety, and were stressed enough to want to not go to class until the core of those chants was stopped in some way.If \\"harmful at large\\" speech is allowed, then all of it should be. If it's not, then none of it should be. Pick one, stick to it, because the way it stands, free speech absolutism is at best hypocritical, and realistically, being weaponized by the pearl-clutchers and Christian Nationalists who use a book that they clearly haven't read to oppress people the book doesn't directly attack on condemn in the half they should care about.","title":"CMV: Free speech absolutism is rubbish"},{"text":"\\"Kamala is supported by the billionaires!!

Democracies have safeguards like constitutions, independent judiciaries, and minority protections specifically designed to prevent majoritarian oppression. It also ignores the role of institutions and compromise in mitigating excesses, assumes all majority decisions are tyrannical, and fails to acknowledge that alternative systems often result in minority tyranny (e.g., dictatorships).

If you can find me, in any Critical Race Theory class (the college ones, not the falsely reported high school classes) any individual person of today's world thag is directly harmed by that speech, then I will retract this.Here in an interview from 2009 (published in written form in 2011) Richard Delgado describes Critical Race Theory's \\"colonization\\" of Education:DELGADO: We didn't set out to colonize, but found a natural affinity in education. In education, race neutrality and color-blindness are the reigning orthodoxy. Teachers believe that they treat their students equally. Of course, the outcome figures show that they do not. If you analyze the content, the ideology, the curriculum, the textbooks, the teaching methods, they are the same. But they operate against the radically different cultural backgrounds of young students. Seeing critical race theory take off in education has been a source of great satisfaction for the two of us. Critical race theory is in some ways livelier in education right now than it is in law, where it is a mature movement that has settled down by comparison.https://digitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;context=facultyI'll also just briefly mention that Gloria Ladson-Billings introduced CRT to education in the mid-1990s (Ladson-Billings 1998 p. 7) and has her work frequently assigned in mandatory classes for educational licensing as well as frequently being invited to lecture, instruct, and workshop from a position of prestige and authority with K-12 educators in many US states.Ladson-Billings, Gloria. \\"Just what is critical race theory and what's it doing in a nice field like education?.\\" International journal of qualitative studies in education 11.1 (1998): 7-24.Critical Race Theory is controversial. While it isn't as bad as calling for segregation, Critical Race Theory calls for explicit discrimination on the basis of race. They call it being \\"color conscious:\\"Critical race theorists (or crits, as they are sometimes called) hold that color blindness will allow us to redress only extremely egregious racial harms, ones that everyone would notice and condemn. But if racism is embedded in our thought processes and social structures as deeply as many crits believe, then the ordinary business of societythe routines, practices, and institutions that we rely on to effect the worlds workwill keep minorities in subordinate positions. Only aggressive, color-conscious efforts to change the way things are will do much to ameliorate misery.Delgado and Stefancic 2001 page 22This is their definition of color blindness:Color blindness: Belief that one should treat all persons equally, without regard to their race.Delgado and Stefancic 2001 page 144Delgado, Richard and Jean Stefancic Critical Race Theory: An Introduction. New York. New York University Press, 2001.Here is a recording of a Loudoun County school teacher berating a student for not acknowledging the race of two individuals in a photograph:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bHrrZdFRPkStudent: Are you trying to get me to say that there are two different races in this picture?Teacher (overtalking): Yes I am asking you to say that.Student: Well at the end of the day wouldn't that just be feeding into the problem of looking at race instead of just acknowledging them as two normal people?Teacher: No it's not because you can't not look at you can't, you can't look at the people and not acknowledge that there are racial differences right?Here a (current) school administrator for Needham Schools in Massachusetts writes an editorial entitled simply \\"No, I Am Not Color Blind,\\"Being color blind whitewashes the circumstances of students of color and prevents me from being inquisitive about their lives, culture and story. Color blindness makes white people assume students of color share similar experiences and opportunities in a predominantly white school district and community.Color blindness is a tool of privilege. It reassures white people that all have access and are treated equally and fairly. Deep inside I know thats not the case.https://my.aasa.org/AASA/Resources/SAMag/2020/Aug20/colGutekanst.aspxThe following public K-12 school districts list being \\"Not Color Blind but Color Brave\\" implying their incorporation of the belief that \\"we need to openly acknowledge that the color of someones skin shapes their experiences in the world, and that we can only overcome systemic biases and cultural injustices when we talk honestly about race.\\" as Berlin Borough Schools of New Jersey summarizes it.https://www.bcsberlin.org/domain/239https://web.archive.org/web/20240526213730/https://www.woodstown.org/Page/5962https://web.archive.org/web/20220303075312/http://www.schenectady.k12.ny.us/about_us/strategic_initiatives/anti-_racism_resourceshttp://thecommons.dpsk12.org/site/Default.aspx?PageID=2865Of course there is this one from Detroit:We were very intentional about creating a curriculum, infusing materials and embedding critical race theory within our curriculum, Vitti said at the meeting. Because students need to understand the truth of history, understand the history of this country, to better understand who they are and about the injustices that have occurred in this country.https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/detroit-superintendent-says-district-was-intentional-about-embedding-crt-into-schoolsAnd while it is less difficult to find schools violating the law by advocating racial discrimination, there is some evidence schools have been segregating students according to race, as is taught by Critical Race Theory's advocation of ethnonationalism. The NAACP does report that it has had to advise several districts to stop segregating students by race:While Young was uncertain how common or rare it is, she said the NAACP LDF has worked with schools that attempted to assign students to classes based on race to educate them about the laws. Some were majority Black schools clustering White students.https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/18/us/atlanta-school-black-students-separate/index.htmlThere is also this controversial new plan in Evanston IL which offers classes segregated by race:https://www.wfla.com/news/illinois-high-school-offers-classes-separated-by-race/Racial separatism is part of CRT. Here it is in a list of \\"themes\\" Delgado and Stefancic (1993) chose to define Critical Race Theory:To be included in the Bibliography, a work needed to address one or more themes we deemed to fall within Critical Race thought. These themes, along with the numbering scheme we have employed, follow:...8 Cultural nationalism/separatism. An emerging strain within CRT holds that people of color can best promote their interest through separation from the American mainstream. Some believe that preserving diversity and separateness will benefit all, not just groups of color. We include here, as well, articles encouraging black nationalism, power, or insurrection.

You argue that free speech protections allow for measurable harm to reputations at a large scale, but you ignore that legal remedies, such as defamation and libel laws, already exist to address those specific cases. These laws target speech that demonstrably and falsely damages an individual, which is entirely different from censoring ideas because they make people uncomfortable or challenge societal norms.Your examplesCritical Race Theory, book bans, and sex-ed restrictionsare straw men. Free speech absolutists do, in fact, consistently oppose laws that limit free expression in these cases. Many free speech advocates fight against book bans, support age-appropriate sex education, and oppose the demonization of academic frameworks like CRT. Youre arguing as if free speech absolutists are your opposition in these scenarios when, in fact, they are often your allies. The principles of free speech apply equally to those who want to challenge CRT as to those defending it. Thats the point: to ensure that all ideas, including those you dislike, are subject to open debate.As for your examples of harmNick Fuentes your body, my choice comment making women feel unsafe, or CRT making white people feel badthis again conflates emotional discomfort or offense with actionable harm. Fuentes rhetoric may be vile, but its not illegal to offend or provoke emotional reactions. The threshold for restricting speech isnt whether it makes someone feel unsafe but whether it directly incites violence or meets a specific legal standard, such as defamation or threats. You cannot legislate against offense without creating a tool that governments can weaponize against any dissenting speech, including speech you support. Protecting free speech isnt about endorsing harmful rhetoricits about preventing censorship from becoming a tool for suppressing ideas.Your critique of sex education and book bans actually illustrates why free speech protections are critical. The same principle that allows CRT to be taught or books about gay penguins to exist is what prevents others from silencing opposing views. The fight isnt against free speech absolutismits against inconsistent applications of censorship driven by cultural preferences. By trying to broaden restrictions on speech, youre not solving the problem of inconsistent enforcement; youre exacerbating it.In short, free speech is not about guaranteeing zero consequences for harmful rhetoricits about ensuring that no authority gets to dictate, arbitrarily and unilaterally, what ideas are allowed in the public square. Your argument misunderstands this principle and risks creating precisely the kind of arbitrary enforcement you claim to oppose.","title":"CMV: Free speech absolutism is rubbish"},{"text":"But why would that open up his seat?

I understand the justification would be that \\"the violence is the issue, not the speech\\". But people in power are still having to make the subjective judgment that that form of speech presents a credible threat that will extend \\"outside the realm of speech\\". Your whole argument earlier was that having people making these sorts of decisions about somebody's speech is incredibly dangerous. Tasking \\"the courts\\" with whether or not this is a credible or a direct threat seems to me to fall prey to the same arguments you were making just before - about how we shouldn't censor the free flow of ideas. Free speech absolutists don't usually suppose that the government is necessarily going to start censoring ideas on the basis that the ideas are \\"wrong\\"; the more commonly brought-up fear is that the government will justify outlawing these views on the basis that they are \\"dangerous\\". And then this will lead to a slippery slope. Plus, free speech absolutists typically are against hate speech laws - but hate speech can certainly lead to harm or violence.

If person A walks into a room and shoots person B dead, that is murder. No question, no ambiguity. It's very clear. If person A walks into a room and says something, you might think what they said is offensive, other might not. And nobody would be objectively correct or incorrect. Most liberals who would support \\"free speech absolutism\\" believe that laws should roughly be about ensuring an individual's right to live safely and ensure protection for themselves and their property. Crimes like murder, assault, rape, theft, etc, clearly go against that principle. Hearing something you deem to be offensive does not. So murder and offensive speech are simply completely different categories of acts.The rule of law is itself a kind of tyranny, right. The state is basically saying, you do thing thing we say is against the rules and we will come and get you and lock you away. Most people accept that to some degree because it does ensure a level of order and security enough to allow a functioning society. But it's a very reasonable position to say that the law should basically reach that point of ensuring order and security enough for society to function and go no further, at least when it comes to individual liberty.Being OK with people doing things you may bit like but that ultimately don't harm other people is a cornerstone of liberalism. That's the standard most people who support free speech are judging things by. Free speech passes that test. Murder does not.Also, in this case, hurt feelings don't count.","title":"CMV: Free speech absolutism is rubbish"},{"text":"With tariffs, then the domestic slave made stuff will be the only affordable products.","title":"Trump's vow to use US troops for mass deportations could face intense resistance  starting from within the military"},{"text":"[https://www.aei.org/op-eds/us-emissions-are-falling-under-trump-thanks-to-frackings-war-on-coal/](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/us-emissions-are-falling-under-trump-thanks-to-frackings-war-on-coal/)","title":"Donald Trump wants to revive long-dead Keystone XL pipeline as he pushes fossil-fuel agenda"},{"text":"I didnt vote for a sex offender.?","title":"Orders for Morning-After Pills and Abortion Pills Rise After Trumps Election"},{"text":"I bet he signs papers for about an hour then goes golfing.","title":"Trump's plan to dismantle DEI on day one is a \\"colorblind\\" path to Jim Crow 2.0"},{"text":"Fire them ?

The requirement you list there is making actually harming the population in some way a legally-protected speech.This means, for instance, that you should also be seeing free speech absolutists fight anti-speech laws that target \\"anti-white\\" speech, like how laws shouldn't ever be made to address things like critical race theories (which are things now), for committing the \\"heinous\\" crime of saying \\"white people aren't perfect\\", and making some white people feel a bit bad about what some of their ancestors may or may not have done in the past. If you can find me, in any Critical Race Theory class (the college ones, not the falsely reported high school classes) any individual person of today's world thag is directly harmed by that speech, then I will retract this.This is equally a problem about book bans, which are allowed to remove a book about gay penguins raising an egg for being \\"sexually charged\\", without anything remotely sexual happening in it. If you can find a copy of that penguins book, and point me the page where they teach kids in detail about how to have gay sex, and also any kid that was actively traumatized by it personally, then I will retract this.This is also a problem when some states and/or school districts are actively banning medically-accurate sex-ed classes that would help reduce teen pregnancies, the spread of STDs, and would actually give an adequate framework to identify and alert the authorities fo unwanted/undesired sexual behavior from friends and families, or towards friends or families. These medically-accurate sex-ed classes are usually made to be age-appropriate, thus are unlikely to cause any actual harm, except that puritan pearl-clutchers say it is, so they are banned in way too many locations in the US, under the pretense of showing 7 year olds how to have sex somehow. Like the other two examples, though, if you can provide specific examples of a medically-accurate sex ed class causing direct harm to an individual person (as in, they went in fine, and came out worse for wear), and it not be a result of the educator in charge of it refusing to address LGBTQ+ subjects as they are raised (as this is a completely differrnt matter than this being sex-ed), I will retract this too.Speech-restricting laws have been made without there being any actual direct harm to an individual person. This much undenyable. To pretend that all speech-restricting that is currently in place is only to prevent \\"individual persons\\" from being \\"directly harmed\\" is naive and ignorant of how reality is.Nick Fuentes caused a lot more harm with his \\"your body, my choice\\" comment than the gay penguin book telling a cute egg-raising story to kids, than acknowledging that by a very overwhelming majority, slave owners in the US were white and it contributed to a veritable cornucopia of black-targeted legislation, or than acknowledging that teens will have sex, so might as well show them how to use a condom the correct way, and identify sexual abuse.Yet one of those 4 things is allowed, and it's the one that is making women feel largely unsafe right now.","title":"CMV: Free speech absolutism is rubbish"},{"text":"They buy into the mens narrative that all of these sexual assault charges are bogus and its a conspiracy to bring down their candidate.

Nobody says, \\"well, I know you think murder is wrong - but I think wearing a hat is wrong. Think how terrible it would be if you made it illegal for me to murder people. If everybody thought that way about other people's right to Do As They Liked, eventually they might introduce a law against wearing hats! You like wearing hats. You wouldn't be able to Do As You Liked in that case! So let's agree you shouldn't restrict me and I won't restrict you\\".This is what comes from only looking at the form of the argument and not its underlying ideology.The argument against murder isn't that you have a right to commit murder that we are restricting, it's that everyone has a right to life and if you deprive someone of that right you have committed a violation of that right. Only if someone is actively seeking to cause harm to another person can depriving the offender of their life ever be justified. Similarly, the free speech issue argues that you have a right to free speech and that no one has the right to arbitrarily deprive you of it. Only when you misuse your speech to harm someone else can you be held liable.The shared element is when harm is done to someone else directly by your actions. Not whether you can prove someone objectively wrong in there actions.","title":"CMV: Free speech absolutism is rubbish"},{"text":"I mean even if he was on the extreme flank of the right he still falls in with someone like Secretary Buttigieg when it comes to qualifications.

It's a pretty common translation thing - if we were to translate it more literally and less directly it would be \\"murderous intent\\". But regardless, another language doesn't define ours. English does not define murder as definitionally evil, only definitionally illegal. You can also see this in real life - many people who murder their abusers aren't considered to have done anything wrong by many.Why isn't EVERY majority a tyranny, regardless of what unites them?Because a tyranny is a long term absolute control. If the majority consistently changes, depending on the time and the issue, there there is no long term, and there is no absolute control.I would argue these would be the only set of ideal and morally correct laws.Feel free to do so. That doesn't really challenge the OPs argument because they don't approach it from that stance. If you want to challenge their belief you have to do so from their point of view, not yours, or it doesn't make sense.I guess I'm saying it's different enough that we can't use violent crime as an analogy. You have to come up with a separate argumentIf the OP was arguing that because murder is illegal, some speech should be illegal because they're the same thing, I'd agree. His argument for that part AFAIK was simply that you can't justify hate speech because some people think it's morally OK, just like how you can't allow murder because some people (mostly murderers) think it is fine. And in that argument, it doesn't matter if they're categorically different crimes.","title":"CMV: Free speech absolutism is rubbish"},{"text":"And Trump won the tipping point state, Pennsylvania, by 122k?

One argument that occurs to me while writing this comment is that if you're right that taking that first step raises the *possibility,* at least, of tyranny taking hold, then it's a matter of quantifying that possibility and balancing it against the harm the proposed law to restrict free speech in this instance is *supposed* to prevent.

How is making laws based on the majority (whoever they are) different from tyranny of the majority?Because the majority can be different, whereas in tyranny of the majority it isn't. For example, in tyranny of the majority, you could have all white people in the US vote the same way. They would then always determine the federal law because they are the majority. That is tyranny of the majority.But if on one issue all the white people voted one way and on another issue half the white people voted one way and half the other, then it wouldn't be a tyranny of the majority even if white people are the majority. You're correct in saying nonviolent property theft is different from murder, but we still have 3 separate categoriesAgain, it doesn't matter that they are different. As shown, you can have things be categorically different and still be unacceptable.  I'd also argue being insulted doesn't violate anyone's rights.If laws were solely determined by violating rights, we would have different laws.If you want to disprove OPs argument you have to show that speech is different in a way that specifically means it should not be made illegal, as opposed to just showing its different or that it doesn't meet one of many standards used to decide if something should be illegal.","title":"CMV: Free speech absolutism is rubbish"},{"text":"Fantasizing is the wrong word, fearing would be more accurate.","title":"Calling it now: Trump Plaza Gaza"},{"text":"HOW are they still shocked by this stuff...","title":"You Dont Care?: GOP Senator Shocks ABC Host With Take on Background Checks for Trump Picks"},{"text":"Dont worry, the billions he steals from the US government will pay for it.","title":"Trumps White House is filling with alleged sexual abusers ... led by him"},{"text":"What are you trying to say in plain English and being straightforward??","title":"Orders for Morning-After Pills and Abortion Pills Rise After Trumps Election"},{"text":"is a 34x convicted criminal","title":"Trump accused of opening door to financial corruption as transition donors kept secret"},{"text":"I actually like her voice.

Free speech is not just another rightit is the right that protects all others. It is the mechanism through which we negotiate conflicts, challenge power, and reach the very consensus you claim justifies laws in the first place. Without free speech, there is no way to mediate disagreements or even determine what the consensus is, let alone test its validity. Suppressing speech undermines this process and destroys the foundation on which any legitimate societal consensus rests.Of course, laws are shaped by societal consensus, but the consensus behind protecting free speech acknowledges that the risks of suppressing it far outweigh the perceived benefits. Laws against murder prevent clear, direct harm to individuals and are universally accepted because they protect the right to life, the most fundamental of all rights. Free speech, on the other hand, operates in the realm of ideas, not actions, and its protection ensures that society can self-correct, evolve, and hold power accountable. Equating the two fails to grasp this essential distinction.Your assertion that societal consensus is enough to justify banning Holocaust denial is dangerously naive. Societies have often reached consensus on heinous practicesslavery, segregation, apartheiduntil brave individuals used their free speech to challenge those norms. Protecting free speech ensures that harmful ideas can be exposed, debated, and defeated, rather than festering unchallenged in the shadows. Censorship doesnt eliminate dangerous ideas; it gives them the allure of forbidden truth and drives them underground, where they thrive without scrutiny.The history of censorship demonstrates why we cannot trust any authoritywhether a majority or a governmentto decide what speech is too dangerous. Laws against murder are clear-cut because the harm is immediate and undeniable. Speech laws, by contrast, rely on subjective and shifting standards of offense or harm, making them ripe for abuse. Once you allow the suppression of speech on the grounds that it is too dangerous, you open the door for those in power to expand that definition to suit their own purposes. Today its Holocaust denial; tomorrow it could be dissent against the government, criticism of societal norms, or advocacy for marginalized groups.Free speech is not about endorsing hateful or false ideasits about ensuring the tools exist to challenge them. Protecting free speech means protecting the process by which society debates, negotiates, and ultimately reaches consensus on what laws should exist and what values we hold. It is the lifeblood of democracy and progress. Your argument not only fails to understand this but actively threatens the very principle that allows us to resolve conflicts and build a just society.","title":"CMV: Free speech absolutism is rubbish"},{"text":"Tbh Ive always wanted to leave the states since I was a kid, and Ive been working towards leaving for awhile.

I think that facts still matter, it's just people don't argue them effectively enough. It shouldn't be inspecific, but it shouldn't be so specific that Trump is being psychoanalysed for a turn of phrase. Instead it should be the broad specifics of actions. Also being polite while telling folks your opinion. If you can make people feel less righteously indignant, they'll settle some (not everyone, but I guarantee a lot more people would be attentive)Like let's look at calling Trump a fascist - easily digestible, self-righteous, creates a 'versus'. But that versus also condemns supporters of Trump and that's not helpful. Nobody can meet in the middle if you create that divide. But by focusing on broad specifics you don't create that divide because you wouldn't be saying 'Trump is a fascist' you would say 'Trump has done things that are very similar to these figures.' And not because Trump has said similar things. Again, action specific. Trump has done this thing, which this history book says has been done by \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_.Because so much of the argument is that he hasn't done anything remotely similar, and you'd be hard pressed to find a politician comparing Trump's economic policy to fascists, or his actual campaign approach to fascists in more broad contexts, history books showing us Trump's template in applicable contexts are invaluable yet underused. So you can draw direct examples, and say that he specifically is following the model of Soviet era policy regards to say self-sustaining economic model, or appointment of staff members, or throw in a quote about how Hitler campaigned and then add in the quote from Trump.  Then you break up the righteousness against communists or whoever, and gradually chip away at the logic.And people can do that without being accusatory or acting disdainfully of people's stupidity. Yes, lots of people will lack patience or empathy, but that doesn't mean everyone will and empathy is really essential. By opting for easy statements like 'Trump said this and it's similar to what someone else said and it makes you a bad person if you like him' it's just ineffective.A lot of it will be reliant on questions. What you want to do to guide people to a correct solution, or a more thoughtful one, is establish a possible outcome. I'm not saying there is a definitive correct, but just that people are morel likely to reach reasonable outcomes with further thinkingWhen people say Kamala Harris slept her way to the top, guide people into realising that the logic they're using against Kamala is the same logic people use when saying Donald Trump probably committed crimes against women, and state the reasons: friends with well known trafficker, made xyz comment, married to multiple people. Kamala Harris is told she's slept to the top cos she was going out with a guy. Then propose both of you could be wrong, rather than one of you is right. Create room for error so that people consider alternatives before automatically committing to a single unquestionable realm of truthAlso another tip: instead of directly emoting like 'I'm so upset', or accusing 'you did this and now this is gonna be a thing,' ground it by saying 'I'm afraid this will happen as a result of this' so people can directly address your concerns rather than defend against your statementsAnd make sure to make common sense statements.* I don't like the idea that Trump is backed by lots of big tech billionaires who say bad things about their employees, or do bad things to them. I feel like those guys don't want regulation on AI and other things that could disrupt day to day life and security, rather than fix it. Especially if they can buy their way into the white house - I don't want rich dudes deciding anything about me\\n* How is Trump going to train all the people to replace lost immigrant workers?

Living presuming everything is black and white is an absurd position to take- and means your ideas will never stand up in the marketplace of ideas.Most people agree that bad speech is bad- and if someone decides that punching that person and committing a crime is worth it- that is all part of the marketplace.However, if you're inciting people to go murder someone or commit a coup, you're directly infringing on other people rights to \\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\\". To put it into perspective, your ability to stop someone from speaking (regardless of content) starts and stops when your rights are being infringed. That same mentality applies to most self-defense laws.You cannot shoot someone running away even though you know they may steal from another person- namely because your life/property is no longer at risk.With that extrapolation, if people incite violence against another group or action, that's where the law steps in. There's a big difference between, \\"we hate the Jews\\" and \\"Let's go kill Jews.\\" They may be tangentially correlated, but not necessarily equal.","title":"CMV: Free speech absolutism is rubbish"},{"text":"I watch porn WHILE working! :P (Checking transcripts is boring AF, okay?)","title":"Republicans be like:"},{"text":"Aka picking winners and losers something the conservatives supposedly hate with a passion, unless youre picking them over their competitors.., then its totally cool beans and fuck all the free market BS /s","title":"Trump's tariffs will be paid by the exporter and not the consumer"},{"text":"Ukraine leadership is far from peaceful.

He tossed them the keys to his administration after he won. The CNP is full of Christian nationalists and where Trump picked up folks like Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon.[Council for National Policy Membership Directory 2014](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/cnp_redacted_final.pdf) (Redacted)It is best to think of Trump as a vote-getting machine and his backers as the ones crafting policy and staffing his administration with folks who will execute the plan. When Trump suddenly appeared on the scene, his eventual backers were caught unprepared in his first term, but the network has been hard at work since then to maximize the advancement of their agenda in a second Trump administration.If you climb up the food chain of deeply conservative Christian nationalist and libertarian organizations vying for control of the country, youll find the Council for National Policy, which serves as an umbrella organization for its member groups.Back in 2016, the Council for National Policy was behind Ted Cruz, but they were unable to stop Trump from winning the primary. Trump did not have an administrative team or any policies to speak of at the time because he ran on a narcissistic whim for self-promotion, not expecting to win.After winning the primary, he gained the support of the Council for National Policy by promising, for example, to give them their justice picks and use extremists from the CNP in key positions within his administration. The CNP never had so much wide-ranging, direct access before so they enthusiastically adopted Trump as their imperfect vessel and directed their member groups to fall in line and support him.New Republic - [A Rare Peek Inside the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy](https://newrepublic.com/article/167002/council-national-policy-documents-right-wing-conspiracy)The Heritage Foundation, a meeting sponsor, has been a core partner of the Council for National Policy from the start, and Heritage president Kevin Roberts is on the CNP board of governors.Together, the organizations would serve as a three-legged stool for the right, with Heritage [Foundation] as the think tank; [American Legislative Exchange Council] as a state-level bill mill; and the [Council for National Policy] as a coordinating body for donors, media, and activists.Washington Post - [God, Trump and the Closed-Door World of a Major Conservative Group](https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2021/10/25/god-trump-closed-door-world-council-national-policy/)In October 2015, Donald Trump was still a laugh line for right-wing Christian activists. By their lights he was a failed casino owner and thrice-married playboy. He had no apparent principles, no policy blueprint and no grasp of the Bible. He didnt even understand free-market theory, something they consider to be a fountainhead of American liberty. Yet here he was in a conference room at the Ritz-Carlton in McLean, Va., soliciting support from a closed-door group of conservative leaders called the Council for National Policy.For months after the event, Dannenfelser and some other CNP members were determined to stop Trump. While he solidified his lead as GOP front-runner, they denounced him as a charlatan in the conservative magazine National Review, blasted his prior support of abortion rights and implored Republican voters to choose another candidate.Then came a great swerve that would upend politics in America: Millions of conservatives  Dannenfelser and other CNP members among them  got firmly behind Trump.McGahn thought Trump could benefit by releasing a list of nominees to replace Scalia, an unusual move that would reassure religious and social conservatives who wanted an anti-abortion jurist. Trump expressed support for one of Leos long-cherished goals: a federal court system dominated by judges who would interpret the Constitution in ways that favored business and conservative views.In the summer of 2016, Trump made another strategic move that would seal the deal with Dannenfelser, the anti-abortion activist, and other CNP members. He pledged to oppose abortion and put the promises onto paper in September. Dear Pro-Life Leader, Trumps letter began. I am writing to invite you to join my campaigns Pro-Life Coalition, which is being spearheaded by longtime leader Marjorie Dannenfelser. Trump said he would nominate pro-life justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, defund Planned Parenthood and take other measures that the anti-abortion activists had demanded.Dannenfelser was thrilled. Before that we were still stomping our feet, she said last year at a CNP meeting, according to one of the internal videos. Little did we know that this man, who was a performer and can incite audiences in ways we never even thought could be, would galvanize audiences in battleground states all over the country and put life at the center of the project. The CNP crowd whooped and hollered at her remarks.In Reeds book, he writes that Dannenfelser told him: Trump was my last choice until he was my first.Washington Spectator - [How the CNP, a Republican Powerhouse, Helped Spawn Trumpism, Disrupted the Transfer of Power, and Stoked the Assault on the Capitol](https://washingtonspectator.org/nelson-cnp/)Operating from the shadows, [the Council for National Policys] members, who would number some 400, spent the next four decades courting, buying, and bullying fellow Republicans, gradually achieving what was in effect a leveraged buyout of the GOP.In 2016, the CNP put its partners money, data, and ground game behind Donald Trump, as the ultimate transactional candidate. Trump promised it retrograde social policies, a favorable tax regime, regulatory retreats, and its choice of federal judges. He delivered in spades. By 2020, the leaders of the CNP were ready to go to extreme lengths to keep himand themselvesin power.Donald Trump remained a dependable ally, asking only for an audience for his megalomania and a free pass for the business interests of the Trump brand. In return, he delivered his dynamism and his unshakeable base.Ultimate realization of the CNPs agenda depended on winning a second term for Trump in November. With another four years, it could enshrine its socially regressive policies on the federal level, further blur the line between church and state, and consolidate huge windfalls for corporations and wealthy individuals.","title":"Trump taps Russell Vought, key Project 2025 architect, to lead budget office"},{"text":"I dont know much about who donates to the transition, but I would assume Musk is putting up a substantial amount of money.

Murder is an act that directly and irreversibly violates another persons right to life. Speech, even when offensive or wrong, does not inherently cause the same kind of direct harmit operates in the realm of ideas, not physical violence.I should clarify I believe murder to be, on a fundamental moral level, far more severe than the act of simply expressing a point of view, no matter how objectionable. I do agree opinions don't \\"inherently\\" cause the same sort of direct harm.Your analogy fails because laws against murder are not about consensus on morality but about protecting individual rights.?Surely though the idea of \\"individual rights\\" and the right not to be harmed or killed is still a moral philosophical position? And if there was no consensus on the morality of murder - if, say, a majority dismissed the idea of \\"individual rights\\" here entirely - or, more generally, if murder just wasn't considered bad enough a thing to be made illegal - then surely there would be no law against it? Laws against murder are still a reflection of the general will of society. In order for murder to be illegal, society generally has to agree that it's \\"bad\\" enough to be a crime. I doubt every single person contributing to that consensus is simply appealing to the idea of \\"protecting individual rights\\" - they might have any number of reasons for thinking murder should be criminal. Moral, practical, ideological, or whatever. But the fact is that as a society we generally want murder to be outlawed and consequently it is.Banning Holocaust denial, for example, might seem justified because its so obviously false and offensive, but it sets a dangerous precedent. Who decides what other ideas are too dangerous to express?Again, it seems to me like the laws we do have, against murder, etc. still reflect societal consensus on whether these things should be illegal or not more than anything else. So the answer to your question would be, ideally, society. We decide - or somebody does, and very few of us object - when an action should be made illegal; when it is too dangerous to express. Why not apply the same principles we do to any other criminal behaviour when deciding what ideas are too dangerous?If the principle is that offensive or false speech can be banned, what happens when someone in power decides to use that same justification to silence criticism of the government, scientific dissent, or minority viewpoints? Free speech absolutism exists precisely because we cannot trust any authority to wield the power to censor speech fairly or impartially.But again, respectfully - you never see this sort of fearmongering when people are talking about other actions which are currently illegal. Nobody asks, \\"If the principle is that offensive or dangerous behaviour can be banned, what happens when someone in power decides to use that same justification to ban certain behaviour solely because it threatens the government's hold on power?\\" and thus concludes, \\"We cannot trust any authority to wield the power to outlaw behaviour fairly or impartially\\". I mean, nobody says this. About murder, or anything else - because we almost all think murder is something that deserves to be criminalised! For whatever reason. And that's justification enough. If we all, or almost all, can agree that Holocaust denial deserves to be banned, surely that should also be justification enough?Laws against murder protect individuals from direct physical harm. Laws protecting free speech protect society from intellectual stagnation and tyranny. To conflate the two is to fundamentally misunderstand their roles.Didn't you conflate their roles earlier when you said:Your analogy fails because laws against murder are not about consensus on morality but about protecting individual rights. Free speech laws serve the same purpose: they protect individuals from having their ideas silenced simply because they are unpopular or uncomfortable.?Also - I personally wasn't conflating laws against murder with laws protecting free speech, I was conflating (or equating) laws against murder with laws *against* (certain types/instances of) free speech.","title":"CMV: Free speech absolutism is rubbish"},{"text":"Dobbs-level pro-Republican backlashDo you mean if there were a trend in favor of Republicans against historical trends in the way 2022 was for Democrats?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 24, 2024"},{"text":"Oh no, there's so much accelerationist, Christian Zionist, etc influence in his weird inner circle, they are I am sure either not concerned with destroying the planet or are all for it.

There is no spectrum, there is two distinct forms of harm. Do you deny that psychological harm can be measured?It can be, but it is much more difficult, cause human emotions are difficult to analyse, and we are yet to form any sort of objective understanding.I just disagree that we can measure physical harm any better than we can measure psychological harm. The idea that we can perfectly assess physical harm is a joke.You can disagree with just about anything, doesn't mean you're right. Physical harm leaves evidence (hematoma, broken bones, wounds and scars), unless the damage is done in a specific way to avoid showing physical harm. Further, the argument here is about what is right and what is wrong, not what can be proven to exist or not. That is irrelevant.

Its not about him being qualified here, its about his loyalty to Trump. The other cabinet members he has put forth are concerning for a variety of valid reasons. The biggest one, however, is that he seems to be intentionally picking a lot of people who have publicly opposed him. More specifically, people who have publicly opposed him *who* also retracted those statements and later bent the knee to him. Rubio may have personal principles he believes in, but he is obviously more than willing to put them aside to stay in Trumps favor. We know that based on the fact he condemned Trump after J6, but today, he supports him openly and has backpedaled on his criticism of him, *hard*. As is the case with many others in the party and in this slate of cabinet picks. Like with other republicans who have done the same, its hard for me to extend much credit to them. The threat posed by Trump isnt lost on them, and yet, they decided that holding onto their own power and influence was preferable to standing up to him. Unfortunately, it is likely Rubio will continue catering to Trump, even it comes at his own expense, because its the only way he can stay in the GOP.

The alternative, at best, is the majority determining what is and isnt acceptable speech. So, like before they abolished slavery, the majority who supported slavery could have abolished speech against slavery. So you seem to be the sort of person who believes that that there is no objective moral difference between pedophilia, rape, murder, slavery, torture etc and producing food?I mean, if thats the evil you accept, then theres certainly no justification for protecting children from pedophiles never mind protecting freedom of speech.  But my sudden revelation just now was that nobody makes this argument about any other behaviour. I disagree with someone starting a business because I think it will fail, but I think they should have the right to do it. I disagree with someone wearing that shirt because I think it is ugly, but I think they should have the right to do it. I disagree with someone marrying the guy because hes awful, but I think they should have the right to do it. Generally, there are choices that people can make that are actually harmful to themselves but doesnt physically stop others from pursuing whats best for their life. Someone spouting nonsense holocaust denial doesnt stop me from learning whats true.  Nobody claims that because murder cant be proven to be objectively wrong, (and indeed a murderer might make the argument there was no problem with them murdering somebody), that laws against murder should be repealed. Thats because murder is objectively wrong. Murderers cant actually make valid/sound arguments for murder. And, despite the claims of people that murder isnt objectively wrong, no one is insane enough to propose the murder should be legalized. And, if people were that insane as to legalize murder, that would lead to the collapse of that society into an absolute hellhole regardless of peoples beliefs to the contrary. You cant even come close to having a decent society if murder was legal. Well, its more like some dictator would rise and ban murder similar to El Salvador.  The way we make laws is basically to say, theres enough consensus here among the people who live in this society that this thing is harmful enough to be banned, for us to ban it (bit of a simplification obviously, but I think generally true, especially when it comes to the fundamental laws almost everybody agrees with, like the ones against murder, rape, theft, etc.)  The expression of views considered almost universally abhorrent (like denial of the Holocaust) being banned, to me, seems to be exactly the same as any behaviour considered universally abhorrent enough to be banned (like murder) being made illegal. So, youve switched from harmful to abhorrent to here. Which is it? And votes are passed by a majority, 51%, or a super majority (60%, 67%, 75%). I wouldnt count that as almost universally abhorrent. If you take the population of the US and 75%, then something like 80 million people is 25% who dont agree.","title":"CMV: Free speech absolutism is rubbish"},{"text":"Yea my hopium has run completely dry.

Murder is illegal because it harms others, and generally speaking that kind of speech is illegal everywhere. Even in America you can't incite specific harm against people, and there are many other kinds of speech which are illegal. Nobody says, well, I know you think murder is wrong - but I think wearing a hat is wrong. Think how terrible it would be if you made it illegal for me to murder people.And nobody says that the freedom to say that there should be fewer immigrants from the Middle East because it erodes local cultural values and threatens public safety also means that people should be free to issue bomb threats.The obvious difference there is that wearing a hat doesn't cause harm and murder does. Opposing immigration doesn't cause harm (or that kind of harm is allowed) but bomb threats do. The way we make laws is basically to say, theres enough consensus here among the people who live in this society that this thing is harmful enough to be banned...In the case of Allison Pearson her tweet essentially was accusing people of being racist (in error it turns out). That isn't really something society has a consensus is harmful enough to be banned.The concern then is that someone is being harassed by government thugs for something that isn't a crime, or that the laws in place are so broad and selectively enforced that the government can go after nearly anyone and is just choosing to specifically silence this one columnist. Either of those cases seems problematic regardless of if you think Pearson is a dipshit. The expression of views considered almost universally abhorrent (like denial of the Holocaust) being banned, to me, seems to be exactly the same as any behaviour considered universally abhorrent enough to be banned (like murder) being made illegal.Can you articulate the specific **harm** caused by holocaust denial? Near universal disagreement, even disgust is not in itself a reason you have argued to ban a behavior.Some people want to eat their own poop. Even if that is nearly universally viewed as abhorrent does that imply it should be banned? Why? We can disagree on individual cases - about whether a *particular* point of view is bad enough to be banned from being expressed publicly - but to take a free speech absolutist position doesnt make sense to me.It doesn't make sense because you are misrepresenting/understanding what free speech absolutism means. It does not mean that any speech, including harmful speech, must be allowed.

Paraphrasing Hans Morgenthau, power is anything and everything that gives man domination over man and fundamentally domination is the ability to inflict pain in some form. If you can stall someone's career thats pain. If you can socially isolate them thats pain. The conceit about censorship is that you can limit your opponents response to the infliction to pain in the sphere you want. You might believe that you can socially shame someone but that they will not respond by trying to create a political power structure where they can regain first dominion over their speech and eventually domination over you. That is delusional. The infliction of pain naturally leads to a more ruthless politics by your opponent as inevitable fact of human nature. On the other hand if you don't try and enforce some degree of orthodoxy you get twitter. A lot of people have extreme ideas and if those ideas are normalized they will eventually come to be seen as legitimate solutions by people when times are bad. So you have a bit of a dilemma.If you go down the censorship route. Your opponents will accept increasingly ruthless and authoritarian tactics to prevent themselves from being censored because humans are highly motivated to prevent a loss of autonomy and the infliction of pain on them. Humans are naturally stubborn and most people are not going to switch their views due to censorship. If the group you are trying to censor is sufficiently large they will probably have the political power to inflict pain back on you. The reality is that its very easy to isolate a small fringe of society from speech by policing the most extreme deviations from orthodoxy IF your more moderate opponents believe that this censorship will not be expanded to encompass their views in the near future. Neo-Nazis were basically successfully marginalized for 40-50 years by informal censorship. Communists were widely prosecuted until McCarthy made liberals afraid that they were next.  The problem is that once you are trying to censor more than say 10% of the population the relative truce between factions breaks down. The expansion of Progressive ambition to make an increasing number of views outside the Overton window was extremely effective at uniting the Republican Party into a zero-sum idea of the culture war while breaking down the quarantine of the far-right from the general right. Thats the other problem maintaining some degree of censorship usually requires your opponents consent once that consent is gone the most extreme views you are trying to censor gradually break out of containment and join all of the views you are trying to censor in your opponents Overton Window.  I would say in 2024 it looks to have been widely ineffective as well. The Republicans will probably try something similar in the mere future and I doubt they will succeed for the same reasonsCensorship is a very powerful tool that only works when used sparingly to isolate the fringe. Ultimately other methods are necessary to change the more normative positions of your opponents and trying to use censorship to tackle a wider range of viewpoints usually backfires and leads to a more polarized authoritarian society","title":"CMV: Free speech absolutism is rubbish"},{"text":"... who quoted George Bush.It's not that they don't know or don't understand.

Now there are obviously back channels and the underground world where you can get assassinated/killed/etc. But talking about front of the house dealings, our society used to come from societies that held public executions and beatings. The average civilians walking by to see the spectacle were not kind to the people on display. Imagine eating lunch with your friends over and you say a joke that your dad would say at the dinner table. A lot of kids laugh but one of your friend doesn't and tells on his parents. Their parents tells the local police officer or w.e. Now in a lot of places, there was no cop. It was just the military. So imagine soldiers with rifles showing up to your door arresting your entire family and interrogating you. This is a reality some people live in. This is what a country with no free speech looks like.A lot of \\"free speech\\" activists today are not TRUE free speech activists. People you see go to places just to inflame riots or make provocative protests to defend their ability to say derogatory or hateful things is not really what free speech embodies. However, the same policy that protects YOUR right to criticize a shitty government is also what protects the rights of some horrible people. Trying to change the law and take everyone's rights away just so you can show these assholes what's up is going to be a hard sell to most of the moderates/centrists.Another major caveat with this country was religious freedom. People were escaping religious faith that held significant amount of power and criticizing religious organizations like the Catholic Church might not just mean trouble for you but your entire family or even the neighborhood.So there are a lot of things we take for granted. When at the time of writing the declaration of independence and the constitutional rights, a lot of this was very forward thinking. The forefathers tried their best to predict based on history the areas they needed to cover to have a functional republic where people can vote and practice democracy without being in fear of persecution for simply speaking up about policies they needed or to criticize policies they thought were terrible. And this was essentially the birth of political parties in this country.Now do I support the people who drone on and on about free speech TODAY? No. A lot of these people do not understand what free speech stands for and what it means. But again the same thing that protects your right to practice actual free speech is also what protects their right to express their shitty opinions. This is America. You're free to make the shitty decisions to ruin your own life within reason as long as they are not illegal.I won't get into the murder discussion because it's just ridiculous (if you kill someone, the people that loves that victim will now want to kill you, and then now when they kill you, someone that loves you will want to kill them; this is the spiral of murder/violence or some people call \\"in the forest\\" analogy; the objective morality here is that violence begets violence and can destroy a society) but the one about sacred; sacred literally means religious or holy.

Some close House races were decided by tiny margins which they could have made up with ease. For example, the Republican candidate won IA-01 by 800 votes and CO-08 by 2k votes. that's why the largest public opinion victory for republicans resulted in the slimmest of majorities in congress. Rs were much less popular in 2016 yet had a much larger majority for example.

Murder is an act that directly and irreversibly violates another persons right to life. Speech, even when offensive or wrong, does not inherently cause the same kind of direct harmit operates in the realm of ideas, not physical violence.The argument for free speech isnt that all speech is correct or harmless. In fact, the point is the opposite: people do have the right to say things that are wrong, offensive, or controversial, because the alternativeallowing governments or institutions to decide what is wrong or harmfulis far more dangerous. Unlike murder, where the harm is clear and tangible, the harm caused by speech is subjective and open to interpretation. What one group finds abhorrent, another might see as truth. If we begin to ban speech based on what the majorityor those in powerdeems harmful, we risk suppressing dissent, stifling debate, and enabling authoritarian control.Your analogy fails because laws against murder are not about consensus on morality but about protecting individual rights. Free speech laws serve the same purpose: they protect individuals from having their ideas silenced simply because they are unpopular or uncomfortable. History is littered with examples where the majority opinion was wrong, and it was only through free speech that progress was madeabolition of slavery, womens suffrage, civil rights, and LGBTQ+ rights all relied on the ability to express ideas that were once considered universally abhorrent.Banning Holocaust denial, for example, might seem justified because its so obviously false and offensive, but it sets a dangerous precedent. Who decides what other ideas are too dangerous to express? If the principle is that offensive or false speech can be banned, what happens when someone in power decides to use that same justification to silence criticism of the government, scientific dissent, or minority viewpoints? Free speech absolutism exists precisely because we cannot trust any authority to wield the power to censor speech fairly or impartially.Speech is sacred not because its harmless, but because its essential to democracy and human progress. The marketplace of ideasthe free exchange of perspectives, even offensive or wrong onesis the best tool we have for discerning truth. Bad ideas can only be defeated by better ideas, not by silencing them. Laws against murder protect individuals from direct physical harm. Laws protecting free speech protect society from intellectual stagnation and tyranny. To conflate the two is to fundamentally misunderstand their roles.","title":"CMV: Free speech absolutism is rubbish"},{"text":"I would have expected it was the crayon eating one, Eric.

Also, [green energy jobs outnumber fossil fuel jobs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2022/06/29/clean-energy-jobs-are-booming-making-up-for-rising-fossil-fuel-unemployment/) in the U.S. by far. The only thing keeping fossil fuels alive in the U.S. are dark oil money and red state politicians reliant on that money.","title":"Donald Trump wants to revive long-dead Keystone XL pipeline as he pushes fossil-fuel agenda"},{"text":"Some key points below:After Donald Trump won this months election, one of the first things he did was to name two unelected male plutocrats, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, to run a new Department of Government Efficiency. The yet-to-be-created entitys acronym, DOGE, is something of a jokea reference to a cryptocurrency named for an internet meme involving a Shiba Inu. But its appointed task of reorganizing the federal bureaucracy and slashing its spending heralds a new political arrangement in Washington: a broligarchy, in which tremendous power is flowing to tech and finance magnates, some of whom appear indifferent or even overtly hostile to democratic tradition.The broligarchs ranks also include the PayPal and Palantir co-founder Peter ThielVice PresidentCElect J. D. Vances mentor, former employer, and primary financial backeras well as venture capitalists like Marc Andreessen and David Sacks, both of whom added millions of dollars to Trumps campaign. Musk, to be sure, is the archetype. The worlds richest man has reportedly been sitting in on the president-elects calls with at least three heads of foreign states: Ukraines Volodymyr Zelensky, Serbias Aleksandar Vu?i?, and Turkeys Recep Tayyip Erdo?an. Musk joined Trump in welcoming Argentine President Javier Milei at Mar-a-Lago and, according to The New York Times, met privately in New York with Irans ambassador to the United Nations in a bid to defuse tensions between that country and the United States. Recently, after Musk publicly endorsed the financier Howard Lutnick for secretary of the Treasury, some in Trumps camp were concerned that Musk was acting as a co-president, The Washington Post reported....Many broligarchs also see themselves as exceptional beings, but arrived at that view through a different path: via science fiction, fantasy literature, and comic books. Ideas from these genres have long pervaded Silicon Valley culture; last year, Andreessen published a manifesto calling for Becoming Technological Supermen, defined by embarking on a Heros Journey and conquering dragons.Superhero narratives also appear to inform many of Musks more eccentric political views, including his reported belief that the superintelligent have a duty to reproduce, and may help explain why in September he reposted a claim that a Republic of high status males would be superior to our current democracy. Last week, Musk likened Matt Gaetz, Trumps then-nominee for attorney general, to Judge Dredd, a dystopian comic-book character authorized to conduct summary executions. Musk seems to have meant this as a compliment. He described Gaetzwho, until his resignation from the House, was under a congressional investigation in connection with an alleged sex-trafficking schemeas our Hammer of Justice.Whatever its source, the broligarchs sense of their innate superiority has led many of them to positions on taxation quite similar to Trumps. In 2016, the Republican presidential nominee bragged about avoiding tax payments for yearsThat makes me smart, he crowed from the debate stage. The broligarchs have quietly liberated themselves from one of the only certainties in life. As ProPublica reported in 2021, Musk paid zero federal income taxes in 2018 and a de facto tax rate of 3.3 percent from 2014 to 2018, during which his wealth grew $13.9 billion. Thiel used a government program intended to expand retirement savings by middle-class Americans to amass $5 billion in capital-gains income, completely tax-free. The Trump-friendly broligarchs political ascendancy turns the rallying cry of the Boston Tea Party on its head, achieving representation with minimal taxation.In their hostility to taxation and regulation, the men who rule Wall Street and Silicon Valley resemble earlier generations of wealthy capitalists who enjoyed outsize influence on American politics. Even some tech barons who supported Kamala Harris clamored for the firing of Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, who favors vigorous antitrust enforcement. But the broligarchs are distinct from old-school American oligarchs in one key respect: Their political vision seeks to undermine the nation-state system globally. Musk, among others, has set his sights on the privatization and colonization of space with little or no government involvement. Thiel and Andreessen have invested heavily in creating alternatives to the nation-state here on Earth, including libertarian colonies with minimal taxation. One such colony is up and running in Honduras; Thiel has also invested in efforts to create artificial islands and other autonomous communities to serve as new outposts for private governance. The nature of government is about to change at a very fundamental level, Thiel said of these initiatives in 2008.The coming new gilded age is becoming very real, and the efforts to not just gain power but undermine nation-states globally will, if unchecked, likely lead to worse outcomes for all but the wealthiest and well-connected.","title":"What the Broligarchs Want from Trump | Tremendous power is flowing to tech and finance magnates"},{"text":"Absolute betrayal from Adam Schiff.","title":"Marco Rubio is unquestionably qualified to serve in Trumps Cabinet, says Democrat Adam Schiff"},{"text":"Its the finale contingency- self destruct.

So to compensate, they zoned everything for business (therefore, housing crisis).Trump wants to lower taxes for billionaires, which pay a LOT of taxes. Therefore, personal income tax will go up, and tariffs will go up, which is essentially a sales tax.

All communist countries did it, and those in place are still doing it. And it's extremely effective - if people cannot express freely what they think, it's extremely easy to control the national narrative.3) Limiting people's ability to express themselves only radicalizes them in their opinions.

Markets will chose the 8.50 version most often. So we put a 5 dollar tariff on imported widgets. Now the Chinese version costs 12.50 at retail. And the American widget costs 10. Here is the kicker; since the American companies competition cannot go below 12.50, it will raise its prices to 12.49. People will still buy theirs because its cheaper. But the net effect is the tariff raised the cost of widgets in the us by 5 dollars, or in this case something like 70%. The US business is now raking in the dough. As their profit margins have gone up by several hundred percent. It will be years before another company gets their competition to market. So inflation is essentially made permanent by these tariffs. The political cost of removing them and allowing the Chinese company to compete with the American company to lower the cost of the widget and reverse the inflation is too high.

The transition team now moved into an office in downtown Washington, DC, and went looking for people to occupy the top five hundred jobs in the federal government. They needed to fill all the cabinet positions, of course, but also a whole bunch of others that no one in the Trump campaign even knew existed.The first time Donald Trump paid attention to [the fact that the transition team raised money in order to fund the transition] was when he read about it in the newspaper. The story revealed that Trumps very own transition team, led by New Jersey governor Chris Christie, had raised several million dollars to pay the staff. The moment he saw it, Trump called Steve Bannon, the chief executive of his campaign, from his office, on the twenty-sixth floor of Trump Tower, and told him to come immediately to his residence, many floors above. Bannon stepped off the elevator to find the governor of New Jersey seated on a sofa, being hollered at. Trump was apoplectic, actually yelling, Youre stealing my money! Youre stealing my fucking money! What the fuck is this?? Seeing Bannon, Trump turned on him and screamed, Why are you letting him steal my fucking money? Bannon and Christie together set out to explain to Trump federal law.Months before the electionthe nominees of the two major parties were expected to prepare to take control of the government. The government supplied them with office space in downtown Washington, DC, along with computers and trash cans and so on, but the campaigns paid their people. To which Trump replied, Fuck the law. I dont give a fuck about the law. I want my fucking money. Bannon and Christie tried to explain that Trump couldnt have both his money and a transition. Shut it down, said Trump. Shut down the transition.  The money that people donated to his campaign Trump considered, effectively, his own. He thought the planning and forethought pointless. At one point he turned to Christie and said, Chris, you and I are so smart that we can leave the victory party two hours early and do the transition ourselves.  Bannon wasnt so sure if Trump would ever get his mind around running the federal government: he just thought it would look bad if Trump didnt at least seem to prepare. Seeing that Trump wasnt listening to Christie, he said, What do you think Morning Joe will sayif you shut down your transition? What Morning Joe would sayor at least what Bannon thought it would saywas that Trump was closing his presidential transition office because he didnt think he had any chance of being president. Trump stopped hollering. For the first time he seemed actually to have listened. That makes sense, he said.The next hint that the transition might not go as planned came from Mike Pence. Now, incredibly, Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Christie met with Pence the day after the election, to discuss the previous lists of people who had been vetted for jobs. The meeting began with a prayer, followed by Pences first, ominous question: Why isnt Puzder on the list for Labor? Andrew Puzder, the head of CKE Restaurants, the holding company for Hardees and Carls Jr., wanted to be the secretary of labor. Christie explained that Puzders ex-wife had accused him of abuse, and his fast-food restaurant employees had complained of mistreatment. Even if he was somehow the ideal candidate to become the next secretary of labor, he wouldnt survive his Senate confirmation hearings. (Trump ignored the advice and nominated Puzder. In the controversy that followed, Puzder not only failed to be confirmed but stepped down from his job at the fast-food company.) *The Fifth Risk,* Michael Lewis","title":"White House: Trump Team Still Hasnt Signed Transition Docs"},{"text":"My district got re-gerrymandered and she's no longer my rep, which is a shame because she's terrific.","title":"Trump-backed Derek Merrin concedes to Democratic U.S. Rep.

Stop coddling this jackass voting population.No, they whined about democracy being on the line and then took the democratic process away from us and put in the 2nd weakest candidate. It's quite literally the meme of the person on the bike sticking the branch in their spokes and then crying in the ground saying, \\"why did the horrible electorate do this to us?\\"And now you can fellatiate a microphoneHe represents a middle finger to the system (even though he is just as much of a \\"swamp creature\\" himself. Breaking of some decorum kind of goes along with it. To many, it is funny when the media hand wrings about stupid things. Many Dems fail to understand thisand operate the fryer at a McDonald'sYou say that as if it is a negative thing. It's this pompousness that contributed to the loss. You speak a bit later of trying to get as many votes as possible. That was way more effective at reaching voters than lying (probably) about working at McDonald's.Times change, get with them. Trump is a unique character in our modern politics, the amount of lack of decorum won't work for any other politician for a long timeThis is the most hindsight is 20/20 line ever. Honestly, the rest of that paragraph is barely veiled \\"I told you so\\" smugness being disguised as devil's advocacy. It is awful devil's advocacy.It's not hindsight if I was saying it at the time as well. It was all true. Ignore it and you put yourself in a similar position next time around.You're blaming her for trying to get as many votes as possible to get Trump out of the way?No, she should be trying to get as many votes as possible. But every politician knows it takes a delicate balance of keeping your own voters happy enough to come out and vote for you while reaching out to new voters. Instead Harris stepped on the face of many of her voters while reaching out to the mythical (or very small sliver of) Liz Cheney voters. The majority of her base wanted some sort of change in Gaza and she campaigned with the daughter of the man who was very responsible for the killing of an insane number of Arabs. I didn't know that the modern Republican Party is just a sea of MAGAs before November 5th, and you didn't either, don't even trying saying you knewYou fundamentally misunderstand the electorate. Just because someone voted for Trump doesn't mean hey are MAGA. That's silly. There is a combination of MAGA, I can't vote for any Democrat, I can't vote for Harris, people who liked RFK's crazy ideas, people who liked Tulsi Gabbard, and various other reasons. Your oversimplification os a \\"sea of MAGA\\" deflects all blame and ignores the OBVIOUS weaknesses that Harris and the Dem establishment presented this cycle.No, you ignore it because a vice president literally can't do anything other than break ties. Again, that is foolish. That is the literal guide to tell you exactly what the public thinks of her at that moment. The \\"can't do anything\\" is just cope. Literally no one is thinking \\"you know, I would like Harris if she could do more than just break ties\\" or \\"she's doing a bad job as VP, I sure would like to see her as president. You have dug yourself in so deep you refuse to accept a single piece of reality.Yeah, this is some real 20/20 hindsight you're oozing. I bet you wouldn't be mouthing this stuff off if she'd won, you're putting the cart before the horse. Of course it's hindsight to say that her losing with the well run campaign. It wasn't evidence at the time but it is solid evidence now. Which is it: was she so bad that she lost with a well run campaign or was it not as well run of a campaign than you thought? This election was winnable. It was sad that that it was even close.If she would have won by a lot (which a good candidate should have), I would eat crow and say I was wrong. If she barely won by 2020 margins, I would have said that we were lucky and Trump won the unpopularity contest. There was a reason RFK was polling high at the beginning. People hated both Trump and Biden.No, that's precisely the point. You wouldn't have gone into that spiel about Bernie if it wasn't. I directly torpedoed youNo, that is the point that you constructed in your head and knocked down and then patted yourself on the back. My point was exactly what I said it was: that she was so weak in 2020 that she had to drop out organically, before the scramble by the establishment forced other candidates out. It's a huge and important distinction. Dropping out because no one wanted you is different than polling decently but having to drop out to team up against Bernie. Address the actual argument, rather than the one you projected onto me.Kamala took a stance on attacking corporations for price gouging.Yes, that was one of the few things she did well. Too bad her well run campaign buried her ads that talked about this because her donors didn't like it. Even though they polled well, they decided not to run the ads so as not to upset the donors.Anyways, essentially your entire spiel- the reason you're still here- is that you're trying to disguise your \\"I told you so\\" mentality, even though you're really just speaking from hindsight.No, I was saying pretty much all of this stuff (aside from the Biden campaign) during the time. It's not hindsight if you knew in the moment. My whole point of all of this is to avoid the mistakes that were just made in the next cycle. If we bury our heads in the sand, like you and many others are trying to do, then we are doomed when the next worse than Trump Republican runs and the Dems pull all the same bullshit that they didn't learn from.

Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience. Now is a good time to do so. Here are twenty lessons from the twentieth century, adapted to the circumstances of today.  \\n  \\n  \\n20 Lessons from the 20th Century  \\n  \\n  \\n1. Do not obey in advance. Much of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then start to do it without being asked. Youve already done this, havent you? Stop. Anticipatory obedience teaches authorities what is possible and accelerates unfreedom.  \\n  \\n  \\n2. Defend an institution. Follow the courts or the media, or a court or a newspaper. Do not speak of our institutions unless you are making them yours by acting on their behalf. Institutions dont protect themselves. They go down like dominoes unless each is defended from the beginning.  \\n  \\n  \\n3. Recall professional ethics. When the leaders of state set a negative example, professional commitments to just practice become much more important. It is hard to break a rule-of-law state without lawyers, and it is hard to have show trials without judges.  \\n  \\n  \\n4. When listening to politicians, distinguish certain words. Look out for the expansive use of terrorism and extremism. Be alive to the fatal notions of exception and emergency. Be angry about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary.  \\n  \\n  \\n5. Be calm when the unthinkable arrives. When the terrorist attack comes, remember that all authoritarians at all times either await or plan such events in order to consolidate power. Think of the Reichstag fire. The sudden disaster that requires the end of the balance of power, the end of opposition parties, and so on, is the oldest trick in the Hitlerian book. Dont fall for it.  \\n  \\n  \\n6. Be kind to our language. Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does. Think up your own way of speaking, even if only to convey that thing you think everyone is saying. (Dont use the internet before bed. Charge your gadgets away from your bedroom, and read.) What to read? Perhaps The Power of the Powerless by Vclav Havel, 1984 by George Orwell, The Captive Mind by Czes?aw Milosz, The Rebel by Albert Camus, The Origins of Totalitarianism by Hannah Arendt, or Nothing is True and Everything is Possible by Peter Pomerantsev.  \\n  \\n  \\n7. Stand out. Someone has to. It is easy, in words and deeds, to follow along. It can feel strange to do or say something different. But without that unease, there is no freedom. And the moment you set an example, the spell of the status quo is broken, and others will follow.  \\n  \\n  \\n8. Believe in truth. To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power, because there is no basis upon which to do so. If nothing is true, then all is spectacle. The biggest wallet pays for the most blinding lights.  \\n  \\n  \\n9. Investigate. Figure things out for yourself. Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative journalism by subscribing to print media. Realize that some of what is on your screen is there to harm you. Learn about sites that investigate foreign propaganda pushes.  \\n  \\n  \\n10. Practice corporeal politics. Power wants your body softening in your chair and your emotions dissipating on the screen. Get outside. Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people. Make new friends and march with them.  \\n  \\n  \\n11. Make eye contact and small talk. This is not just polite. It is a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, break down unnecessary social barriers, and come to understand whom you should and should not trust. If we enter a culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological landscape of your daily life.  \\n  \\n  \\n12. Take responsibility for the face of the world. Notice the swastikas and the other signs of hate. Do not look away and do not get used to them. Remove them yourself and set an example for others to do so.  \\n  \\n  \\n13. Hinder the one-party state. The parties that took over states were once something else. They exploited a historical moment to make political life impossible for their rivals. Vote in local and state elections while you can.  \\n  \\n  \\n14. Give regularly to good causes, if you can. Pick a charity and set up autopay. Then you will know that you have made a free choice that is supporting civil society helping others doing something good.  \\n  \\n  \\n15. Establish a private life. Nastier rulers will use what they know about you to push you around. Scrub your computer of malware. Remember that email is skywriting. Consider using alternative forms of the internet, or simply using it less. Have personal exchanges in person. For the same reason, resolve any legal trouble. Authoritarianism works as a blackmail state, looking for the hook on which to hang you. Try not to have too many hooks.  \\n  \\n  \\n16. Learn from others in other countries. Keep up your friendships abroad, or make new friends abroad. The present difficulties here are an element of a general trend. And no country is going to find a solution by itself. Make sure you and your family have passports.  \\n  \\n  \\n17. Watch out for the paramilitaries. When the men with guns who have always claimed to be against the system start wearing uniforms and marching around with torches and pictures of a Leader, the end is nigh. When the pro-Leader paramilitary and the official police and military intermingle, the game is over.  \\n  \\n  \\n18. Be reflective if you must be armed. If you carry a weapon in public service, God bless you and keep you. But know that evils of the past involved policemen and soldiers finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things. Be ready to say no. (If you do not know what this means, contact the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and ask about training in professional ethics.)  \\n  \\n  \\n19. Be as courageous as you can. If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die in unfreedom.  \\n  \\n  \\n20. Be a patriot. The incoming president is not. Set a good example of what America means for the generations to come. They will need it.  \\n  \\n  \\nTimothy Snyder is the Bird White Housum Professor of History at Yale University and a Permanent Fellow at the IWM.  \\n  \\n  \\n?

This model maximizes the economical stability as company can make tougher decisions when problems arise. Owner risks the outcome with his own investment and workers not - that is why they are able to get more.The issue starts when we allow the same market initiatives to take over parts that aren't bound by the rules of market. Housing, education, food production etc. are sectors that enable country to be stable as they are responsible for safety nets in case of failure. And they are rigid - you can't really have more houses than people, more schools than students in area or more patients than sick people. The main driving force of capitalism - expanding the market is just not possible. We need to assume that base level of those needs to be secured by government in some form. US currently falls flat on that, other counties mitigate it to varying degree.As the productivity per person grows, the safety nets should grow - because we want a situation where people who want to do something are ones that take risks and succeed, while those who are comfortable at a level should be able to maintain it. Full redistribution of profits or full representation of workers in a company are going to have negative outcomes for the same workers. Solution is taxation that prevents people from falling destitute and gives them a way out of poverty.","title":"CMV: Americans should have to take a basic knowledge test before being able to vote"},{"text":"not sure a strike is what they meant. think more robes pee air.","title":"White House: Trump Team Still Hasnt Signed Transition Docs"},{"text":"Republicans advocated for something similar not too long ago (though it wasnt a large movement).

What about this is so hard to understand? Why didn't they cheat enough in three of the ten or so House races which Republicans won by a margin of less than 2%Maybe because Rs actually won those by much larger margins and there was no way to make up the difference. And each locality is different and has different people doing the count. Not all of them would be activist. You'll see the usual suspects all flipped seats for dems that's why the largest public opinion victory for republicans resulted in the slimmest of majorities in congress. Rs were much less popular in 2016 yet had a much larger majority for example.

I think it's a logistical nightmare and unrealistic.Unless you could create a country where each school district has an equal economy, you'd get variation in quality in education I'd imagine.You can move the same school to a zone with a worse economy, and the school performance is worse. This happens where I live in Europe. Some schools are owned by private businesses but are free, public and subsidised by the government. But all their systems and processes remain the same. So the same school effectively duplicates across the country, and they get varying results.The equal access to the same education standard is there. But so much depends on student behaviour, which can depend on parents, which can depend on the upbringing and education of parents etc. Classes are also learning at the speed of the lowest common denominator, so classes get separated between worse performers and better performers - and although this access isn't equal, it allows everybody to get the best results possible, for as far as what they're willing to put in.I have no idea how the education system works in the US. I like the education system I had in the UK and I think it's about as good a system as you could get. Haven't been to university (college) so I couldn't comment there.

My new pastor friends despair really drove home that point - true good gets trampled by the bad, time and time again. And naturally, those of us whose anger arises from a place of sadness and disillusionment with the cruel and hateful nature of humanity, are the ones most prone to turning that anger inward and experiencing depression.Around me I see church-going MAGA folk going about their lives as if everything is sunshine and roses. So-called Southern charm and hospitality, rooted in their supposed love for Jesus. And Ive retreated on account of being completely sickened by it all. The saddest part for me is when we hear all the propaganda and accusations from the Right, saying that we on the Left are arrogant and perceive ourselves as morally superior - I dont consider myself to be an angel by any means, but the fact remains that the most good Ive truly ever seen in my life is that from faith-oriented Liberals. Open-minded people who actively seek out opportunities to serve their communities, and who are raising children who recognize both their own privilege and their obligation to help others. They do exist, but are unfortunately quite rare.Im lucky in the sense that my husband is great at compartmentalizing and self-preservation - as a South American  immigrant with darker skin and a noticeable accent, in a high-level leadership position over mostly white Conservative males, hes leaning in and play the game. Which should greatly benefit us financially and allow me to continue seeking out the good.

In fact the US government would prefer the standard of living to be as low as possible so the goods are as cheap as possible which keeps food prices down and prevents poor people in the US from complaining too much. The reason I said it isn't a core strategic interest is that the US can actually grow most of its own food and imports mostly from countries much closer for obvious reasons. Ukraine is much more important to European countries than to the US which is really why we helped them in the first place. We do look after our European allies' interests but not with a great deal of enthusiasm. Congress realistically can't be trusted to follow through financially on supporting our overseas obligations. Maybe that is a sign that we are overextended but I don't think we will change our ways soon. Personally I think this whole war was a result of miscalculation on the part of Obama/Clinton and later Biden about how to address Russia. We still had a foreign policy mindset that would could get our way all the time without consequences. Obviously that is not the case. We should have come to a long term agreement to keep Ukraine a neutral country that had close ties with both Western Europe and Russia to prevent this kind of war. Ukraine is a core strategic interest of Russia. Remember how the US reacted to Cuba being in the Soviet orbit. In terms of real politics Ukraine being in NATO is actually a bigger threat to Russia than the Cuban missile crisis was to the US as defending against a land invasion from Ukraine into Russia would be very difficult. Wars are generally speaking the failure of diplomacy. Sometimes the conflicts don't have another possible resolution but I would need some serious convincing to believe that about this conflict as opposed to say the American Civil war. Even the American Revolution was super preventable. I actually find it quite likely that Trump did sell the secrets but again, it was to people who he would consider potential collaborators. Ukraine also has large offshore oil deposits that both the US and Russia want access to. this war is all about resources and which bloc of nations has access to them. In truth all of this is just the rich and powerful playing games with other people's lives for their own enrichment and empowerment. No matter who wins or loses its regular people who had no say in causing these wars who do the fighting, dying and suffering.","title":"CMV: The U.S. will no longer be an independent nation by the end of this decade, and this is a sober view."},{"text":"The 10 advertisements I got every week said trump knows nothing on project 2025 AND disavows it!","title":"Trump taps Russell Vought, key Project 2025 architect, to lead budget office"},{"text":"so then you shouldn't really be the one making decisions that effect the rest of us who do actually want the world to be livable in the future","title":"CMV: We should find short-term solutions to climate change and throw future generations under the bus so that current young generations get to live as good as the boomers did"},{"text":"But but the price of eggs??","title":"Trump allies eye overhauling Medicaid, food stamps in tax legislation"},{"text":"Maybe it's time to just shut down social media platforms.

Something has seriously gone wrong.Democrats have their own flaws that have pushed voters away as well... No they are not perfect,. and should nto have to be , but they have some major flaws that give a bad impression and they have become unreliable to a point. They need to stop being Republican Light.. I dont care if some people think they should actually go further right, no. I think the apathy came from Democrats always doing the bare minimum and sometimes not even that, they follow the rules for the most part and all that, but the status quo is not enough anymore, people want change, people want progression. I think so many people decided not to vote because they were led to believe the Democrats were just talking the talk, but refusing to walk the walk, and while yes Biden did some great stuff, there was so much more he could have done but chose not to.   \\nTrump promised extreme things, while those extreme things are terrible, they spoke to his base, he got his base fired up , even if it is just their desire to always be mad at everyone and their freedom to harass and bully others for b eing different. He spoke to them.  \\nDemocrats needed to find a way to reach their voters , and they could not. They kept trying to please everyone and that resulted in pleasing no one.

People continued to be able to spend money during the pandemic, despite the fact that there was a shortage of everything, from groceries to clothing to electronics. With demand being the same as always (or more), prices naturally went up. World events also didnt help; Russias war on Ukraine strained global grain and oil supplies, the Suez Canal being blocked for a week caused knock-on issues that lasted for months, and many other things coincided to keep prices up. In addition, I think straight-up corporate consolidation and profiteering played a role; this is something the Biden administration has actively fought against. It also didnt help that, even as money was flowing into the economy and demand was rising, the Fed was keeping interest rates extremely low, further making it easier for people and businesses to get money. Its hard to fault them in retrospect, since they stuck a soft landing thus year, but you have to wonder what the tradeoff they were dealing was - short-term inflation to keep people fed and housed, or much more pain to keep the economy from overheating. In any case, Biden - or any other president - has no control over the Feds actions, and it should stay that way.","title":"Trumps Republican Party is increasingly winning union voters.

Even if each individual measurement is noisy and wrong, they will tend to center on the true answer.Wat scientists typically do *not* do is try to get a very small amount of 'good' data instead.  This is because trying to pick out the 'good' data can introduce *systematic* bias, which does *not* leave you centered on the true answer underneath the noise.  You could be mistaken about which data is 'good', your method for finding the 'good' data could include an error that alters the measurement, the thing that makes the data 'good' could be a third factor that also alters it, etc.If you let 100,000,000 truly ignorant people vote in a two party system, about a third of them will vote for party A, about a third will vote for party B, and about a third will not vote.  They tend to cancel each other out, and it doesn't hurt that you let them vote.If you try to only let 'the right people' vote, then *no matter how you choose the 'right' people*, you will be opening yourself to systematic bias.Like, forget the obvious opening this creates for corruption and designing a test that favors your own voters; that's how it *would* fail immediately in reality, but lets pretend everyone designing and administering the test is a perfect angel forever into the future.Maybe the 'right' people are almost never farm workers, and are ignorant on that one specific topic, and your agricultural policy collapses.Maybe the 'right' people overwhelmingly live in cities, and everyone in the country suffers for their picks.Maybe the 'right' people tend to be much older because you are testing some knowledge that accumulates over time, and the rate of social/political progress drops tremendously.Maybe the 'right' people tend to have a different religion or moral system from the rest, and implement things that the rest genuinely dislike on valid moral and aesthetic grounds.Maybe one party already has control of the school system, and can teach the answers to the test to students in their own areas while not teaching it to students in opposed areas, corrupting the test without writing it.Etc.  Reducing the value of someone's vote instead of failing them certainly mitigates these effects, but only to the exact same extent it mitigates the intended value of having a test in the first place.  You are still pushing towards some kind of systematic bias, importantly a systematic bias that *you cannot predict ahead of time*, by filtering your own data like this.That's why scientists don't do it.","title":"CMV: Americans should have to take a basic knowledge test before being able to vote"},{"text":"Russian Money there fixed it for you.","title":"Trump Is Running His Transition Team on Secret Money"},{"text":"I'm with you on that.

This isn't even a hint of a plan, this is a wild guess at the possible existence of an undefined plan later; characterizing it as Trump himself having a definite plan to purge disloyalists isn't even hyperbole, it's a lie.I can conclude that over the next years every U.S. ICBM silo location will be revealed, in addition to the location of every nuclear submarine, as there will be no accountability left in the military.US ICBM silos have been visible by satellite for decades, and nuclear subs are constantly on the move while out of radio contact; literally no one not on board actually knows where they are. Russia already has effectively the same information on them as the President now.Following the nullification of U.S. nuclear strength, we will see a flow of information from the Pentagon to the Kremlin so catastrophic, it will be on par with the Enigma decryption, thus ending the decades long struggle between the U.S. and Russia with a Russian victory. The U.S. will collapse into multiple states or become a Russian satellite state....What?1. A disarming nuclear strike is literally impossible. Firing nukes into the ocean won't hurt a nuclear sub thousands of feet down, even if you did magically determine its position, and Russia doesn't have anywhere near enough submarines of its own to kill all of ours at once.\\n2. Firing nukes at the US would instantly trigger NATO to invade and destroy Russia. Considering that they're unable to take out a country vastly smaller and weaker than itself even after years, while the country is supported with nothing more than NATO's castoffs, can you even imagine that they'd stand up to a determined push from NATO itself? This would be literal suicide by Putin.\\n3. Trump's last administration was already so leaky that we got transcripts of private calls and meetings. Can you even imagine that everyone would somehow manage to keep quiet while leaking our entire collection of national intelligence to them?\\n4. Even if that did somehow happen, how exactly would this turn the US into a satellite state? It could be argued that having direct control of Trump would turn the US into a puppet state, but not really; the President has wide power, but is ultimately constrained by Congress and the courts and would have extremely hard limits on what he'd actually be able to do.Independent nation = all 50 U.S. states and territories as one country with a head of state that isnt influenced by other nations.All nations have some level of influence over each other.

It's extremely unlikely that he'd even face criminal charges after leaving office; it's not as if it would be even unlikely for Russia to release disinformation to cause internal chaos here. How does this actually affect his position?They key point I want to highlight here is not that he was just withholding funds to make Ukraine play along with his conspiracy, it was a coverup to slowly poison the public image of Ukraine to make withdrawing any U.S. support in the future easier, thus directly aiding Russia in their military campaigns.He made a single offhanded comment during a single phone call *that was never intended for public release*! That's not what a coverup is, and not how a public image campaign works.

It was released all of nine months into Trump's Presidency, and commented on problems with their own internal processes that had been plaguing them for years:Acknowledging that recruiting spies is a high-risk business, the cable raised issues that have plagued the agency in recent years, including poor tradecraft; being too trusting of sources; underestimating foreign intelligence agencies, and moving too quickly to recruit informants while not paying enough attention to potential counterintelligence risks  a problem the cable called placing mission over security.You can't blame this on Trump unless you believe that he somehow took control over the CIA's internal affairs years before taking office.Trump has now tapped Tulsi Gabbard to be Director of National Intelligence.If he actually wanted her to influence foreign policy, he'd have tapped her for Secretary of State, ambassador to Russia, or similar office that actually can control our response to Russia. Yes, the DNI has some level of indirect influence, but nowhere near the level of control she could have.Continued in comment, since Reddit has decided that it won't let me post anything too long.","title":"CMV: The U.S. will no longer be an independent nation by the end of this decade, and this is a sober view."},{"text":"Dude, youre speaking too intelligently for these folks.

If he manages to do that with his current majority, it would be a miracle, and he'd have probably north of a million very pissed off veterans who would be out of work, and have one man to blame for it. That's how you create insurgencies.","title":"Trump's vow to use US troops for mass deportations could face intense resistance  starting from within the military"},{"text":"He wasnt really an excellent president though.

Here's why, Hitler was a Christian. He demonized the immigrants in his country Jews. Sound like someone? They went after LGBTQ people and especially trans people. Their hate, their disgust for people not like them, not from Germany, was very well known and you can still read about it if you need a history lesson. Some of the same language, down to quotes, has been spoken not just by Trump, but my by the many racists and extremists who circle him. So run away idgaf. I'm not a Democrat. IDK what you do. But know this...the only good Nazi is a dead one. Converting them or changing their views never seems to work.

A US boomer sub surfaces ever so often partly to refuel (they're all nuclear and thus don't need to refuel, but the crew needs fresh food), partly to signal they're still around, then dives down and can then no longer be found, unless it decides to reveal itself. Even if the Russians had the exact plans to the sub, they couldn't find them because there's no technology they have that could find one.The US nuclear triad also encompasses a third leg, the aircraft launched nuclear bombs, whose locations are *also* known by treaty and spycraft.Lastly, the US already knows the location of every Russian silo and warhead, and probably has a decent guess at where the Russian subs are - who are much fewer in number, and their stealth tech is way worse and the US detection tech much better. There's a decent chance every Russian SLBM sub is constantly shadowed by two American attack submarines.Your horror scenario for the US *already applies to Russia*.And while Russia has parity, more or less, with the US on the nuclear front (ignoring for now the US' NATO allies, with France and the UK owning enough SLBM firepower to kill a hundred million Russians every day of the week), Russia is a much weaker state on every other level. It's much poorer, its conventional military might is a mere fraction of the US (again ignoring NATO allies), it's corrupt, it's technologically behind, it's diplomatically isolated, it's in a strategically terrible position - that's why the Russians are so paranoid, they're surrounded by enemies (Poland, Ukraine, the Baltics and Finland are not a day's worth of tank travel away from Moscow and St Petersburg), compared to the US which is the mightiest nation in the world on any metric and in a *fantastic* geostrategic position - protected by two vast oceans and on a continent with friends.So, on every metric the Russians are *already at this time* in a worse situation than the US would be if your horror scenario - its entire nuclear arsenal revealed - came true; its nuclear arsenal *is already revealed*, and everything else about it is terrible, whereas everything about the US is in fact enviable.Nevertheless Russia has its territorial integrity uncompromised, it is in fact expanding.How then would the US fall apart when it changed from \\"way, way, way safer than Russia on any metric\\" to \\"way, way safer than Russia on any metric but for one, on which it's now only somewhat safer than Russia\\"?On the other hand:Independent nation = all 50 U.S. states and territories as one country with a head of state that isnt influenced by other nations.I think there's around a 2% chance there'll be 51 or 52 states after Trump buys Greenland, or Puerto Rico becomes a state or DC.And: *every* head of state, including Kim Yong Un, is influenced by other nations.

They are part of a larger cyclical \\"saeculum\\" (a long human life, which usually spans around 85 years, although some saecula have lasted longer). The theory states that a crisis recurs in American history after every saeculum, which is followed by a recovery (high). During this recovery, institutions and communitarian values are strong. Ultimately, succeeding generational archetypes attack and weaken institutions in the name of autonomy and individualism, which eventually creates a tumultuous political environment that ripens conditions for another crisis.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss%E2%80%93Howe_generational_theory?wprov=sfla1","title":"Biden must Trump-proof US democracy, activists say: There is a sense of urgency"},{"text":"Gee, I wonder why they didnt mention this before the election.
