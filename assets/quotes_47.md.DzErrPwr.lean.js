We should just stay in line so that doesn't happen to us!\\"I don't preach anything i don't practice, but even if I did, I'm not the one complaining about this stuff, and also unwilling to starve the system of the money being provided to do it. I'm absolutely not only thinking of the best case scenario. I have accepted the ugly truth of the worst-case scenario. I just weigh the spiritual implications of paying them against the likely outcome of being put in a cage for going against the grain, and to me, it's an easy choice.\\n \\nI see what this county uses tax dollars for, and it's despicable. I'm unwilling, at this point in my life, to trade my moral high ground for a few compliance points. That all being said, it's unfair of me to expect this of most others. I've had an unusually hard life, and it has calloused me to many hardships, one of which is jail. I've been in jail before, and I think it is ironic that the punishment for not paying taxes is that tax payers have to pay for my entire life if I go to jail. That's hilarious to me. \\nMy food? You paid. My medicine? Thanks. At what point do orders become incompatible with your own morals? Genuine question. If you found out tomorrow that your income tax was being used to fund the cruel destruction of children, would you still pay?I think you would, because you've likely partitioned the issue off in your mind, just like a hit man doesn't consider the greater implications of the life he's taken. I wouldn't. If that makes me irrational in your eyes, so be it. The funny part is that you're being robbed, but you invite the thief into your life and then VOTE for which figurehead you wish you'd best prefer to be the one to rob you. I literally cannot think of a more abusive, pathetic, and demoralizing dynamic to be involved in. And then I'm the outlier for my view on it? People like you are why this is the land of the fee, home of the slave. What do you think the threshold percentage of non-payers would have to be before the IRS can't do anything about it? It's not that high. There's 3548 people in the USA per IRS employee. That's every IRS employee in the USA from clerks to field agents to janitors. However, in the entire USA, there's only 2100 field agents as of last year. That equals 157142.85 Americans per field agent. It's a losing battle for them if even a small percentage of people can see it for the house of cards it is and stop being victimized by fear and propaganda.","title":"Hospitals are giving pregnant women drugs, and then reporting them to CPS when they test positive"},{"text":"Be louder.

We have done this, for better or for worse, by making student loans very low risk for lenders. The system, in that narrow viewpoint, is a success. Unfortunately, we didn't take precautions to ensure the price of college didn't run away because it was so easy to secure a loan for it. If we made student loans dischargeable, they'd become riskier for lenders, and fewer people would be able to get them, which would mean fewer people could get a college education.The student loan system needs to be fixed, but I'm not sold that making them dischargeable is the best way to do that.

But then don't make progressives responsible for doing the work associated with the job they don't have.Yes, politics has never not been ruthless and full of conflicting self-interest.  So, why are progressives expected to be any different?  Why can't we be ruthless and full of self-interest like it's accepted that y'all are?  We don't have huge corporate backing and allied mainstream media.  We don't have the power within institutions like the DNC or DCCC in order to weaponize them against our fellow Democrats.  The only methods progressives have to be ruthless and self-interested is by voting for moderates, or not voting.  If y'all want to gatekeep us out of having responsibility within the party, that's your choice, but live with your choice.  Don't make that choice and then go and make us responsible for the party when we're not allowed responsibility within the party.I have never, not once, claimed that progressives have it \\"So figured out.\\"  Progressives DO NOT HAVE IT FIGURED OUT.  I can freely admit that.  Progressives have numerous internal problems, problems that have nothing to do with the establishment or moderates, and if you'd like me to discuss them, I can oblige, (Believe me, I love talking about progressive internal politics and progressive self-owns that have nothing to do with moderates or the establishment), but that is a different conversation.  This conversation is about the relationship between the party and progressives/new blood candidates.The game is rigged and the party is corrupt.  That's just facts.  We just had a Senator accused of bribery who was found hiding literal gold bars in his house.  This was the second time he was hit with serious corruption allegations.  The party didn't shun him after the first time.  In fact, the party helped him immensely against a progressive challenger trying to primary him after the first set of allegations, and the party won.  Congratulations on rewarding corruption.  I guess backing corrupt moderate Senators is all par for the course in the game of ruthless self-interest moderates like to play and are so good at.  The party just installed a ranking member to the Oversight Committee who has allegations of insider trading and graft.  Seriously?  The Oversight Committee?  The irony is so think you can cut it with a knife, but I'm not supposed to complain about that?You do make one good point.  You are correct that it is progressives' job to overcome the corruption, the rigging, the ruthlessness and the self-interest, things that have always existed in politics.  Progressives have failed to overcome those obstacles more than they have succeeded.  That's facts.  We own that.  But then, what is moderates' job in regards to those obstacles?  Is it moderates' job to defend and/or excuse corruption, rigging, ruthlessness and self-interest?  Sure seems like it.  I mean, that's what you're doing now. Is that really what you want to spend your time doing?Moderates spent most of this shortened election cycle trying to appeal to people who like Liz Cheney and John Bolton, all four of them.  That's what they felt gave them their best chance to win.  That was their choice.  It certainly wasn't progressives' choice.  So, why then are progressives responsible for Harris's defeat?  If we're going to blame voters for political defeats (And I don't think we should), isn't the responsibility on the four Liz Cheney and John Bolton supporters to get Harris elected, or even better, the responsibility of the people who forwarded that stupid strategy?  In 2016, Chuck Schumer famously said, \\"For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.\\"  That was the strategy for 2016 (And they repeated that strategy in 2024).  It wasn't our strategy.  We weren't a part of it.  So, if Chuck Schumer and moderate Democrats alienate blue-collar voters as part of their strategy, but don't get two moderate suburban Republican votes for every blue-collar Democrat vote lost, how is that progressives' fault and not Schumer's and moderate Democrats' fault?We're not your bitch. Stop trying to make progressives your bitch.  If moderates want an ally in progressives, moderates need to be an ally to progressives.  If moderates want an enemy in progressives, no changes are necessary.  Moderates have a choice between the two, between ally-ship or enemies and progressives will deal with the results of moderates' decision whichever way they choose.  If you choose to be allies, and back it up with deeds and not just words, we'll be allies, but if the choice is to continue to treat progressives like enemies so that you can suck up to right-wingers, we'll perform our role in that play too.  It's just standard, ruthless self-interested politics, right?","title":"Democrats have learned nothing from their election loss"},{"text":"Yeah, Im just waiting for Moms for Liberty to start their Onlyfans account.","title":"Reading is fun(demental)"},{"text":"Theyre sending Herschel to the Bahamas?","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"the hippies and wreckers are going to lose. the bombthrowing anarchists are going to lose. all of the different flavors of resentful, implacable hunchbrains are going to lose. and then we'll have world peace.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Does XI: Toxic Nationalism/Regionalism encompass advocating for the restoration of the Holy Roman Empire or does that count under imperialism?

Idk, paywall.I'd first say that I've seen conservatives (or at least, the libertarian dude-bros who cannot bring themselves to wonder if they might be liberal) mostly supportive of Mangione. It's been mostly mainstream corporate media pushing negative narratives about him, running against a strong grain on social media support for him.With Penny, the case is nuanced and I'm not exactly misaligned with conservatives, except that I believe they would have bent over backwards defending Penny if he had simply shouted the N-word and attacked the nearest innocent bystander. They're so happy to have a vindicated case to parade around so we can forget about the lynchings they both implicitly and explicitly support (e.g. Ahmaud Arbery, Tamir Rice etc.). For them, it's like some tally game where rights and wrongs need to be quantized to justify their psychopathic ideation of justice. They're happy to have a vindicating token, they don't really care about Penny, his family, or the outcome of the trial (which I think was just). They want the left to be mad about it, and they aren't. But the left also remembers how they react to every instance of this sort. If conservatives want to bend over backwards and betray their faith/traditionalism to justify murder, no one should take them seriously when they balk at a political execution done in the name of a moralized cause. Penny was a rote case of self defense, hence the outcome. But that's a legal distinction, and the moral distinction becomes blurred when one considers the harm done by business big-wigs.Again, I can't read the article, but from the view paragraphs I can see, this does seem to be another case of trying to create a \\"left vs right\\" narrative where generally they are in agreement.

For actual votes, here's what I've found (I've seen different estimates for voting eligible population; none change the overall results too drastically): Total eligible voters (2024 vs. 2020): 244,666,890 vs. 240,628,443 (diff. of 4,038,447) Total POTUS votes (2024 vs. 2020): 156,302,318 vs. 158,429,631 (diff. of -2,127,313) Non-voters (2024 vs. 2020): 88,364,572 vs. 82,198,812 (diff. of 6,165,760)So even overall, only 6.1M more people didn't vote for POTUS.

So, if we instead look at the difference between 2024's non-voters vs. the equivalent amount if it had the same turnout as 2020, by do [NV24 - VEP24*(NV20/VEP20)], we get:89,278,948-244,666,890*(80,899,282/240,628,443) = 4,786,224.22In other words, about 4.7M fewer people voted than if we had the same turnout as 2020- with the 2020 election being the highest turnout in the 20th and 21st centuries.","title":"AOC Snub Shows How Democrats Refuse to Learn Lessons of 2024"},{"text":"Then you need to re-configure your polling system because youre quite obviously wrong.

There are people who want to come and contribute to our great country and bring their skills here to participate here, and then there are people who come here and think they're owed money to send back home, don't learn the language, and don't feel the need to participate in our society as well. My wife used to be a public school teacher in a heavily Hispanic district and it's pretty amazing the dichotomy. There are some that came here and are eternally grateful for the country and the school and put in so much time and effort trying to give their child a life they never had. Then there's another subset that sees welfare as their right, doesn't give a shit about their child other than the welfare benefits they bring, and honestly it's fucking heartbreaking hearing some of the stories.\\nActually one of the most amazing stories, this is a bit off topic but I promise ties everything together, is my wife had a runin with a Hispanic child who was super upset a new black child had joined the class. He yelled \\"we already have too many blacks\\" before physically attacking my wife when she was trying to calm him down and explain it's not ok to racially discriminate, who again is middle eastern and not white. When my wife tried to refer this Hispanic child to the office for something that was clearly learned in the home, the white principal reprimanded my wife, because clearly it was my wife's fault that this child has learned anti-black racism in the home, and she hadn't \\"built a relationship\\" with the racist student. When she reached out to her union rep, another white lady, the response was \\"well we can't punish Hispanic child and enable the school to prison pipeline\\". This is what happens in far left school districts. Brown teachers are punished by white administrators by not solving racism, and the unions teachers pay for take the sides of the woke mob. It's fucking absurd, and thank God my wife got out of there and got a private sector job where she's making double what her salary was as a teacher and has a manager who actually gives a shit about her well being and actual performance over the social justice agenda. It turns out when she's actually judged on how well she does her job instead of how well she conforms to the woke agenda, she's really fucking good at her job. It's actually pretty amazing the progression she's made from thinking Republicans are evil for wanting to get rid of the department of education, to still generally voting Democrat but being 100% for removing the department of education and supporting private and charter schools.","title":"I see this sentiment all the time and it only ever gets funnier.

I feel just like you in so many ways. I'm also a moderate but did vote for Trump. I think that's how bad the situation has gotten on the far left. And I'm with you. I feel the same way about immigrants from Latin America. I know what they're about. I speak their language. I used to work in an immigration law practice and helped them with securing their papers. And while their values may not be so different on paper, it's their general mindset, and disdain for America, Americans and our culture that makes many of them incompatible with our society. It's that disdain that drives their unwillingness to adapt, and they feel really entitled to privileges that are meant to only be for citizens, not just any person who comes across the border. They don't value our citizenship bc they never worked hard for it in the first place. I'm so sick of the narrative that anyone who comes over deserves to be an American, or that they're great people just because they made their way here. A lot of them come here solely to make money, and to take advantage of the benefits. But they have no loyalty to our country, and no respect for us or our culture. They openly talk shit about us while living in our home. I was watching a video earlier today talking about just that. All groups went further right, not just whites, but Latinos, blacks, and Asians all went to the right. And in the case of Latinos, they went the hardest to the right and that's bc who else knows the type of people we're dealing with better than us?It's like you said. These people are so deranged to the rest of us, and I'm happy America, and the world, seems to be waking up finally.

There can be little doubt that Russert had enemies in high places, and they may have feared they would be indicted as war criminals if Russert was not stopped. With Israel's current saber rattling, an Israeli strike against Iran seems eminent, with support from the Bush Administration. When such things are being planned, the plotters must get their propaganda machinery in place prior to the attack. This could be another reason for Mr. Russert's sudden demise.**Background: It's easy to forget that Russert had been pulled in the middle of the controversial debate about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq when he testified in the trial of Scooter Libby approximately 16 months ago. Mr. Russert was called to testify by Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald, and his testimony on February 7, 2007 ultimately helped convict Irv Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby on four counts of perjury related to White House harassment of former diplomat Joe Wilson for criticizing President Bush's statements about Saddam Hussein's efforts to obtain weapons of massive destruction. In apparent retaliation for Wilson's criticism, the Bush administration leaked to the press that Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame, was a covert CIA agent/operative. The reason for leaking this information was to plant terror in the minds of Wilson and his wife. On June 1, 2008, twelve days before Mr. Russerts sudden death, Russert interviewed former Bush press secretary Scott McClellan on Meet the Press. McClellan had recently created a firestorm with revelations revealed in his new book,?What Happened(?) -? Inside the Bush White House and Washington's Culture of Deception. In the interview, McClellan indicated that Bush's former top political aide, Karl Rove, also lied to him about personal involvement in the Wilson/Plame harassment case. Twelve days later, on June 13, 2008, Russert was dead. Scooter Libby was Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States, Dick Cheney, and Assistant to the Vice President for National Security Affairs.*(more details at [**source**](http://web.archive.org/web/20080823054644/http://surftofind.com/mystery))","title":"Tim Russert, the beloved host of NBC's \\"Meet the Press,\\" met a suspicious end in June 2008, when he suddenly collapsed from what was officially reported as a heart attack."},{"text":"Democrats and personal enrichment? \\nIM ASTOUNDED.

That is no small undertaking, and would be more expensive than what we currently have, since you would have state and federal elections managed separately.Perhaps, thats what we need anyway. But Id wait for such a system to be put in place and proven trustworthy before even thinking of switching to popular vote mechanics.As it currently stands, red states right now have some of the strongest voter ID requirements. But states like California are the exact opposite. In California, it is actually illegal to even check someones ID when they vote. And everyone in CA is mailed a ballot regardless of if they requested one.NOTE  I am not saying widespread voter fraud currently happens in California. I am saying that if you did want to cheat in a popular vote election, CA would be one of the best states to do it in. Large population, purposely laxed rules.With the Electoral College system we dont have to worry about that. California can use whatever shady election system it wants, and the electoral votes it has available are still capped, limiting the damage of those shady practices.NOTE  I am also not saying I believe that cheating occurred on a large scale in 2020. I know thats controversial for good reason. But I do think theoretical concerns were raised that havent been properly addressed.A popular vote election is only going to grow the seeds of doubt about cheating, which is not healthy for our democracy.","title":"In effort to \\"restore democracy,\\" Democrats introduce bill to abolish the Electoral College"},{"text":"The DNC is the first hurdle in our quest to progress.

He built his own business from the ground up, and has built an amazing life here. They enjoy food from their culture, but they love celebrating Thanksgiving and were super excited to learn and participate in the holiday. In short they're the type of immigrants I want coming to this country. We don't ask that you leave all your traditions at home, we merely ask that you try to integrate into American society while bringing the best of what your culture has to offer as well. But apparently I hate brown people because of stuff like that.\\nOh also speaking of Trump supporters, my father in law is a huge Trump supporter. Again he knows I'm not and loves me anyway because I love and take care of his daughter and as he's getting older I'm always willing to go out of my way to help him with anything he needs.

Like sweeping every swing state and every D+15 state or less from 2020. Its worth noting that Harris *won* independents despite losing nationwide, and received more crossover votes than Trump did. Democrats were not motivated to vote, and voters trusted Republicans more on the economy (the number 1 issue). That is not a recipe for Democratic success, yet they only lost the popular vote by 1.5, and every swing state but Arizona was decided under 3 points. Democrats arguably shouldve lost in a 40-state landslide regardless of who they ran if it was not for Trump being such a repugnant political figure.

They've been threatening to do this out in the open. And this agenda is already underway. A potent combination of a unitary executive, broad immunities for the president, executive actions like schedule F, and a MAGA coalition of loyalists that will consolidate power by exploiting Trump's ego to take control of the administrative state and pave the way for a future one party system of government with King Trump at its head.And almost every Trump appointee so far has been picked to help implement this agenda, each one representing a transaction. \\"What have you done for me, and what will you do for me in exchange for this position?\\" They've exchanged their loyalty for a spot within his administration where they can do the most damage.This is what we've been warned about, at least those of us who didn't just vote a demagogue back into office because...  *feelings*. This is the future that political junkies and analysts have been calling a \\"crisis of incompetence.\\"Schedule F is an executive action that the Trump administration tried implementing towards the end of his previous term, It's also a major policy proposal included in Project 2025. It attempts to strip protections from civil servants whose government positions will depend largely on their allegiance to the president and his agenda. Schedule F, combined with a unitary executive and broad immunities granted to the president, will afford Republicans the power to cripple the system of checks and balances holding our democracy together, helping them to consolidate power for the foreseeable future.Project 2025 laid it all out in their manifesto, while heritage foundation members and \\"America first\\" Trump allies have been preparing for this eventuality. People who have already been appointed to positions of power within Trump's new admin.The Unitary executive Theory is another major goal of project 2025, and a proposal that's been floated before by Republicans. Bill Barr was a major proponent, and it's part of the reason why he shot down the Mueller investigations efforts to hold Trump accountable for obstruction. The UET proposes that the president has unchecked powers and complete control over the executive branch.The goal is to eliminate the independence of most government agencies and put them under the direct control of the executive, crippling the separation of powers in the process and giving Trump unilateral authority over the administrative state. These actions will allow The Trump administration to then install loyalists into positions of power within these agencies, and positions that were formerly reserved for non-partisan civil servants, knowledgeable staff and experts in their field, whose job security didn't previously depend on their loyalty to the president. And come next year, Republicans will have the best opportunity they've had in years to see this agenda through because they'll have a Trump administration with unchecked powers, a Republican majority in both houses, and a conservative SCOTUS.It might seem a little confusing because part of their goal is to \\"gut the administrative state,\\" which is also sometimes called the fourth branch of government, and includes every government agency you can think of that's responsible for running and regulating day to day operations in this country.However, the other part involves taking what's left, dismantling our democratic system of checks and balances, and creating a government that serves the Republican party, consolidates power for itself and installs Trump as king and useful idiot in chief.Hence, a \\"crisis of incompetence.\\"The next Trump administration is also preparing to create new agencies out of thin air, offering people like Elon Musk a top role in these agencies.From this standpoint, they'll have the perfect opportunity to implement an authoritarian, far right agenda backed by special/rich interests, right wing think tanks, dark money groups, Christian nationalists, far right jingoists, corporate powers with the same rights as American citizens, foreign autocrats, right wing power brokers, billionaires, xenophobes, conspiracy theorists, and in some cases, white supremacists...This is an agenda that will also pave the way for future Republican administrations to continue building a one party system of government, while setting up roadblocks for any progressive, or even populist efforts or movements that may take hold in the future. Because make no mistake, this ain't populism, it more closely resembles an age of modern day robber barons working closely with politicians, or vice versa. Hell, in some cases, they're basically synonymous.Laurence W. Britt, who published *\\"Fascism Anyone?\\"*, made a list of 14 defining characteristics of fascism. This list has become widely shared and circulated.

The weaponization has already begun, and as usual projection from the Republican Party. At least there were receipts for the Trump investigations, just the cowards who claim to care for the country end up bending over backwards to protect him.

Aubrey', who says the line, is a textbook example of the stern, but fair leader. This character respects each of the men under his command as a human being. He also understands that discipline is key to any sort of complex human undertaking, the sailing of a ship of war in this case. At one point in the film, one of the sailors fails to salute an unpopular officer who the men perceive as cursed or unlucky, or as they put it, a \\"Jonah\\", as well as cowardly.Cpt. Aubrey has the man flogged, which was British custom, as well as law, at the time. His close friend, a naturalist, surgeon of the ship, and the closest thing 1805 had to a classical liberal, protests, in private, on grounds of morality. He claims the man was drunk on the issued ration of rum, that it was a minor offense, and that flogging is an outdated, barbaric technique. I'm paraphrasing of course. Aubrey responds \\"Men must be governed. Often not well I grant you, but they must be governed\\" (if this isn't 100% accurate I apologize but it's close and captures the idea)This is essentially an argument of leniency against discipline, military discipline in this case. At its core, it's really an argument about the governing body's right to impose order on the individual. On one hand, you have empathy, understanding, and respect for the sanctity of the self. On the other, you have acknowledgment of the cold reality that, without stern law and order, and therfore punishment, no enterprise can succeed, at least not for long. Humans cannot function as a group in any meaningful way without hierarchy. It's not a man made idea, but an unwavering law of the natural world. Every religion has its God, every company its CEO, every ship its captain, every tribe its cheif, every wolf pack its alpha. When left to their own devices, all social structures shake out like this, with few if any exceptions. Man or beast, down to the ants.In the animal kingdom, this law is acted out primarily via instinct, which isn't surprising considering the absence of conscience thought. However, with higher complexity, there comes higher amounts of conflict and therein discipline. In humans, it forms naturally, but it will fail if it isn't upheld with discipline at every level. The alternative is chaotic anarchy, which I simply refuse to acknowledge as a legitimate philosophy. Men must be governed. The alternative is a cruel bloodbath, ruled not by highly evolved, endlessly debated philosophical ideals born of our greatest minds, but by the physical power of the strong. In the absence of the rule of law, those most capable of violence will always rise to the top of the very gory, very bloodstained pile.Men must be governed. To think anything else is childish, and naive.","title":"CMV: The Republican Party needs to dissolve and be replaced by a libertarian party"},{"text":"If Vance were to become President, he would be in charge of the most powerful country which has ever existed in the history of human civilization... and Elon Musk has a *big* mouth.i.e. Vance, I suspect, won't wait for Elon to \\"steamroll\\" anything lol","title":"US funding plan collapses as Trump makes demands days before shutdown"},{"text":"Time to retire this old horse.","title":"How Nancy Pelosi Would Be Impacted by Congressional Stock Trading Ban"},{"text":"We have a fascist moving into the White House.

I actually do believe that you don't need to take shrooms, but they can help perhaps. So you've seen them as insects, can you describe them more? And it's good you calmed yourself down with the Bible and Jesus, but as good and exemplary Jesus is, I don't know if it's the truth. Icke basically had the idea that the reincarnation trap of the moon, deceives you into believing Jesus is taking you to heaven, therefore Religion no matter which one can practically work in favor of these parasites. Also, how does it feel when you get your energy noticeably drained by them?","title":"Let's be realistic for a moment.

Having read the agreement, there seems to be reporting requirements because naturally ukraine has always been under the thumb of russia and corrupt in it's own right so I have to assume there was skepticism inherent to the US policy makers that led to these requirements. You asked a good question, what research is being done, although i thought it's odd that you assume that all of this is secretive when i found it quite easily by researching what the agreement was called and then looking for information relating to it's impact.   Under an August 2005?Cooperative Threat Reduction?agreement, the?[United States](https://www.nti.org/countries/united-states/)?has been funding security upgrades at Ukrainian biological institutes where dangerous pathogens are kept.?[^(12)]()?In June 2010, a new disease research laboratory named the Interim Central Reference Laboratory opened in Odessa as part of the U.S. Cooperative Threat Reduction program. The laboratory studies biological agents such as?tularemia,?anthrax?and Q-fever.?[^(13)]()?The U.S. Government has upgraded nine Ministry of Health and Veterinary labs in Ukraine since 2013.?[^(14)]()[source for this quote](https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/ukraine-overview/)if you're looking for specific publications stemming from this work i think this is a good diving board to find that relatively easily. This also clarifies what Nuland meant in her comments quite clearly. I assume you are referring to:\\"Ukraine has biological research facilities. We are concerned that Russian forces may try to take them under their control, so we are working with the Ukrainians to prevent any of these research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces.\\"The research material includes samples of dangerous pathogens. One of the goal of the agreement was to transition the labs from developing bioweapons to protecting people from them, which naturally requires access to the pathogens themselves. Keep in mind that having samples of pathogens is not enough to create a bioweapon, kind of analogous to the differences between uranium processing for energy or military applications. You would need large scale fermentation systems and technology for dispersal, neither of which are relevant to a research facility.I think all of this quite satisfyingly answers your questions, shows a positive relationship between ukraine and the US leading to beneficial outcomes.

Putin had to work within the Russian in order to turn it into what it is now and that took a long time from like 2000 to 2011. It's the same in Turkey. And in our case because of the constitution and the rules that the founding fathers put in to make sure how hard it was to change our constitution, Trump and Maga have a lot of hopes they would need to jump through in order to get it done.

The more people you get into the tent the higher the chance you win. You need to get both libs and leftist in the tent to win, because conservatives can beat them if they are by themselves. Dem leadership's strategy of targeting the centrist median to try and steal center right voters fails to actually understand the conditions of Median Voter Theory during a chaotic period (hint: voters on both sides can move further from the center) nor the fact that people have bias and don't always vote for whats in their best interest. It only worked for Clinton in the 90s, because conditions were more stable and voters still held \\"Democrats are for the workers\\" bias. If you move the tent too far to the right, people on the left might view you as not that much different from the right or the \\"manufactured opposition\\". And so you lose 4M voters and wonder why the center right didn't come and fill that void. You have to energize voters to come out for you with things they wants. Obama's ACA tapped into that, combined with a left leaning rhetoric in 2008, got a huge turn out from the left.

Ultimately if we only had two parties and it was the libertarians and the democrats, I think the same kind of patterns would emerge. In general I am much more sympathetic to the libertarians than any other political party, pretty much because they are the only party without blood on their hands, and because \\"please leave me alone\\" should not be a threatening ideology to anyone. However, it stands to reason that if you needed to have a certain level of pushback in the United States government to keep things from getting out of control in one direction or another. To be specific, I agree that the United States cannot continue to fund broken social programs indefinitely, however, a lot of the Libertarians would support ripping the bandaid off while it might be best in reality to take a more gradual approach. I agree with the Libertarians that inserting ourselves and our tax dollars into every foreign conflict possible is in general a very bad thing, it would be reckless to just unwind everything immediately and dismantle our global defenses. With greater choice comes greater compromise, and I think the United States deserves a political system that is more then just the two party non-sense it has now.","title":"CMV: The Republican Party needs to dissolve and be replaced by a libertarian party"},{"text":"Even most people in Scranton are pissed about this.","title":"Shapiro blasts Bidens commutation of sentence for former Pa. judge: Some children took their lives because of this"},{"text":"The sooner dems start playing the same way republicans do, the sooner this game will move forward.

[**Psychology Today has one too**](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/political-minds/202008/three-popular-myths-about-transgender-youth), and  [**here**](http://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf) are the guidelines from the AAP. TL;DR version - yes, young children can identify their own gender, and some of those young kids are trans. A child who is Gender A but who is assumed to be Gender B based on their visible anatomy at birth can suffer debilitating distress over this conflict. The *\\"90% desist\\"* claim is a myth based on debunked studies, and transition is a very long, slow, cautious process for trans youth.According to the [**American Academy of Pediatrics**](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx), gender is typically expressed by around age 4. It probably forms [**much earlier**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747736/), but it's hard to tell with pre-verbal infants. And sometimes the gender expressed is not the one typically associated with the child's appearance. The genders of trans children are as [**stable**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) as those of [**cisgender children**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614568156).For preadolescents transition is entirely social, and for adolescents the first line of medical care is temporary, reversible puberty delaying treatment that has no long term effects. Hormone therapy isn't an option until their mid teens, by which point the chances that they will \\"desist\\" are close to zero. Reconstructive genital surgery is not an option until their late teens/early 20's at the youngest.And transition-related medical care is recognized as medically necessary, frequently life saving medical care by every major medical authority. ---\\n**#1:*Citations on transition as medically necessary, frequently life saving medical care, and the only effective treatment for gender dysphoria, as recognized by every major medical authority: Here is a resolution from the [**American Psychological Association**](https://www.apa.org/about/policy/resolution-gender-identity.pdf); *\\"THEREFORE  BE  IT  FURTHER  RESOLVED  that  APA  recognizes  the efficacy, benefit and medical necessity of gender transition treatments for appropriately evaluated individuals and calls upon public  and  private  insurers  to  cover  these  medically  necessary  treatments.\\"* More from the APA [**here**](http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/programs/transgender/?tab=1)* Here is an [**AMA resolution**](http://www.tgender.net/taw/ama_resolutions.pdf) on the efficacy and necessity of transition as appropriate treatment for gender dysphoria, and call for an end to insurance companies categorically excluding transition-related care from coverage* A policy statement from the [**American College of Physicians**](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M14-2482)* [**Here**](https://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf) are the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines* [**Here**](https://www.aafp.org/dam/AAFP/documents/events/alf_ncsc/Education.pdf) is a resolution from the American Academy of Family Physicians* [**Here**](https://www.socialworkers.org/assets/secured/documents/da/da2008/reffered/Transgender.pdf) is one from the National Association of Social Workers","title":"List of Democrats Who Voted for Defense Act With Ban on Transgender Care"},{"text":"And Trump won without getting a majority of the popular vote.","title":"AOC Snub Shows How Democrats Refuse to Learn Lessons of 2024"},{"text":"He wasnt president when he should down the GOP backed immigration bill too.

It's exhausting!The \\"short\\" version of it is this:Trump won all the swing states, yet in those same swing states Democrats won down ballot. Not just a little, by a lot. In North Carolina they won every single important race except the presidency.So, those are facts. Do you know how often a down-ballot candidate, in particular a *senate* candidate, wins when their presidential candidate loses? Hardly ever. It happened maybe 3-4 times TOTAL between the late 70s early 80s and now. Do you know how many times it happened in 2024? 5 times.Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada *all* went to Democratic senate candidates, while Bob Casey lost Pennsylvania by a hair. Meanwhile, those same voters picked Trump to be the president.In each of those presidential races there was a \\"drop-off\\" effect (which you may have heard incorrectly described as \\"bullet ballots\\") in which people voted for a presidential candidate but made no other choices. This does happen in elections, but it's always a fraction of a percent. In 2024, the drop off numbers are staggering and always beyond the margin of victory. [This article](https://smartelections.substack.com/i/152549741/number-of-votes-involved-is-larger-than-margin-of-victory) has those graphs and data sets if you're interested.Could this all be a coincidence? Sure. It's entirely possible. In the same way that an NBA game could mathematically end in a shut out. Or you could play 5-card poker with one draw and be dealt a royal flush. Except that the odds of being dealt a royal flush are 1 in 650k, so you'd actually need to be dealt 5.5 royal flushes consecutively to have the same odds as this election (one data analyst claimed the odds of Trump winning all the swing states while losing those senate seats was 1 in 35 billion).","title":"CMV: Republicans making fun of democrats reaction to the election are giant hypocrites."},{"text":"I'm betting that if the government shuts down between now and 2026, he'll blame Biden, and his people will believe him fully.

Keep debating these grand ideas while the other side chips away at policy after policy (whichever side of the aisle you might be) .....These debates, especially from this publication and similar, tend to compare Democracy with other systems of government. They disregard the 5 key precepts: ONE. Democracy is a concept and it's on a spectrum not a monolith e.g. Democracy in India is not the same as Democracy in the U.S.\\nSame for other systems of government e.g. autocracy in Singapore is not the same as autocracy in Saudi \\nTWO. The mere act of 'voting' ain't Democracy. In practise you need to have established  processes for Transparency and Accountability with reproach.\\nCase in point: an average New Yorker has to vote for 9 elected officials (1 presidential + 2 congressional + 1 gubernatorial + 3 state legislature + 1 mayoral + 1 city council). Can an average New Yorker be expected to know all the insides and outs of where the buck stops and on what? \\nTHREE. Democracy without engagement is not Democracy: what was the voter turn-out in the last 4 elections?  No more than 60% at best. \\nFOUR. Framework of Democracy is key: Democracy executed through an overly complicated framework is likely to lose citizen engagement (think Electoral college, first past the post, riding system in Canada)\\nFIVE. Any system of government without a feedback mechanism is likely to be ineffective: is there a mechanism for citizens to provide periodic feedback with consequences e.g.. annual, biannual, etc. \\nTheoretically electing public representatives is still the most fair way of governance (Note I am not using the term Democracy). One anchor that can be applied to improve governance is introducing independence into Fiscal Policy (how governments spend tax dollars). Note: most western 'Democracies' have a framework for independent 'Monetary policy'Fiscal policy Independence is essentially democratization of taxation. In order words citizens choose how their money will be spent (e.g. annually, biannually, etc.). This can potentially address most if not all of the points above.

The second amendment prevents that too and how would that have stopped these school shootings? Do you know what the gun show loop hole is? Basically that unless a state has other laws, several do like NJ, you can sell a rifle or a shotgun face to face between private parties like we can with any other property you own as a civilian. Handguns cannot be sold this way and gun shops cannot sell this way even at a gun show. The so called loop hole wouldn't change anything but prevent me from selling a friend a hunting rifle if he needs one without taking it a licensed gun store to do the transfer like I currently have to do with handguns. The only thing it does is cost me 75 dollars to do so. A ban on that practice wouldn't do anything for gun violence but would effect a lot of innocent gun owners so what's the point? As a layman you should really take the time to learn more about what gun laws there are before trying to justify more laws. Most guns are sold requiring a back ground check through a FFL even in a 2A friendly state like mine. Ultimately common sense gun laws only make it more expensive for those that need guns to protect themselves and their community while doing nothing to actually stop gun violence. As for gun violence in this country, most of it, 56 percent in fact is suicide since that's added to the number, also added to that number are cops shooting people, self defense shootings justified or not regardless of if charges are pressed, and accidental deaths by firearms. When you consider all that the actual number of violent deaths by firearm while still greater then Europe is much more in line with them. Basically we don't have an extraordinary gun violence problem in the US, just that it gets a lot of attention since it's a hot button issue like LGBTQA folks and immigration. Hell look how fired up they got you all about trans peeps and we're less then 2 percent of the population lol.","title":"Demand Gun Reform..."},{"text":"I'm not american, if that wasn't obvious,? just trying to draw from a number of sources.

And when he predictably lost the first 5 primaries, things actually looked promising. Until the COVID pandemic effectively cancelled the campaign, and the corporate media pretended the actual frontrunner didn't exist.

Joe can't do the job again and everybody knows it, but he doesn't bother to drop out of the campaign until July, so they throw in the candidate who literally had to drop out of the race BEFORE a single vote was cast in the 2020 race, because polling showed she was losing her own state.

And the modern so-called democracies are all good examples of practical solutions to this problem, even though they were not consciously designed with this problem in mind.\\"[https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/01/31/from-the-archives-the-open-society-and-its-enemies-revisited](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/01/31/from-the-archives-the-open-society-and-its-enemies-revisited)","title":"Does Democracy Even Work?"},{"text":"https://kamalaharris.com/issues/Assault weapons bans.","title":"This Parkland Shooting Survivor Wants a Top DNC Leadership Spot - We need to realize that we are increasingly the party of sycophants, David Hogg warned, stressing the need for a shift in the Democratic Party."},{"text":"We all have.","title":"Close to getting another Reddit suspension"},{"text":"Maybe, when someone mildly suggests Dems move to the center, not implying theyre racist would be a good start to appealing to more voters.","title":"Democratic Donors Will Gather to Plot Ways Forward Under Trump"},{"text":"Need to abandon the idea that if people are just presented the facts or right argument then theyll change their minds.

God, anybody that disagrees with this usually hasn't read the Bible enough. I used to think the same until I truly read the Bible all the way through with the Holy Spirit, guiding my interpretation of it, and it is actually very clear. God is both loving and judging, and the book of the Bible that is the most judgemental is clearly Revelation as well. Also although Love you Neighbor as you love yourself wasn't one of the 10 commandments but it was a verse in the Old Testament Levitcus 19:18 \\"You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against any of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD\\" why the the people of Jewish faith needed laws that Christians don't have to follow is for this reason. The Isrealites were very materialistic people and did not understand. Heavenly things they could barely grasp the earthly and material things.  Also, the laws weren't only to make the people better/more moral it was also to distinguish them from other people and other tribes. Also, as a Christian, and like early Christians, I do follow the Sabbath. The thing is, you are getting confused about the letter of the law and the heart of the law. What Jesus truly wanted Christians to do was love the neighbor as you love yourself and your enemies, help the poor and those in need, love God with all thy heart, not say anything that defiled you and to praise God. If one did all those things and has faith in Jesus the Son of God, and the Word of God in flesh who died on the Cross and sacrificed himself to conquer sin and death, then they are spiritually pure. Those who followed the law when they broke one law broke them all, and nobody was perfect enough to perfectly follow the law, and the law only existed to set up Jesus anyway. So you would faith in Jesus, and by doing so, you would not have to follow the law because through Jesus's sacrifice and your faith in him you are already perfected and born again in Spirit as prophecies in Isaiah.","title":"I used to be trained master mystic/magician, but around 6 months ago I converted to Christianity and now I am devout Christian.

I disagree. I'm not sure how any one can read the Old testament and the New testament and come to the conclusion that they are about the same God. Jesus quotes the Old testament, but only when it lines up with his view. Otherwise the majority of the gospels are him contradicting it. And the passages people bring up in defence of them being the same are all quite weak. For example \\"Think not that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.\\" Matthew 5:15Yet just a few passages down he goes on to in no uncertain terms abolish a law from the Old testament. \\"You have heard that it was said, Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth. But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well. \\" Matthew 5:38-40Clearly Jesus doesn't view everything written in the Old testament as being the actual laws of the prophets. Which is something that every Christian and Jew should believe since the Old testament says so it's self. \\"How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of Jehovah is with us? But, behold, the false pen of the scribes hath wrought falsely.\\" Jeremiah 8:8People might say he meant the important ones like the 10 commandments. But tell me. Which commandment was \\"Love your neighbor as you love yourself?\\" At which point did he tell his followers to obey the Sabbath or to not make false idols? Why did he tell us that the greatest commandment is to love God when the first commandment was to worship it? Why is the second greatest commandment in Jesus's eyes a commandment that the God of the OT never included?","title":"I used to be trained master mystic/magician, but around 6 months ago I converted to Christianity and now I am devout Christian.

He said it because it was Biden's economy, not because he cared.
