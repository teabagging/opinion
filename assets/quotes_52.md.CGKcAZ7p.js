They have the answer that makes all things coherent in one word: aliens. They're brains just shut off immediately if you try and explain anything more complicated than that, whaaaa you believe those lies they tell us? They scoff, as if they were being the most skeptical and reasonable position in the world. They fool themselves into thinking they have vastly more knowledge than they in fact do by convincing themselves that banal matters they don't have the knowledge to fully understand, are in fact deeply surprising. Because the brain interprets surprising messages as containing more informative value than less surprising ones, they've convinced themselves that they have vastly valuable information. Meanwhile my continuous lack of surprise at every brilliant point they regurgitate to me is just because I don't see it apparently! It can't be that due to all that boring, unsurprising information I've read, those lame, boring lies the evil scientists tell you, I can find obvious contradictions that are not apparent to them. I try to tell them these contradictions of course and they do not understand the point of even what I am doing, oooohhhh that's boring it's not cool like on ancient aliens where you can't see them unless they want to or other common fables since before the beginning of time.

Theres always ulterior motives when it comes to the things republicans say and do, and that motive is almost always money. The politicians and their owners dont actually care about baby murder or whatever else they call abortion for propaganda purposes. They know that the most valuable resource of all is human beings. If theres a sharp population decline, fewer workplace competition means they actually have to compensate competitively rather than let the poors fight each other for starvation wages. It also means less desperate people, which means less criminals to use for sweet, sweet slave labor and also less people willing to risk death and dismemberment in the military for a leg up or a way out of poverty. And at the end of the day, it also means less consumers available to buy all their crap. Less demand for housing after corporate entities have spent years gobbling up housing to jack rent up. Less everything.These shareholders and oligarchs see younger generations becoming disillusioned with the late capitalist hellscape theyve cultivated over the past 40 years and theyre scared shitless. Lots of people are opting to not have children and that number increases with each generation as life gets worse and worse. Theyre eyeing places like Japan nervously. Theyre combatting this by appealing to religious nuts- oldest trick in the book of controlling the masses. They know all they have to do is say Jesus wants you to do X and millions of useful idiots will vote to remove whatever liberty they want them to, right up to the sovereignty of their own flesh.They know the quickest way to level the playing field between the ruling class and the working class is to lessen competition and therefore demand. This is exactly why the renaissance replaced feudalism shortly after the Black Death- which was great for everybody *except* the feudal lords who went from being gods of their little worlds and everyone in them to having to grow their own wheat like everyone else. Well guess what, neo-feudalism is here and our new masters will have to be dragged from their castles kicking and screaming.","title":"The Biden overtime rule was struck down. Now, some workers are losing pay raises"},{"text":"Elizondo seems like either a grifter or a useful idiot to me. He makes too big a deal out of evidence that is too easily debunked by people with a fraction of his resources, he's either legendarily incompetent at his job (investigating UAP's) or purposefully ignores the flaws in his evidence in order to push a narrative that keeps him in well-paid positions.What turned me against the whole \\"we need a government commission to investigate this modern 'UAP' evidence\\" movement are Mick West's videos debunking these modern videos. His GIMBAL, GO-FAST, and \\"Tic-Tac\\" videos are all-timers, but the one that actually impacted me the most was [this video](https://youtu.be/pbxtTEWczRk?si=97iiWyidfYRpcoKM) debunking footage from a Navy ship showing unidentified pyramid-shaped flying objects. The deputy director of Naval Intelligence is in front of Congress telling them that their UFO commission has studied this video for years and determined that the video shows unidentified drones hovering over a Navy exercise... and a random dude on the internet can prove in 10 minutes that those \\"drones\\" are just stars.What is the point of these government run UFO commissions if it's clear that they're not actually investigating anything? It seems to me that these programs (such as UAPTF) are just a way for UFO grifters to launder their \\"evidence\\" through official sources so that the average person thinks that the government is endorsing it. How else does that \\"pyramid\\" video get through to Congress without professional UFO researchers realizing that those lights are just stars?EDIT: To put a finer point on calling these people \\"grifters\\", I want to mention that the original AATIP program was started by Harry Reid on the advice of his friend Robert Bigelow, founder of Bigelow Aerospace and at the time the owner of Skinwalker Ranch (somewhat of a Mecca for UFO sightings and general conspiracy theory bullshit). AATIP was allocated $22 million to study UFO's for 5 years, and what Nevada-based small aerospace company do you think won the contract for all of that $22m?https://thedebrief.org/defense-intelligence-agency-paid-22-million-to-chase-ufos-and-werewolves/Reid told The Debrief that Bigelow Aerospace applied for the $22 million contract and won because the company had facilities that met the requirements for the project. When asked if Bigelow had been pre-selected for the contract due to his connection to Reid, as well as his preexisting public interest in UFOs, Mr. Reid stated flatly, No. It was like any other government contract.Among other tasks, [Bigelow Aerospace] sent its investigators to Utah to investigate sightings of strange phenomena at the infamous Skinwalker Ranch and in the greater Uinta Basin that surrounds it. Skinwalker Ranch is currently owned by real estate mogul Brandon Fugal; prior to his purchase of the property in 2016, the 512-acre ranch was owned by Robert Bigelow himself.It is unclear if Bigelow was in fact attempting to glean information from UFOs on breakthrough technology applications employed in future aerospace weapon systems, as per the DIA mandate for the AAWSAP program. What is clear is that his team was also chasing werewolves and goblins at the same time.Documents examined by The Debrief show that [Bigelow Aerospace] investigators interviewed multiple witnesses in Utahs Uinta Basin who had claimed to see a dog-like creature that allegedly stood on two legs, was over 6 feet tall, and smelled of sulfur. In another document, those same witnesses reported sightings of little people that resembled goblins, standing roughly three to four feet tall and with arms that hang down to the ground. A third report discusses a ghostly human figure standing on a mesa overlooking Skinwalker Ranch.","title":"The New Jersey Drones, UAP Hearings, and a UFO Religion for the 21st Century"},{"text":"It's insane that people still treat this guy like a genius because one time he pointed out the extremely obvious fact that presidential elections are about the economy.","title":"Carville calls Biden most tragic figure in modern American politics"},{"text":"A big thank you to those who voted for Republicans who then put judges in place who strike down so many laws that would help middle class citizens.A big F U to you uninformed voters who never consider what Republicans have done to our rights.

The original constitutional convention in 1787 was convened to address amendments to the articles of confederation that were necessary in light of Shay's rebellion.   The Congress of the articles of Confederation only endorsed the convention on the specific terms \\"\\"for the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation,\\" and specified that the Constitutional Convention would produce a report upon which the Confederation Congress could take up necessary amendments to the articles of confederation.  So what happened the first day of this new convention? On May 25, a quorum of seven states was secured.  They unanimously elected George Washington to be the presiding officer, then they adopted rules providing that each state delegation received a single vote which was to be cast based on the majority opinion of that state's delegates present. If the state's delegates were equally divided, that state would not cast a vote.  They agreed that the convention would remain secret until the conclusion of the meeting.   Very early on, on May 29, the Virginia plan and the South Carolina plan were presented which entirely dispensed with the articles of Confederation, and on May 30, a majority of the convention expressly voted to adopt a new  national government that would have three branches, entirely dispensing with the articles of confederation.   At the conclusion of the convention, a signed constitution was produced which was self-executing to some degree. *The convention resolved \\"unanimously\\" to ignore the Confederation congress and transmit the document directly to state legislatures for ratification, and it would become effective upon the ratification of 9/13 states.*  So transplant this into a modern context? what could it look like if it were captured by a political party? 34 states call for a constitutional convention.  Maybe some previously called, maybe some new ones call.  Maybe there are conditions attached, maybe not, because it may not matter.   27 State Legislatures are currently *exclusively* controlled by the republican party, with 17 democratic states having exclusive control, and 5 divided.   A convention begins,  the convention immediately votes to adopt rules of procedure requiring that each state delegation gets one vote, and a majority of states will control.  Republicans now control 28/50 potential votes in the convention.   Then along a series of party line votes 28-22, 29-21 or 30-20,  Republicans repeatedly drastically re-write the constitution, and get to specify the terms under which the results of this convention are adopted by the States.","title":"A Constitutional Convention?

That was a cataclysm, the Connecticut Democrat wrote on X. Electoral map wipeout.  The Democratic Party had lost touch with far too many American voters, Murphy concluded: We are beyond small fixes.  It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them, Senator Bernie Sanders wrote in a statement issued less than 24 hours after the polls closed.?At the time of those reactions, millions of votes had yet to be counted, and several of the nations closest House races remained uncalled. Now a clearer picture of the election has emerged, complicating the debate over whether Democrats need to reinvent themselvesand whether voters really abandoned them at all.Trumps popular-vote margin has shrunk to about 1.5 percentone of the tightest in the past half centuryand because some votes went to third-party and independent candidates, hell fall just short of winning a majority of the vote nationwide. Compared with incumbent governments elsewhere in the world, Democrats losses were modest. And in the House, they gained a seat, leaving the GOP with the second-smallest majority in history. A trio of Republican vacancies expected early next year will make passing Trumps agenda even more difficult, and Democrats are in a strong position to recapture the chamber in the midterm elections, when the incumbent party typically struggles.The final results are prompting some in the party to push back against the doom-and-gloom diagnoses of Murphy, Sanders, and others who say the Democratic brand is in tatters and needs an overhaul. If the Democratic brand was fundamentally broken and needed to be thrown out, this election would have been a complete blowout. And it was not. It was way too close, Yasmin Radjy, the executive director of Swing Left, a Democratic organizing group, told me. Another Democrat, who requested anonymity in order to speak candidly, put it this way: We lost an election.

Ex 1: A lot of them have a family history of escaping dictatorships that were killing their own people. They do not believe the government should ever have a monopoly of force with which to use against their citizens.Ex 2: confidence in police has dropped significantly. People either dont believe they will come to their aid of even help when they get there. Many feel the need to take their defense into their own hand since the systems in place seem inadequate to do so.Gun control policies have recently taken the form of turning law abiding citizens into post-facto felons with the sweep of a pen. Most are nothing but feel good legislation while others accidentally ban every firearm make before 1918. While many republican policies are on the absolute stupidest hills to die on, people dont forget when Dem state governments turn them into criminals with poorly thought out laws. Andrew Cuomos comments regarding pushback to his NYSAFE Act are a good example or ensuring nobody switches sides.

The option has never been used, but most states have long-forgotten requests on the books that could be enough to trigger a new constitutional convention, some scholars and politicians believe.Some Democratic officials are more concerned than ever. In California, a Democratic state senator, Scott Wiener, will introduce legislation on Monday that would rescind the states seven active calls for a constitutional convention, the first such move since Donald J. Trumps election to a second term....Since 2016, the year Mr. Trump was elected president the first time, nine states that had Democratic-controlled legislatures have been concerned enough that they rescinded their decades-old requests for constitutional amendments, sometimes with support from their fellow Republican legislators. They feared that they were leaving open the door for a Republican-led Congress and state legislatures to pursue a conservative revision of the laws underpinning national governance.The founding fathers set almost no rules governing how such a constitutional convention would work. Article V of the Constitution says that the document can be amended if legislatures in two-thirds of states  now 34 out of 50  agree to convene for the purpose. But it does not set guidelines for how the gathering would function. If the convention produces a proposed amendment, the change would still need to be ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures....The founding document does not say whether 34 states need to agree on the specific amendment topic or whether signaling that they want a convention for any reason is enough to trigger proceedings. There is no explanation of whether each state at the convention would get one vote or more, whether topics not on the agenda can be raised, whether lobbyists or special interest groups could participate, or who would referee disagreements. Constitutional scholars are unclear how even the most basic questions would be resolved.More than 34 states appear to have standing requests to change the Constitution, some dating back more than 150 years, according to the Article 5 Library, a bare-bones website that scholars pointed to as the best known repository of applications to change the Constitution.The list reads like a chronicle of generational concerns. In the early 20th century, more than 20 states wanted to insert anti-polygamy laws into the Constitution. In 1949, six states wanted to create a world federal government. Many of those applications remain active....Given the broad control that Republicans will have in Washington next year, other Democratic-led states may be motivated to rescind their constitutional convention requests. Lawmakers in Vermont, Massachusetts and Connecticut previously introduced resolutions to take back their applications, but those measures stalled.By the count of David Super, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center and an expert on constitutional conventions, the highest number of active requests for a convention on one specific topic is 28, for a balanced budget. But, he said, if Article V is interpreted as allowing any request to count toward convening a constitutional convention, the 34-state threshold has already been reached.If Congress declares under whatever crazy counting theory the convention advocates support that weve met the threshold, then well have a convention, Mr. Super said.This, along with so many other issues that are facing the nation, seems to indicate that relying solely on the founding documents to determine contemporary and future policy decisions is not necessarily a helpful way to go. It would make more sense to continually revisit how we are governed so that there aren't these anachronistic vestiges that could potentially be (mis)interpreted to justify bad-faith actions now and in the future.","title":"A Constitutional Convention?

State Court judges in Texas are elected on a district basis.  So those are the salaries of elected officials.   Texas State District Court judges (trial court judges) have a starting salary of $140,000 up to a maximum of $168,000.  The system has a built in adjustment for certain HCOL counties of up to $18,800 per year.    So a district judge living in Hereford Texas might start at $140k, but one in Austin might make $168,800 starting.   \\n**FEDERAL** district court judges are appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate.   The Starting salary of a federal district court judge is $243,300 per year.   There are no \\"raises\\" per se, but there is a plan for annual salary adjustments yearly based on some inflation metric.   As recently as 2019, the salary of a federal district judge was $210,900 per year.  However, it is worth noting that the vast majority of individuals who meet the resume qualifications to be appointed as a US district Judge (excepting the first trump administration) have resumes that would enable salaries MUCH higher than $250k if they were in private practice. About 10-15% of all lawyers in the US work in large law firms serving corporate clients, which other than successful personal injury lawyers get the highest pay.    Currently, biglaw associates earn $190k to start and go up to $400k as senior associates. The partners at those firms earn more depending on their particular work.  \\nThe judge in this particular case was a federal district judge, so likely collected the $243k salary.","title":"The Biden overtime rule was struck down.

If the department had the authority to create and enforce the old standards, how can the judge be the sole determiner that the amount of the threshold increase is suddenly cause for having exceeded authority now?  **THE RULING**\\nOn Nov. 15, U.S. District Judge Sean D. Jordan of the Eastern District of Texas ruled that the Labor Department had exceeded its authority in issuing the overtime rule, finding fault with the new salary threshold, which he said was too high, and with the automatic updating.**THE RULE STRUCK DOWN**\\nThe Biden administration's overtime rule, which was finalized in 2021, was designed to increase the number of workers eligible for overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). This rule updated the salary threshold for overtime exemptions, meaning more workers would be entitled to overtime pay when they work over 40 hours a week.Here are the key points of the rule:Salary Threshold Increase: The rule raised the salary threshold for \\"white-collar\\" workers (those in executive, administrative, or professional roles) to qualify for overtime exemption from $23,660 (set in 2004) to $35,568 per year. This means workers earning less than this amount would be eligible for overtime pay.Annual Updates: The rule includes provisions for automatically updating the salary threshold every three years, adjusting for inflation, ensuring that it keeps pace with the economy.No Changes to Job Duties: The rule did not alter the existing \\"duties test\\" that determines whether employees perform exempt work, such as executive, administrative, or professional duties.","title":"The Biden overtime rule was struck down.

The systems aren't working for them. Liberalism isn't about up ending the status quo, it's about maintaining it and making marginal improvements. Conservative populism promises the change people so desperately want but lies about what it'll give them.

They provide insulation from financial risk by pooling risk across a number of people. In selling their product they have already factored in a profit margin and are able to do this because they have a significant information advantage. The average consumer of health care is not able to accurately predict how much health care they will need, while the insurance company insuring 100,000 people does know how much healthcare a group of 100,000 people is going to need.This is only part of it. The first is correct, in broad numbers, insurance companies know how to predict claims. This is quite easy because you have a large number of people and statistics work.The part you missed was the individual. This is a sample of one. All the statistics in the world aren't going to give you a very good prediction because of the standard deviation. This is why individuals pool resources and pay a premium to transfer risk to the insurance company.You insurance premium consists of two parts. The first is the expected or planned amount of healthcare needs. The second is the premium paid to transfer risk of having *more* healthcare costs than expected. But recently insurance companies want to have their cake and eat it to. They want to sell you health insurance that already costs you more than your health care (on average) will cost, but then when you use health care, turn around and say \\"actually we aren't going to pay for that health care you recieved.\\" So they still get paid, but they haven't done what you are paying them for (decreasing your risk of massive healthcare bills).This is called managing costs. It is a requirement to keep premiums low. Insurance companies are mandated to return 80-85% of premiums collected to claims. The remaining is for administration and profit. An insurer who denies all claims would be shut down by the insurance commission for violating this rule. One also needs to look at the denials with more detail. Initial denials can be for a lot of reasons - including the requirement to try other treatment options (lower cost) first. They can also be because paperwork is missing or justifications are missing. What is more interesting  is what is the rate of final denials or rate of denials that go to arbitration/court to be settled.Yes, there are other valid critiques of every aspect of how health care is delivered in our country, but insurance companies that don't actually cover your healthcare costs are purely parasiticExcept they are required by law to do this. What you are not happy about is companies who don't just 'pay everything' and instead refer back to the plan documents for what is and is not covered and what procedures need to be followed for preauthorizations. Cost control must be done to keep insurance affordable. There is no way around it.","title":"CMV: Executives of healthcare insurance companies are no more guilty for the deaths of patients than any other decision maker within the healthcare sector"},{"text":"Season 03 is one of the best things out there.

Now I'm sure that someone here can provides studies and statistics that show otherwise, but for most people, it seems like common sense that flooding the market with new workers is likely to drive down wages. So you are fighting a battle against that common sense, and Democrats' main defense against that common sense has been to point to spreadsheets. It's not a good defense.Besides that, the message is that our economy is going to collapse if we don't have a constant supply of cheap labor coming into the country. I do not see how that is a compelling message. And if our economy is that precarious, maybe we have bigger problems to address (and we definitely do!).

I think that your connection between UFO belief and religions is an apt one.To be vulnerable, I can identify with this. I grew up in a Christian cult, and though Ive been an avowed atheist for years now, I can feel that learned desire for a savior figure inside of myself. Ive always been fascinated with aliens, and when I was young and in the cult, there were many around me who believed that UFO or alien sightings were encounters with angels or demons, often pointing to biblical narratives as proof. I can find the exact same arguments in all of the UFO subs right now.I can definitely sense a lack of critical thinking in myself when I watch one of the more believable drone videos. It IS comforting to feel like a non human intelligence is coming to save the day or at least provide enough conflict that it helps redirect the energy of human civilization to fight a common enemy. More than any of that, though: its fun. Its just fun to consider, even for a minute, that aliens are on earth. It produces a sense of wonder (also a religious phenomenon), and when engaging in that belief with other believers, helps one find a sense of community. Thats exactly why so many people embrace evangelicalism and other styles of fundamentalist religious beliefs. Frankly, thats why people join any sort of movement. A feeling of groupthink and the recognition of others is extremely powerful.Thanks for sharing.

They've been doing this for many years. No matter how much harm they do, they continue to remain adamant that Democrats are just bad and could never do good.They said that with Hillary Clinton who said she would get *Citizens United* and money=speech overturned--and she would have done that.They said that when Democrats moved far 'to the left' after the 2018 landslide. BTW, the reason Democrats moved far to the left was because they won in a landslide. That gave them the room to move. Democrats will move 'to the right' when Republicans win. This is how basic competition works: You try to win over the largest block of potential customers.They said that when the most progressive government we have seen in generations got so much done in 2021 and 2022 despite a 50-50 Senate.They will always say that.

I think its Obama who is pulling the strings. Theres that quote where he actually said he wishes he could have a third term but just be behind the scenes running everything with a puppet being the face of the president. I mean, you dont even have to stretch what he said at all to try and make it fit into that narrative; he just outright said that. I believe him. I feel pretty comfortable saying that he was likely the puppet master over the past four years. As for whats going on now, Id put my money on the deep state and rogue agencies running things and trying their hardest to do as much nefarious shit as they can before Trump gets inaugurated. Again, it isnt really a stretch to believe this theory either. So ultimately, Biden has been a figurehead for the last four years, Obama got his third term, there more or less isnt an acting president at the moment, and bureaucrats in corrupt agencies are trying to sabotage Trump as much as the can before his is back in office and hopefully scatters their corruption into the wind. Again, Im not really very invested in these theories, but I absolutely do think that they are completely plausible and certainly not out of the realm of possibility.","title":"It's Dec 2024.

AfD in Germany also gained power because of people making fun of certain groups, maybe making fun of the less developed eastern germany and also some men groups Source that they gain power because of that?Please realise that \\"mainstream media\\", e.g. media owned by rich people and corporations, are not \\"the left\\" - even if they sometimes should say correct things and not just parrot right-wing propaganda. They love to focus on the person and what has been said rather than policy. Part of that might be policy discussions not giving good ratings, but there's also a serious filtering going on, where knowledgeable, policy-focused journalists are pushed out, or they attempt to not employ them in the first place.If you hear a left-wing person talking, they're probably talking about ways to get better healthcare, education and elderly care, or steps we can take to reduce poverty. Tax cuts for the poor and raising taxes on the right, to put the brakes on the rampant growth of social inequality. Those are the core issues of the Left as a tent, internationally. Sure, it can be possible to lure them off message (e.g. right-wing person says \\"people with red hair should be put in camps and forced to work as slaves until we send them to Antarctica!\\" and then the left-wing person says \\"no, that's horrible!\\" - I'm on purpose not using one of the real recent examples because that would completely distract from the point). But if the politician is not trying to advocate ways of making progress for the general Left goals, they are probably not actually on the Left (but instead maybe Centrist? Or Center-right?). \\"Liberal\\" in general in Europe is center-right, very closely aligned with Conservatives economically even if they take a more egalitarian approach on social issues.I'm actually not sure whether \\"making fun of the right\\" would help or not, I am not advocating for that as a strategy, but as someone who's been in Left circles, that's something I primarily see from corporate media and streamers trying to get more views and likes. So I take issue with the idea that your bullet points are a sensible representation of \\"the Left trying to help its causes\\".What clearly does help (unfortunately) is making fun of an opponent candidate in a two-way race; you can see how this escalates a lot in countries where there are just two real contenders. More candidates mean there's less to gain from it, and ranked choice voting makes it even less appealing (you want the secondary or tertiary support of that candidate's support, you probably don't want to start demanding their birth certificate or say they don't know what country they are from).","title":"CMV: Villanizing or making fun of the right does not help the causes of the left"},{"text":"Hell be judged poorly.

There are two groups of people who react badly to lefties making fun of righties: people who are right-wing and thus feel personally attacked, and nice people who are opposed to ridicule in principle. The first group was already right-wing to begin with and would have voted for right-wing candidates anyway. Being mocked for it encourages them to mock you back, but it isn't what made them right-wing to start with. The second group is not blind and can see that right-wing folks also love ridiculing left-wing folks. Seeing lefties do the same doesn't make them support the right, it pushes them to disengage from politics altogether. Ultimately, people vote for right-wing candidates because they believe in right-wing ideas. They believe in right-wing ideas because their life experiences have shown them that those ideas work. In short, they believe in those ideas for the same reason you believe in gravity--because it seems self-evident to them. This is hard for lefties to accept because their life experiences have shown them something very different, but it's the truth.

That they are interested in expanding their territory not just protecting their pre-existing illegal buffer zone.To do this to a country that just overthrow a dictator that tortured thousands to death, a country trying to unite and make a bright future,  whose leadership have offered you no resistance even after you bombed them for  days, is a extreme level of callousness and cruelty.Frankly if Israel doesn't withdraw from its new buffer within two weeks,   the country should be put under the same level of sanctions as Russia.To demonstrate that no- you cannot steal  land from your neighbors. stealing it's residents rights to citizenship in their home countries or making them non citizens in their own homes.And if  instead Israel continue to expand their buffers to bufffers and never vacates, so many countries will doubt the security of their borders.

Arresting Trump in georgia and trying to shoot him and making fun of Trump supporters for being dumb and uneducated did not help democras win either 2016 or 2024 elections_The left did not shoot him or attempt to. But they were blamed for it anyway. Trump was arrested because he broke multiple laws in multiple states and the laws should be applied to everyone, even former presidents - particularly when they actively and consciously attempt to subvert democracy. But the left is seen as unreasonable for holding him accountable.This this example alone youre pointing to people on the left wing blaming them for something they did not do, so why would anyone on the left capitulate or be kind to a group that demknizes them for things they do not even do? If were going to be blamed for it, then we may as well make fun of them right back - because no matter what the left will be blamed. This example _also_ frames following the law and aiming to hold politicians accountable for their actions as detrimental. It does not matter that his supporters still support him. What matter is that there was enough evidence to put on him trial for breaking the law. So he should be tried. Whether or not it is strategically useful or not. Its the right thing to do. \\n_The GameGate movement and making fun of gamers pushed more gamers to the right and has led to an awful, awful discourse these days in the gaming social media (throwing in here stuff like Sweet Baby Inc)_It pushed white male gamers to the right. And theyre not the only demographic that plays video games. This was a misogynistic movement that went out of its way to harass women who worked in games, because a dev broke things off with her ex and he made up lies about her and her success. These folks dont like not being the only demographic that gets catered to by games. They would have found any excuse to rage against POC and women in their video games and SBI is a perfect example of that. Nothing would have stopped these gamers from getting upset beyond having less diversity, less games being made by and for diverse folks and being treated as the ONLY demographic that plays games. \\n_Villanizing ALL Israelis did not help the pro-palestine movement, Palestine is still bombed, the US wont change its mind on Israels support_This is a weird one because all I see is Israel being demonized (more like called out) for bombing and killing innocent people in Palestine and for committing war crimes. Which they are doing. Theyre committing war crimes and supporting and enforce an apartheid. Thats bad and worth being criticised? And almost all criticism is around the nation and its actions while acknowledging its just the citizens and even efforts to ensure all criticism is anti-Zionism and not antisemitism. _AfD in Germany also gained power because of people making fun of certain groups, maybe making fun of the less developed eastern germany and also some men groups_They gained power by feeding on and encouraging racism, xenophobia and the economic uncertainty in Germany. Lets not minimise their actions and aims. They have a politician who even publicly used a Nazi slogan. The problem with this kind of thinking is that there is not much evidence and we know that misinformation and disinformation on social media as well as algorithms that actively favour outrage as a way to keep users engaged is more impactful than whether or not some rando left winger made a shitpost about the right or a privileged demographic. Moreover I thought that when the right made racist/sexist/homophobic/etc remarks online they just jokes and the left needs to be less sensitive.(Maybe the right wingers who vote against their own interests because some people on the left were mean, need to be less sensitive and learn how to take a joke.) /s","title":"CMV: Villanizing or making fun of the right does not help the causes of the left"},{"text":"Everyone on reddit had the biggest galaxy brain after he dropped out.

The last thirty years have seen significant transformation due to globalisation of supply chains and information, breaking up both economic but also cultural silos. any change to the status quo will be met with opposition from a certain fraction of the society.This initial protest movement has been coopted by the far-right, and nationalism put into focus as remedy against a world in which global supply chains, global entertainment franchises and global information ecosystems make national identity lose meaning.the rise of a right-wing, fascism-aligned party in germany has multiple effects. conservatives have adopted right-wing culture war talking points in an attempt to sway those voters and bring them back into the fold. libertarians have discovered that the \\"foreigner versus poor\\" conflict is a great way of shifting the blame for economic woes from their CEO friends and their strategic missteps to the lower social strata, thus avoiding taking responsibility for the structural challenges arising from stagnation over the last forty years, and simultanously being able to campaign on cutting benefits to the disadvantaged and using it to benefit their top earners clientele. soc-dem and greens had little choice but to engage in the bad faith discussion of migration or be left out of the conversation alltogether, thus appearing to ignore any issues or grievances of their constituents. this led to an overall shift to the right in germany. the issues have been compounded by the inability to understand and utilize social media by the established parties, leading to a disproportionate advantage of fringe elements dominating online discourse.making fun of dumb people because they make telegram groups about chemtrails, lizard people and vaccines causing autism does not have the defining impact you make it to be.also   \\n\\\\ GG was about dudes hating on women and hiding behind \\"ethics in journalism\\". \\\\ Most poeple dont villanize all Israelis as you claim, but rather the ethnonaitonalist governement, particularly Likud and Otza Yehudim.

NPR does push back when misinformation and disinformation is verifiably incorrect/inaccurate, but it's not always evident in the interviews. Additionally, the right wing has created a paradigm where they will end interviews immediately when challenged - this is known as an educated person. So the fact checking takes place in addition resources like On The Media, follow-up reporting, and the NPR Editorial Newsletter that is emailed out weekly. In that newsletter, they address not only Listener criticism of the way that the right wing barfs up bullshit endlessly, but also explains why they permit it: The people need to hear these loons and morons lying and incriminating themselves. Beyond that, the individual has to evaluate the content. And as informed members of the public, we know from time, experience, and the ability to fact check that they're full of shit. And NPR carries that accountability forward into relevant reporting. If you need immediate editorial for the press coverage that you consume, maybe NPR News isn't for you.

A strong corporation uses its advantage over an individual patient. What is the point of paying for insurance for many years if when you have to use it, you really can't. Certainly, the company policy introduced by the CEO has much more severe effects on many more people than the actions of doctors/hospitals.I could agree if you argue that pharmaceutical companies are at a similar level of guilt to the CEO because they artificially inflate drug prices, but I don't think you can compare them to the rest.","title":"CMV: Executives of healthcare insurance companies are no more guilty for the deaths of patients than any other decision maker within the healthcare sector"},{"text":"Awesome","title":"Another Obama-appointed judge rescinds senior status and becomes third on federal bench to pull reverse retirement on Trump since he won the election"},{"text":"DNC has to be perfect and trump's bar is on the floor","title":"Harris and Biden urge Democrats to fight on in rare joint appearance"},{"text":"Because dems on a whole don't care.

Maybe you can somewhat blame certain groups for helping facilitate that change, but it was bound to happen. The powers that be are phenomenal at taking the rhetoric of people that oppose them and making it less threatening. Also I think anti-establishment thinking changes based on the current government's rhetoric. During the Cold War it was all anti-communist, anti-leftist stuff and promoted right wing values so the anti-establishment groups tended to lean left. But now that the government is using leftist talking points, it makes sense for the new anti-establishment to be more right leaning. If both right and left could make common cause and realize that the establishment's focus on profit above all else, including human life and a basic standard of living, is what's fucking us then a lot could be accomplished.

You are more than likely able to survive longer if you choose not to participate in risky endeavours, or you balance the risk such that the rewards are worthwhile (e.g., a profiting business).More education, especially that of women, leads to lower birth rates is the result of the economy; if you bring children into this world where you are self aware that is not financially feasible, then you're better off surviving to support yourself.Otherwise, the contrast of this logic is that you have uneducated women birthing with no forethought, and guess who asks for social welfare? Those kids are going to have a tough time advancing. Not impossible, but tougher than the kids who have a better head start because they were born into families that DID make the right decisions to financially position them well.Evolution favours those who make good decisions, where good is defined as \\"a choice that promotes a high probability of success relative to that time period that enables procreation\\".If you had a Nuke button that killed everyone except for you and some other chick, then guess what? You're officially Mohammad now. You can start the world as Day 0 of Patriarchy.But you don't have that button, so anyone that supports patriarchy and believes that evolution will lead this view to victory will have to play the game of life as everyone else: make good decisions.If the patriarchy model promotes high GDP, strong living conditions, and ability to promote strong offspring, then yes, the model will continue to progress down the generational tree and it flourishes.

Definitions are important.Evolution, in modern day time, and specifically targeting humans, favours humans who make good choices. You make poor decisions in life, then you will either die, or be stuck with poor mating partners, or never mate at all. In any of those three cases, you will be creating a generation of children who are statistically prone to failure, as other children who have successful parents with assets and the like are given a higher chance of success (e.g., private schooling, carpool to school, extracurriculars, etc). If you make poor decisions, you're less likely to earn enough to live a life worth living, or attracting other mates.One example of a poor decision is deciding to marry someone who supports patriarchy views. This assumes the woman will support this too, or at least be in the role regardless of how they feel, because in your words, \\"evolution doesn't care about suffering or belittling\\". This has a cascading chain of effect that influences their decisions, and their impact on the man of the house, and their future offspring negatively.

Where being patriarchal is involved, it seems to actually make the problem *worse*. This is because patriarchal societies don't really make it easy for women to be mothers, and don't offer much support to them. They expect them to run the household, raise the kids, (and probably have jobs too). Patriarchal societies are also more likely to reject cultural diversity and immigration, making them unable to bring in and naturalise immigrants in numbers high enough to cushion the demographic crisis.So for example, you gave examples of Japan, Russia, and South Korea. All of these countries are developed nations but are much more patriarchal than the typical developed Western nation. Yet their birth rates are lower (and yes, this generally holds true even when you exclude the birth rates of immigrants in Western nations).But maybe that's not enough to convince you.Let's test the theory. Is it being rich, or being patriarchal. Certain countries (Qatar, UAE, Saudi Arabia) are developed, and very patriarchal. They are also Islamic, which is particularly relevant to your point.According to my theory, they should be following the pattern of declining birth rates, and some might even already be a red flag for demographic collapse.According to your theory, they should have high birth rates and defy the pattern of non Islamic nations.Well, you can see demographic collapse well underway. Qatar is 1.8, UAE is 1.44. Only Saudi Arabia is higher at 2.4 but if you look at the curve they are following a general trend that mirrors their neighbors.You point out that evolution does naturally tend to favour those who successfully reproduce more. That is true. But when it comes to complex human traits - religiosity and the like - evolution moves extremely slowly. This is because such changes in the brain are very subtle and hard to code for. Much like it is much easier for a neurosurgeon to remove a chunk of your brain and make you an idiot than it is for them to remove a specific memory with surgical cuts. If the surgeon tries, they'd probably just give you brain damage. Similarly, Any mutation which attempts to impact the brain significantly will probably just cause a baby to be brain damaged /  spontaneously abort in the womb (1/3 of babies do this).It is probable, likely even, that you can't really code DNA for being patriarchal or not, and similarly for most other personality traits. Otherwise we would see different societies around the world having very different behaviour, reflecting how DNA has shaped their culture. You take a baby from India and raise them in America, they will behave the same as Americans. There isn't a DNA making an Indian baby grow up to behave differently to an American. It is much more likely that the current brain is basically a very delicate balance, and you can't mess with it much, at least on the timespan of millenia. Indeed, even with human brains being very stable, the rate of mental illnesses that are not evolutionarily advantageous (eg depression, autism, schizophrenia) to reproduction is quite high, indicating that evolution has been unable to select them out, because it would break something else important in the brain.Meanwhile, cultural changes, which compete to spread from human brain to human brain and replace other cultural ideas, can move extremely rapidly. And we see this. Societies across the world had already evolved to be very patriarchal, to favour very high rates of childbearing, etc over hundreds of thousands of years of natural selection. Yet in only a few short generations, populations the world over are embracing the notion that men are equal to women, rejecting patriarchy, and having low amounts of children.To borrow an aphorism. \\"Culture can go half way around the world before evolution has even finished putting it's pants on.\\"Christianity was also very patriarchal, and yet Christianity did not stop this wave. Even today, when we look at highly patriarchal Christian or Jewish offshoots - ones that encourage very high birthrates - yes they have children, but those groups also have extremely high de-conversion rates - many of those children immediately go and join the dominant culture - their brains have no protection against the allure of  modern, non-patriarchal culture. To maintain high rates of group membership, these offshoots have to go to extreme levels - like not teaching their children to read or write properly, or use basic technology, so that they cannot escape the group. So they survive and even grow, but at the expense of giving up their ability to participate in the skilled economy or be attractive to outsiders.Lastly, I'd like to look into the example of Saudi Arabia, since you might say well they have a rate of 2.4 kids, so this proves my point. To that, I'd say that even though 2.4 is actually very low by historical standards, even if you consider it \\"high\\" Saudi Arabia is the exception that proves the rule.Saudi Arabia is kind of unique in that it isn't just patriatchal and developed, it has until recently made it very hard for women to have jobs, but also been rolling in so much free cash that they could get away with it. In every other developed country (except perhaps Norway) they don't have infinite oil wealth to fund half your population sitting around at home not contributing to the productive workforce.Every other Islamic country that is modernising is facing the same pressures - to be competitive, wealthy, productive - women need to be in the workforce.And as South Korea, Japan and China show, if your culture is both patriarchal but also expects women in the workforce, women will have less babies. Because babies hurt their career, and having a career and a baby at the same time is super hard.Saudi Arabia is the exception that proves the rule because they are one of the few countries that can afford to ignore basic economics and chose to ignore it. Their oil wealth will eventually run out and when they do they will face the same incentives as everyone else.?Lastly, I'd just like to point out how silly your point is about Mohammed.Every other major cultural group in Britain tends to have a culture of valuing name diversity. In Islam being called Mohammed is a holy name. So of course it's going to be the most popular name for babies, even if Islam is a very small minority (which it is). It's because while any Christian name is never going to be more than 1% or whatever of the Christian  population, Mohammed is going to be 1/3 of the Islamic population, or similar. So if a population was 95% Christian, and 5% Islamic the most popular name would be.... Mohammed.So let's look at the actual stats. Over 10 years time the population of Muslims in the UK has increased... from 4.9%... to 6.5%.Meanwhile, ten years has seen continuing rapid cultural change and birth rate drop around the world.","title":"CMV: Islam is going to eventually dominate the world because evolution favors patriarchal societies.

And I agree with you on most points.I will try to change your mind based on one argument that I think wasnt sufficiently articulated by you.You correctly note that breasts are not sexual organs; and you also note in your comments that any body part (such as feet) can be sexualized. You also acknowledge that some degree of modesty is acceptable in society, as you do not advocate for nudism in all contexts. Therefore your argument focuses on the irrationality of womens breasts being considered sexual and not mens.However, modesty does not just pertain to sexual anatomy. For example, it is not permissible to display ones anus in any modern society I am aware of. The anus is not a sexual organ, but modesty prohibits it being displayed. This shows that modesty / indecency laws are not restricted to sexual organs.If a significant enough portion of society finds the exhibition of a particular body part immodest, then they will make it illegal. The general principles of equality and autonomy are here overridden by a common consensus around the societal cost of allowing that immodesty.What is that cost? Namely that enough men do sexualize womens breasts to the point of there even being strip clubs etc where men pay to see them; porn magazines; paid porn sites; etc. Yes, women pay to see naked men occasionally too, but by a much smaller margin. Men already sexualize womens bodies more than vice versa even without women toplessness in society. The liberation of womens tops would be a win for autonomy and equality, I agree, but a loss for many in society who would consider it distracting and overstimulating. I am not sure also if youve considered the potential increase of sexual harassment and assault as a result of this. Granted, one could argue that ultimately men should restrain themselves, and this is true, but if it led nonetheless to an increase in such crimes, would the autonomy and equality arguments be reason enough to remove the indecency laws?Here I am attempting to show there are real potential costs to changing such laws.","title":"CMV: Womens Toplessness Should Be Legal and Not Censored Online \\n"},{"text":"I hope Bernie can do it where Merrick Garland failed","title":"I surely hope to work with Trump to raise the minimum wage, Sen.

We are currently in a world where you do not gain power just by being strong, or a body builder.In this age of technology, you better learn how to adapt with consistent learning and know how to critically think and problem solve, because the jobs you have now will not be here in the future.

Therefore, it's no longer gender dependent, or biologically dependent favouring physical strength. Both genders can learn problem solving and critical thinking to invent new and thriving businesses and other solutions that make money for their family, and employ others to do the same.Edit: I ought to rant about skyrocketing housing and living costs.

Evolution is a process of natural selection over time. Random mutations in DNA result in a life form being more fit for it's environment, and thus it survives on.

Neoliberals take neoliberalism as a given, the default.  Famous examples from before the neoliberal revolution in the 1960s and 1970s when it became the standard include Milton Friedman, Ronald Reagan, Jack Kennedy, and Margaret Thatcher.  Specifically, neoliberalism is intended to be ambivalent about social issues.  Meaning neoliberals care about social issues as far as those social issues impact the bottom line.  This is in direct opposition to the \\"third way-ism\\" that neoliberalism became popular to combat in the 20th century.In the same way that fascism is capitalist revolution against socialism, neoliberalism is capitalist reform against social democracy.I can keep going, but it feels like a natural stopping point for this dunk contest you weren't even participating in.","title":"120 House Dems Call on Biden to Get Equal Rights Amendment Ratified"},{"text":"I have no idea what makes you think you know who I voted for.

While Trump had won, he still did lose the popular vote, didn't have much cultural support, and the state of the Democratic coalition at that point suggested he was likely to lose in 2020 no matter what. Conversely, however, there wasn't much Democratic political talent at the time -- the 2014 midterms were disastrous for the party, and many swing state governorships (WI, MI, NV, NM, etc.) were held by Republicans. Besides Hillary and Bernie, the only real viable candidate you could feasibly point to for 2016 was... who, Andrew Cuomo? It was dire.Now, the Democratic coalition looks the most fragile it's looked in a long time; the Obama coalition has all but collapsed, former swing states like Florida and Ohio are now deep red, nonwhite voters have darted right, Big Tech has begun to shift towards Trump, and Trump has a lot more cultural acceptance and appeal nowadays, and he is set to take advantage of a massive upswing in the economy.

Bernie Sanders says Biden should 'very seriously' consider preemptive pardons"},{"text":"\\"Guilty\\" is a weighty word and perhaps being misused but because this is such a politically-charged issue, weighty words tend to make more people pay attention. I agree with your post but I do think I should note that an insurance executive being \\"guilty\\" of helping to perpetuate a system of immorality is almost entirely powerless to control that \\"guilt\\", thus the guilt actually falls on the company itself even though the executive is technically \\"guilty\\" by association.My personal views on this issue are very complicated. As a Canadian who has observed multiple glaring failures in our so-called \\"universal\\" healthcare system, as well as misconceptions from Americans about how our system here works and also having known several people either die or get progressively worse waiting for healthcare to the point where some Canadians are selling their assets and travelling to foreign countries (including America itself) for timely, efficient healthcare, I find that I'm too emotional when it comes to debating anything healthcare-related. I also have a number of American friends who could have received free healthcare through various charities and hospitals but refused because the charity was affiliated with a religion they didn't like or because they felt like they weren't \\"sick enough\\" to need to rely on charity even when their illness or injury was very severe.This being said, my basic view is that while the responsibility doesn't directly fall on the shoulders of insurance companies, insurance companies are at least partly \\"guilty\\" in the sense that they present themselves as a safety net there to help average Americans in a sort of gaslighting while simultaneously doing everything in their power to make getting coverage as difficult, cumbersome and overcomplicated as it can possibly be, while fundamentally they must know that they are doing this to people who are at their most exhausted and vulnerable. Insurance is a product and like any product there's a cost, but insurance companies essentially get you to pay up-front for a product that doesn't yet exist and will only exist if you meet their never-ending sea of terms and conditions. The shift away from paper to digital applications has made things even more complicated - some insurance companies now require multi-factor authentication, are incorporating the usage of \\"bots\\" in lieu of customer service from a real human being, use flashy web graphics that don't work properly or display properly on older devices... even from a capitalist standpoint, it makes no sense to be paying for a product that you'll only receive if the seller (the insurance company itself) approves your claim to it under their terms and conditions. To be fair universities run on a similar model wherein tuition is paid up-front with the promise of an education, but in this case there's a good faith mutual agreement and the student is actually in the active progress of receiving the education unless they do something wrong or fail to study and do the work. It's a little different when you're paying an insurance company for something intangible until the point at which you actually need it, after which you have to jump through hoops to prove you really need it at a time when you may be severely sick or injured and in no position to be haggling. There's an episode of the crime drama TV series Cold Case that I would argue everybody interested in the healthcare debate should watch titled \\"Sabotage\\" (yes, it also focuses around a vigilante who took the law into his own hands). It illustrates very well the trajectory the average American may soon be facing in an increasingly globalized dog-eat-dog world and how the problem is the system more than it is any one individual or even corporation. Still, it does illustrate very well that the increasing apathy within the corporate world to the plight of the individual is ultimately going to lead to apathy back in turn. What the insurance company probably perceives as \\"nothing personal, just business\\" is of course perceived as very cruel and personal to the man who just held his little girl's hand as she died from what could have been a treatable cancer had the insurance company approved his claim, or the parents who have to use the money they'd been saving for their son's college tuition to pay for dad's shoulder surgery because his claim was denied. It feels especially personal if you've been actively making insurance payments to that company so that you could access that safety net when you needed it.I don't wish to debate vigilatism either, but look, we do need to address the elephant in the room but only in a very indirect way. I don't think it's ever moral or justified to murder or cause harm to a person simply because they're high-up in a corporation (and I am extremely disturbed by the number of people who find it justified or even comedic that a husband and father was gunned down in the street by a mentally unhinged assassin). Why I bring this up is because I don't believe the average American is aware of just how little power and control a CEO or CFO actually has over a corporation, especially if that corporation is publicly-traded. A corporation's legal mandate is to make money, as much money as it possibly can, not to lose money. If a CEO does the moral thing but not the moneymaking thing, he/she will simply be voted out of their position by their shareholders and replaced, and the corporation will continue doing whatever makes the most money, essentially continuing the exact same immoral behaviour. Even if a company is private, its goal is still to make money and if any employee or representative of that company decides to infringe upon this pattern in order to do the moral thing, they'll eventually just be terminated, demoted or replaced, or they'll keep their position until the company hemorrhages money and another company will just move into that space and keep perpetuating the same pattern as before. I would argue that this does make the insurance company itself \\"guilty\\" and that admitting this reality doesn't have to mean supporting vigilantism or hurting individual people.","title":"CMV: Executives of healthcare insurance companies are no more guilty for the deaths of patients than any other decision maker within the healthcare sector"},{"text":"They didn't even talk the talk this time.

I'm surprised out of the whole group, that's the worst example they found. It's not like it's Joe by himself picking who gets commuted, though.Here is some insight into the slightly sloppy process:But the White House did not consider any of those details when weighing the charges against Conahan or the cases of other individuals who received commutations on Thursday, said the administration official, who was granted anonymity to discuss the clemency process. Instead, the administration granted commutations en masse to all those who fit a broader set of parameters, touting the move as a record-setting act of mercy carried out just before the holidays.Those commutations were extended to people on Covid-related home confinement after federal authorities verified that their offenses were nonviolent and not a sex offense or terrorism related, the official said. They were also all considered a low risk for recidivism, had not engaged in any violent or gang-related activity while in prison and had been on good behavior for at least a year. None of the commutations granted were individual decisions, the official added, and none who met the criteria were excluded.The administration official defended the commutations for Conahan and others as a sign of Bidens commitment to second chances, rather than a commentary on the presidents opinion of their original offenses.Still, the official downplayed the impact on Conahans sentence in particular, arguing that he had served the bulk of his sentence, was already on home confinement and likely would have been released in August 2026 without the commutation.[https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/13/biden-clemency-judge-michael-conahan-000890](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/13/biden-clemency-judge-michael-conahan-000890)","title":"Sanders: We can all understand Hunter Biden pardon, but worried about precedent"},{"text":"Literally part of the reason Trump shrunk Grand Staircase - Escalante National Monument is because Senator Mike Lee lobbied for it because he wanted to be able to pave the Hole In the Rock Road so they could run tour buses all the way down, because it's a major mormon historical site and they want to cash in on that sweet, sweet tourism money.

Theyll encourage both the right and the left to engage in adventurism, selling each side the same narrative: that the enemy is mobilizing, so you must get in the streets to fight back. Like last time, major targets of this agitation propaganda will be the most conspiratorial elements within MAGA; the ones who believe in QAnon, or in the psyops that have replaced QAnon. This time, though, the feds will also focus on agitating another element: the antifa anarchists. The psyop directed towards the left will be that a unique fascist threat has arisen, and that we have to resist it through violence if necessary. And an inverse psyop will be directed towards the right; ultraviolent leftist groups, cultivated by the intelligence agencies, will be used to demonize Palestine supporters while spreading anti-communist paranoia.What I find is that a lot of \\"revolutionaries\\" and \\"left wing\\" types forget their history and want to help foster a world of violence which is usually called [Ultra Leftism](https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-7/basoc-20-years.htm)Ultra-left (or left) errors generally involve overestimating how close the country is to revolution. Typically, a left framework pictures the spontaneous resistance of the working class as an indication of revolutionary class consciousness; isolated militant actions or individual advanced workers are regarded as representative. Ultra-leftists downplay the contradictions within the working class (such as racism, sexism, homophobia) or between the working class and its potential allies. The influence of communists (or of the particular organization making this analysis) is exaggerated: the roots of communists in the working class, the respect of the people for the communists, the development of revolutionary program, tested leadership, committed cadreCall are overestimated. The road to revolution is envisioned as relatively smooth (and the turns and twists of revolutions in other countries are regarded with disdain).Some ultra-leftists think that they live in permanently revolutionary conditions that only await bold action by revolutionaries; others anticipate a spontaneous act of popular resistance that can be turned into a revolutionary uprising by ingenious communists. The different variations of this perspective all amount to thinking that we are in a situation where a single spark can start a prairie fire.[Lenin called it adventurism:](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/jun/09.htm)The history of Russian Social-Democracy teems with tiny groups, which sprang up for an hour, for several months, with no roots whatever among the masses (and politics without the masses are adventurist politics), and with no serious and stable principles. In a petty-bourgeois country, which is passing through a historical period of bourgeois reconstruction, it is inevitable that a motley assortment of intellectuals should join the workers, and that these intellectuals should attempt to form all kinds of groups, adventurist in character in the sense referred to above.

They provide insulation from financial risk by pooling risk across a number of people. In selling their product they have already factored in a profit margin and are able to do this because they have a significant information advantage. The average consumer of health care is not able to accurately predict how much health care they will need, while the insurance company insuring 100,000 people does know how much healthcare a group of 100,000 people is going to need.But recently insurance companies want to have their cake and eat it to. They want to sell you health insurance that already costs you more than your health care (on average) will cost, but then when you use health care, turn around and say \\"actually we aren't going to pay for that health care you recieved.\\" So they still get paid, but they haven't done what you are paying them for (decreasing your risk of massive healthcare bills).Yes, there are other valid critiques of every aspect of how health care is delivered in our country, but insurance companies that don't actually cover your healthcare costs are purely parasitic","title":"CMV: Executives of healthcare insurance companies are no more guilty for the deaths of patients than any other decision maker within the healthcare sector"},{"text":"That's not all they do: insurers administrate the health insurance plan.

I'd more or less agree that hospitals have a large amount of culpability for the current state of things, but basically what you can say about the hospital is that in the current system they set the price of services and goods very high knowing that the insurance company will negotiate it downwards. The assumption of the system is generally that you will be covered by insurance, when you get an insane bill it's often because your insurance refused to cover it so they also did not negotiate the price. I'd like to see hospital systems stop treating individuals like they are massive insurance companies but that's also the current system.At the end of the day what you can say is different about the above two groups is that they actually provide the services and goods they say they will provide.On the other hand, insurance companies regularly look for ways to reject claims, or shift more of the bill to your responsibility regardless of the terms of your policy. They literally try not to provide what you pay them for at every turn and are a large part of the reason why prices are so high in medical systems. Where the hospital systems have many things wrong with them largely because they are for profit as well, many of those problems are the direct result of the current expectations that medical care will be covered by insurance companies.","title":"CMV: Executives of healthcare insurance companies are no more guilty for the deaths of patients than any other decision maker within the healthcare sector"},{"text":"why does that excuse it? joe biden was so incompetent they released 1500 people without checking what crimes they committed somehow makes it better?","title":"Sanders: We can all understand Hunter Biden pardon, but worried about precedent"},{"text":"yup freaks","title":"Joe &amp; Jill Bidens Christmas White House vs Donald &amp; Melania Trumps Christmas White House"},{"text":"Literally no publications proofread anymore except for maybe on their major national headlines.","title":"Blunt Democratic senator roasts those cheering CEOs killing"},{"text":"Good luck","title":"What would happen if suddenly the entire world internet was limited to 28k dial-up modem speeds?"},{"text":"The same John Fetterman who was \\"deeply disappointed\\" by Joe Biden's threat to stop helping Israel mow down Palestinian children?

Meanwhile, UHC has been making $20 billion, roughly, every year. Is there financial waste at my hospital? Definitely. But I guarantee theres plenty of financial waste at UHC too.

But politely, I disagree that erections and breasts are an equivalent comparison.Breasts aren't sex organs- they're fat deposits and, sometimes, milk dispensers- but lactation doesn't really matter in this argument. To my understanding, mothers have to make a sustained effort to continue lactating, and don't want to 'waste the product.' Excepting breast-feeding mothers and individuals with SEVERE hormone imbalances (men can lactate on occasion. It's incredibly odd.) the breasts of overweight men/ men with oddly distributed fat and the breasts of women should be treated equally. Just mounds of muscle and fat. Sure, maybe not everyone wants to see them and maybe some people will be perverts  and ogle, but it's at the individuals discretion whether or not they display their chests. Even if they are not inherently sexual, male erections involve the genitalia- the sex organs. So even if an erection is not sexual, the body part it involves is. Male genitalia is formed for sexual reproduction- so while it is used for other non-sexual purposes (urination), erections are derived from the sexual properties of the organ (it's shape and ability to penetrate). One can urinate without male genitalia but (barring any fringe cases I'm unaware of) one cannot get an erection without male genitalia. Erections are a result of the sexual function of the phallus.   \\nAdditionally, erections are temporary. Breasts are permanently present on the male, female, and intersex body. It's unfair to say that breasts and male erections are equally sexual and therefore unfit for public display- a woman cant slice off or shrink her breasts by taking a cold shower or thinking of her grandma. Females can't will away their boobs to get insta-mastectomies.Comparing unintentional erections to a permanent fixture on both male and female bodies is a false equivalence. Women can unintentionally vaginally lubricate ( the term 'arousal fluid' doesn't really work here) as a result of medication, too- or for absolutely no reason at all. That would be a better point of comparison to an erection. Comparing the groin to the bust is just apples and oranges.","title":"CMV: Womens Toplessness Should Be Legal and Not Censored Online \\n"},{"text":"I did not say that at all.

That certainly seems like a change from history where if a student showed signs of a medical ailment (other than child abuse) their consent would not be required for that information to be shared with a parent.

The institutionalist Dems like Pelosi and Schumer sat on their asses and tried to keep the populists and leftists quiet while complaining about them not doing enough to stop the far right. The populist moderate Dems like Biden and Harris were smacked down as terrible candidates by the people in the coalition that built them up but also plotted against them and kneecapped their campaigns with contradicting and scheming perspectives. The populist leftists like Sanders and AOC indicted Biden and Harris along with everyone else for not rebuking and alienating more across the spectrum and going full on left populist hoping to wake up the voters to how badly the GOP and elites are skullfucking them, their rights, and their bank accounts.Meanwhile the voting base is just coping and seething against one another looking for what is essentially a messiah to a problem the American citizenry voted for.

They are more and more just a way for some politicians to put their name on something and appear concerned about the environment.Meanwhile they take lands that saw very little usage prior to the designation and then put parking lots and roads in, which bring 100x the number of people not to mention actually altering the land in ways that old 2-track roads and a few ATV'ers or 4x4s never came close to doing, then the trash builds up and starts blowing around, and the \\"protection\\" ends up being exactly the opposite.And then the local people who actually used those lands, who actually cared about them, whom the lands actually meant something to and who interacted with those lands daily now can no longer access the actual areas they used to access and are limited to the rules-based usage and useless fees, all so the areas can be polluted more and less accessible than they once were, and now filled with people passing through and stopping for a few hours who don't care and leave dirty needles, used condoms, garbage, and all so they can take a quick day hike in a place they will forget in a few weeks.I fully expect few to no one on Reddit to understand this though because ignoring the largely urban population here who simply don't understand it from a local's perspective, around here anything that bears the right names like \\"National Monument\\" must surely only be good because it means everyone has access. Well, everyone already has access. We don't need more pavement, rules, fees, garbage, and vandals.","title":"Trump downsized national monuments. Biden restored them.

Trump's McCarthyist Tendencies**Populist Rhetoric and Demonization**\\nTrump, like McCarthy, has built a base of support among working-class whites by combining populist criticism of elites with exaggerated depictions of foreign threats[1]. Both figures have used inflammatory language to polarize the country and pit Americans against each other[2].**Attacks on Critics and Media**\\nSimilar to McCarthy's approach, Trump frequently attacks his critics and the media, often singling out reporters by name[5]. This tactic of intimidation aims to stifle dissent and control the narrative.**Loyalty and Purges**\\nTrump's administration has shown a propensity for demanding loyalty and removing those perceived as disloyal, reminiscent of McCarthy-era loyalty oaths and purges[4]. The proposed \\"Project 2025\\" initiative aims to identify and remove federal employees seen as hostile to Trump, echoing McCarthyist blacklists[4]. Amplified Threat from the Executive Branch**Unprecedented Power**\\nUnlike McCarthy, who was a senator, Trump's potential return to the presidency would grant him executive powers far exceeding those of McCarthy. This includes control over federal agencies, including the Department of Justice and FBI[4].**Technological Advantages**\\nModern technology and social media provide Trump with tools for surveillance and information dissemination that far surpass what was available during the McCarthy era[4]. This could lead to more targeted and effective campaigns against perceived enemies.**Armed Support**\\nTrump has the backing of armed militias and has promised to pardon January 6 participants, suggesting a potential for violent intimidation that McCarthy lacked[4]. Potential Consequences**Widespread Intimidation**\\nA second Trump administration could see McCarthyism-like tactics applied on a broader scale, targeting not just government employees but also elected Democrats, liberal organizations, and individuals[4].**Constitutional Concerns**\\nTrump's statement about potentially \\"terminating\\" parts of the Constitution raises serious concerns about the rule of law and democratic norms[8].**Economic and Social Impact**\\nAs with McCarthyism, many Americans could face job losses, blacklisting, and social ostracism based on political beliefs or associations[9].In conclusion, while the parallels between Trump and McCarthy are clear, the potential for a Trump-led McCarthyism from the executive branch presents a more severe threat to American democracy and civil liberties. The combination of executive power, modern technology, and a polarized political landscape could lead to a period of political repression and social division far exceeding that of the original McCarthy era.Sources\\\\\\n[1] [PDF] Donald Trump's Foreign Policy: McCarthyism as a Cautionary Tale https://css.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/gess/cis/center-for-securities-studies/pdfs/PP4-10.pdf\\\\\\n[2] The Apprentice: Donald Trump and Joe McCarthy https://www.cjr.org/politics/trump-mccarthy-time.php\\\\\\n[3] McCarthyism | Definition, History, &amp; Facts - Britannica https://www.britannica.com/event/McCarthyism\\\\\\n[4] How a second Trump administration would bring back McCarthyism https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2024/7/5/2250160/-How-a-second-Trump-administration-would-bring-back-McCarthyism\\\\\\n[5] GOP silence on Trump's false election claims recalls McCarthy era https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/01/politics/gop-silence-trump-false-election-claims-mccarthy/index.html\\\\\\n[6] Decades before Trump's election lies, McCarthy's anti-communist ... https://www.npr.org/2021/10/18/1046648461/decades-before-trumps-election-lies-mccarthys-anti-communist-fever-gripped-the-g\\\\\\n[7] McCarthyism - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism\\\\\\n[8] Is this Donald Trump's Joe McCarthy moment? - The Hill https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/3771516-is-this-donald-trumps-joe-mccarthy-moment/\\\\\\n[9] Broadside for the Trump Era: McCarthyism 1947C1960 | Verso Books https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/news/3681-broadside-for-the-trump-era-mccarthyism-1947-1960","title":"'This is actually how democracy dies': Experts denounce ABC's settlement of Trump lawsuit"},{"text":"He didnt lie","title":"Mitt Romney: Democrats bungled and botched 2024"},{"text":"Seriously?
