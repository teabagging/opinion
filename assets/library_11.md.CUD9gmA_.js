Lump-sum alimony: A one-time, substantial payment.\\n5. Modification-resistant alimony: Alimony that cant be adjusted even if circumstances change, such as job loss or decreased income.**Division of Assets**1. Equitable distribution: Not always a 50/50 split; often disproportionately favors the spouse perceived as more financially vulnerable.\\n2. Retirement accounts (401k, pension): Loss of significant portions of retirement savings, including future benefits.\\n3. QDRO (Qualified Domestic Relations Order): Allows an ex to claim a portion of the mans pension, 401k, or other retirement accounts even before retirement age.\\n4.

Court-mandated medical expenses: Ordered to cover health care costs, premiums, or other medical expenses for the ex or children.**Tax Implications**1. Capital gains taxes: Divorcing couples may sell assets like homes or stocks, triggering capital gains taxes.\\n2.

Mike Pence found some classified documents at his home in Indiana. Pence found these documents in 2023 after having engaged a couple of lawyers to search his belongings to make sure he didn't have classified documents. Since he immediately turned them over, no charges were filed. Again, this falls under the same negligence as Clinton and Trump but I think Pence should walk because he immediately turned over the documents and consented to a search that uncovered one additional document.**Trump** \\\\- The government was alerted to Trump having possession of classified documents after he complied with a NARA request to return presidential records he improperly took on leaving office. Trump had returned a number of boxes including some containing heavily classified material. NARA freaked out and called the DOJ because they weren't even authorized to look at this shit.The DOJ opened an investigation (just like they did with the other three, as they should) and realized that it was likely Trump had more documents due to the method by which the documents were stored.At this point they reached out to Trump and said \\"Hi, we're the DOJ. We think you might have classified documents, please give back everything with a classified marking. Immediately.\\" Trump refused. Trump goes on to try and deny the DOJ access to the boxes that he'd already turned over, claiming that they needed to \\"Ascertain whether any specific document is subject to privilege\\"In may of 2022 a grand jury issues a subpoena requiring Trump to turn over documents. Trump talks to his lawyers who all tell him 'Turn over the documents, it is a subpoena\\". Trump asks \\"Wouldn't it be better if we just told them we don't have anything here?\\"Walt Nauta, Trump's co-conspirator lies to the FBI about his knowledge of movement of the boxes that he himself had moved repeatedly. He lies about where they were stored. He lies about whether that room had a lock.In June Trump directs one of his lawyers to search the boxes. She finds 38 classified documents. Trump asks \\"Did you find anything? ... is it ba? Good? and makes a plucking motion suggesting they take out anything bad.Unbeknownst to her, Trump had Nauta move 64 of the boxes from the storage room to his residence, then had 30 moved back. That is to say, he his the boxes from his own lawyers.Trump's lawyer signs an certification indicating that they had fully complied with the subpoena when she hands over the 38 documents that she has. To her knowledge, these are all the documents that remained, as Trump had concealed the rest from her.July 2022 - The Grand Jury is shown video of the boxes being moved in June, indicating that Trump likely concealed documents. This is then shown to a judge who finds it to be sufficient probable cause to obtain a search warrant. The FBI searches Mar-a-Lago and finds 102 classified documents.So with all that said, do we find intent? Obviously, yes. And Trump had no one to blame but himself.If Trump had complied with the initial DOJ request in May, he wouldn't have been charged. There would have been an investigation, it would have been embarassing, but he could have reasonably argued \\"Shit, I accidentally took a bunch of boxes of classified materials, whoops\\". Negligent, yup! Criminal? Nope.But that wasn't what he did. Even after being alerted to his possession of classified documents, he withheld them. He lied to the government, moved the documents in an attempt to conceal them and the government ultimately had to get a search warrant for his fucking house because he refused to get them back.Do you understand the difference? Here, tl;dr:Biden, Clinton, Pence: All three were shitty and negligent, but immediately complied with the investigations to the best of their abilities. All missing documents were recovered by the government during voluntary searches.**Trump: Literally had to have the documents seized by the FBI as part of a search warrant because he categorically refused to simply turn them over.**That is the difference. That is a crime.It isn't lawfare. It is just law. If you steadfastly refuse to follow the law over and over and over again, eventually even the gentle touch DOJ has to do something. If trump has complied at any point he'd have avoided charges, but he refused to do so because he thought he was above the law.Turns out he was right on that last bit, but hey, america is fucked because people like you just decided to let him be king.","title":"CMV: Jack Smith should have insisted on being fired."},{"text":"The new 28th amendment of USA - Remote work is illegal","title":"Trump, DOGE would make a huge mistake waging war on remote work"},{"text":"This presidency will test the true power of state vs federal power in a bad way.

My sincere apologies.Im familiar with the maralago case. I know people say the difference between him and Biden and Hillary is how they complied with turning over the documents. Even though Hillary actually used bleach bit haha. But none of us ever expected Hillary to go down for that. The only people who go down for that are military members and members lower members of the public sector. We understand that this is how things work and we wouldnt spend too much time trying to lock Hillary up for sharing classified information that probably shouldnt have been classified in the first place. If you want to tell me more about it sure but I think you see my point that you guys have no interest in holding your side accountable for the same actionsSo the the difference between the two sides is *intent*. When you say \\"How they complied with turning over the documents\\" that is the ballgame. That is the whole thing right there, it is the reason Trump got charged and they didn't.The specific statute that all three were investigated under was \\"18 U.S. Code  793 - Gathering, transmitting or losing defense information\\". That statue **requires** intent for the action to be criminal. Negligence is not enough, not even gross negligence. Section f mentions gross negligence, but the procedural history of the espionage act shows that gross negligence in and of itself is not a crime.You make a note about military personnel getting hammered by this, but what you don't understand is that people in the military are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The UCMJ *does* make negligence a crime. There are a lot of things that it is criminal for soldiers to do, but not criminal for a layman, becasue they have different standards.So lets step away and look at what all three were alleged of doing:**Clinton** \\\\- Clinton decided she wanted to conduct her SoS business using a private e-mail server for convenience. This was a bad decision (it probably cost her the presidency) made largely for convenience as it allowed her to not have to use multiple devices.Through the investigation of her, it was found that she had transmitted a small number of classified documents through these emails. Some of these were retroactively classified, some of them were classified at the time. This was negligent, it was shitty behavior that should have resulted in the revocation of her security clearance, but it was not criminal.After the fact, she sent for the server to be wiped (as is fairly standard, you don't want your private e-mails just sitting around.) after retaining any SoS e-mails. After a congressional subpoena, a staffer (who was not her employee, but basically the equivilent of 'that guy at circuit city you left your pc with) realized he hadn't actually done his job in deleting the e-mails, and hastily did so which voilated a subpoena. This is bad, but you can't really lay it at her feet as obstruction, she'd ordered them deleted over a year before she was ever subpoena'd.Overall? Shitty. Nothing here is criminal, because she didn't intentionally take and withhold classified documents. Do I think she sucks? Absolutely. But do I think it is a crime? No. She didn't willfully withhold classified material, she didn't obstruct justice. I don't think she should have been charged and the DOJ agreed.**Biden** \\\\- A small number of documents were found at the Penn-Biden Center while they were cleaning it out after Biden returned to the white house. Biden immediately alerted the DOJ who swept the office. Then his home. Then his other home and other offices.A number of documents were found during this search. They were clearly mishandled, but not concealed. The very fact that biden *immediately* turned over the documents and cooperated with voluntary searches puts paid to the idea that he was witholding or concealing them.The only documents at issue here are his personal journals. Biden made some offhand comments about 'the classified stuff is downstairs' while talking to his biographer. This could indicate intent, but the documents in question were his personal journals. Under a precedent set by Ronald Reagan, Biden had a reasonable belief that he had the right to keep his personal journals, even if they contained classifed material. The special prosecutor agreed and no charges were filed.","title":"CMV: Jack Smith should have insisted on being fired."},{"text":"**Attorney General?Merrick Garland?has received criticism from left-leaning figures after the federal case over President-elect?Donald Trump's alleged criminal attempts to overturn the 2020 election results was dropped.**\\\\U.S. District Judge?Tanya Chutkan?approved?special counsel Jack Smith's request?to dismiss the case surrounding the events leading up to the January 6 attack on the Capitol in the wake of Trump's 2024 election victory.The?Department of Justice?has a policy of not prosecuting sitting presidents.

We might all serve the same roles in our society, but we all have a duty to withold the freedoms we are accustomed to.Fear is a very powerful tool, but it is not the most powerful tool. Many Americans are subjected to a learned helpessness. However, our society has acheived great things such as civil rights, public funding of healthcare, education, the pursuance of peace, etc. The problem arises from a lack of our current insitutions to perserve personal freedoms over corporate interests or colonial pursuit. Together, we will make the world better, but we have to do it collectively. Americans are a bit comfortable, and when we get uncomfortable, it will probably garner the much needed change we need.

The PMs Government was found to have unlawfully infringed on Charter Rights through the improper invocation of the Emergencies Act to deal with the Trucker Convoy. Those are all factual occasions where the PM and his government broke the law.There are subjective instances that are more up for debate. In WE Charity, the PM only avoided another breach of the Conflict of Interests Act because siblings and parents (eg Michel Trudeau and Margaret Sinclair) are not included in the Acts definition concerning family member.The Liberal Government in 2020 tried to slip in unlimited tax and spend powers in the March Covid-19 relief package.

Its different, its dangerous, and normalizing this kind of behavior and rhetoric is an understated root cause of American political decline, not just a symptom. We should care about it more because it influences how folks govern, not just how they talk about it.As somebody who watches CBC and CTV almost every day do you think it might be that people just dont feel the same way you do about your characterization of events? Or that theyre holding themselves to a different journalistic standard and trying to withhold their biases? CTV and CBC both covered Poilievres presser today and offered a very measured analysis that was both critical and fair.?I mean, your title is that Poilievre is attacking the Team Canada approach. In reality (and you watched the presser so you know this), he was asked directly about if he would join the Team Canada approach. His response was that **he believes bipartisan politicians sitting around a table is a nice photo op, but that the response needs to be an action plan.**?And frankly, hes not totally incorrect on this point. CBC last night reported on Canadian business leaders who were part of Team Canada last time around that have gone to the USA over the past week to restart the work. Theyve been told outright by the Republicans that the strategies Canada employed last time wont work this time around. The USA will only respond to tangible policy changes.In that same presser Poilievre brought up defence spending. It is Americas (not just Trumps-Americas) #1 issue of contention with Canada. And what has the current government done recently? Well, they cut $3B over 3 years from defence in what former CDS Tom Lawson has called horrific 3 weeks ago. Additionally, the current Government is defending its plan to ask for another 8 years to hit 2% when weve had 10 years to get there according to the Wales Summit.Those are tangible policy changes that would address Trumps #1 issue on Canada. If you take the tariff employment at face value, its being used as a hard power tool to achieve some outcomes. Were not going to be able to get by on a friendly Team Canada approach.

Since Congress relinquished most of its control in 1962, the president can impose or lift these taxes on imported goods with minimal oversight. This essentially unilateral control provides fertile ground for corruption.During Trumps term in office, he wielded tariffs like a blunt instrument, frequently invoking them to achieve political goals, reward allies and punish adversaries.For example, when Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum in 2018 under the guise of national security, members of **Congress presented evidence that Trump administration officials were more likely to grant exemptions to companies with connections to the Trump family.** **The notable exemptions included a sanctioned Russian metals company with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.**","title":"Eric Trump demonstrates in 30 seconds he doesnt have a clue how tariffs work"},{"text":"I would say Por qu no los dos, but I don't want to be deported.","title":"Steve Bannon Reveals New List of Trumps Targets in Grim Rant"},{"text":"Nah, it's an illusion.

In multiple scandals, the RCMP has started investigations that were stymied by the government refusing to waive privilege and release evidence to assist in the investigation, leading to them being dropped. SNC-Lavalin is the most prominent example. The Harper Government had what was called the Duffy Scandal, in which a Conservative Senator was found to have been caught improperly using taxpayer funds. By comparison, the Harper Government waived privilege and turned over 100,000 documents to the RCMP to assist in their investigation.1. I am going to start with the Covid relief package because its probably the least well-known. In 2020, the Govt put together a Covid relief package in legislation. At the same time, parties had agreed to only have a token of MPs in Ottawa to vote on legislation due to the pandemic restrictions. It was agreed that partisan politics would be left aside and they did this in good faith.?The Liberal Government [tried to sneak unlimited tax and spend powers](https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.5507499) into the relief package. This would have effectively given their minority government the powers of a majority government. It would have given them the unprecedented ability to tax and spend without a Parliamentary vote, a power that didnt even exist during both World Wars. They had been hoping that they could pass this power as the other parties had reduced members in Parliament at the time. The Opposition caught them on this and they backed down.?2. This is really controversial because over 85% of Canadians polled agree with how the government handled the Trucker Convoy in Ottawa when they invoked the powers of the Emergencies Act to override their Charter Rights.Regardless about opinions, the courts have found that the invocation of the act was unlawful as there was no national emergency present. I would argue that the government unlawfully overriding Charter Rights should have been a far larger scandal than it was.?3. WE Charity. This is a two-parter that is like Canadas Watergate in that the cover-up is greater than the actual crime. Trudeau was cleared of wrongdoings based on the letter of the law, rather than the spirit of the law. He failed to recuse himself in awarding a contract to WE Charity, which had paid his mother and brother for appearances. The Conflict of Interest Act does not include siblings and parents in the definition of immediate family. Morneau was found guilty for the same failure to recuse over his and his daughters links to WE.?Arguably far greater is the cover-up. The Trudeau Government prorogued government on the same day that they had to release documentation on this incident, which they heavily redacted. This shut down two Parliamentary committees that were investigating the scandal, who would have had the powers to remove the redactions. When Parliament resumed, the Liberal and NDP members of those committees filibustered until the Conservatives eventually moved on. ?[Starting at 8:35](https://www.youtube.com/live/WWI_b8xVen0?si=TB-seei2W3iMn1q3) is when Poilievre really got a lot of political clout in a famous presser over this.?4. SNC-Lavalin. The PCO and the PM unlawfully pressured the Attorney General to offer a Deferred Prosecution Agreement to SNC-Lavalin. They also lied about it beforehand and lied about it being the reasoning for the AG being fired a few months later. This would come out to be proven otherwise in a subsequent Ethics Commissioner investigation. The PCO even told the AG that the lack of a DPA would hurt Liberal MPs in Quebec, to which the Prime Minister said: Im a Quebec MP.?The PM disagreed with the findings later on after he was found to have breached the law and has refused to waive privilege for an RCMP investigation to this day.?5.

The Progressive era came about because of the excesses of American industrial capitalism became too much to bear for the average person.

He was not a populist and came to power by exploiting the machinery of an already-established regime.

Conservative/Republican principles essentially demand not to use the power of government for that type of initiative. In other words, if the free market can produce it as a borrowing opportunity for you, then great.  But using government to develop a program would be largely out of bounds.  There may be some appetite for government support, like subsidizing borrowing (like Stafford Loans for education) or connecting borrowers with lendors, but ideally, in their economic view, the more limited the regulation, the more the market determines access to capital. Not right or wrong, necessarily, just a different philosophy.  Personally, I think the answer lies somewhere in betweensomething that protects all parties, and sort of levels the playing field for the free market to provide reasonable opportunity.  Tariffs require delicate understanding of economic conditions and forces between counties, no doubt. They do serve purposes when applied smartly, and probably alittle more succinctly, while specifically targeted.  Full scale, as in 25% on everything from Canada and Mexico, is not an example of smart application of these economic tools.  Some might argue that its just a negotiation starting point, but Im not seeing how that is an effective tactic to use against your two largest trading partners, all things considered.  Anyway, contrary to the popular opinion this week, youre right not all tariffs are inherently bad. But, when supply and demand curves go wonky because of the line of thinking were seeing from Trump, the consumer will be left holding the bill.  So while not necessarily against tariffs myself, Im fully against this particular approach.","title":"Trump vows 25% tariff on imports from Mexico, Canada: What are tariffs?"},{"text":"Steve Bannon is the guy that let the bully shit on him when he was a kid to pretend to be friends with him because it gave him standing. \\"You're gonna be sorry when my friend shows up!!\\"He's a witless moron pussy who is only worth as much as who he clings to with his greasy little hands.How was prison?

But no ones off the table, Homan told The Center Square, raising the possibility that Trump will target families or other undocumented immigrants who have lived and worked for many years in the US.This is an important quote. Trump has repeatedly told stories of immigrants who murdered women, and he talked about drug dealers and human traffickers, and he said \\"migrants will come into your kitchen and slit your throat.\\" (?!) He has repeatedly talked about deportations as if they are focused only on violent people like this. So maybe a lot of Americans believed he was specifically talking about deporting violent people.But as the quote shows, these mass deportations are not just about violent people. If you're not violent or causing any other kind of trouble, you can still be deported. And remember, Trump wants to deport the Haitians in Springfield, even though they came here legally. I think a lot of people are unaware of how bad the mass deportations are going to get.

Money makes it easier as I do not have to have what you want to trade for what you have.The beauty here is that if someone does not want to do a job, the only way you can make them is to pay them enough that they want to. The major issue with capitalism is that one entity can use anti-competitive tactics to try to destroy their competition. This is why unfettered capitalism will never truly work. It must be controlled in a way to prevent the destruction of other companies as a way of doing business. I have yet to see a viable alternative to be put forth. Things like communism only sound good when you only think about what you could get. But without capitalist policies, no communist or socialist society can exit for very long. Those systems by their very nature reduce competition. That remove innovation, price competition, wage competition and advancement. You really have to have someone to compete against in order to advance. Otherwise, there is no incentive to advance.  \\nFurthermore, if you are not paying people for the work that they do, how do you get someone to do jobs that no one wants to do. For example, underwater welding. It is a very dangerous job and requires capital to encourage people to take up that role. If you are not using capitalism to incentivize people to take that role, the only option left is forcing people to do so against their will.","title":"CMV: The fight against Climate Change is over."},{"text":"The fact that those red state voters just voted to completely tank the country and believe the exact opposite of pretty much everything I believe in while living off my tax dollars drives me absolutely bats.

Evidence from observational studies is low quality -  it is confounded and can *not* be used to assess causality only correlation.Main results We included 11 new RCTs and cluster\\\\RCTs (610,872 participants) in this update, bringing the total number of RCTs to 78. Six of the new trials were conducted during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic; two from Mexico, and one each from Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway. We identified four ongoing studies, of which one is completed, but unreported, evaluating masks concurrent with the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.\\nhttps://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub6/fullYou just linked two web pages (which are not studies or reviews incase you are confused, they are webpages) that claim that cloth masks work, which we know from RCTs that they are not effective and one study, which is not a review, but is instead a hopelessly confounded restrospective observational study with 0 citations published in a low impact journal.I'm not trying to sound rude, but you don't seem to know what you're talking about.  Half of what you posted is nonsense.Even your review that you posted contradicts your conclusion.The high risk of bias in the trials, variation in outcome measurement, and relatively low adherence with the interventions during the studies hampers drawing firm conclusions.That does not contradict **the Authors** conclusion (not mine) - it is the basis for their conclusion.  You can not claim an intervention \\"works\\" based on low quality evidence.  In technical terms, the CI based on the totality of all the highest quality randomized evidence we have available is gigantic and the point estimate crosses 0.  If that intervention was then evaluated in accordance with the standards of every other past Cochrane Review, again, the Gold Standard for evaluating medical evidence, what would that mean for the efficacy of the intervention?  Hint: It's not good.  Hint 2:  The HR point estimate for Ivermectin also crosses 0 and has a wide CI.  Do you think Ivermectin works? (It doesn't.)","title":"Trump picks Johns Hopkins surgeon who argued against COVID lockdowns to lead FDA"},{"text":"Yeah she sucks.

Normally I'd say he couldn't, but Musk is threatening to pour his enormous amounts of cash into primarying any Republican who doesn't 100% go along with Trump's agenda.Musk doesn't have much cash. What he does have is a controlling share in a company in the midst of a bubble. And he can't take out many more loans against it on account of it being tied up in Twitter. 2. If Trump implements those tariffs on China, that would be increasing the price on the largest manufacturer of solar to the US by a lot.Tariffs of 25% as proposed will only raise panel costs by 25%, or roughly $0.03/watt. 3. Even if Trump doesn't do anything directly to hurt Renewable Energy, this election seems to have destroyed the morale of environmentalists in America.That's simply untrue. What it has done is hurt their credibility, and they have wisely stepped back to lick their wounds and let the public forget about their open and egregious lies. 4. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, has said he would resist Trump getting rid of renewable energy tax incentives in California. But, he threatened to keep Tesla from Cali's tax incentives, and Tesla makes 55% of all EVs in Cali. If Tesla pulls out of California, that's cutting the sale of EVs in the largest state in half.Tesla would collapse if that happened. They already cant hit production.

Hillsdale also makes the *K-12 at Home* curriculum to groom homeschoolers.NYT - [In Hillsdale College, a Shining City on a Hill for Conservatives](https://archive.is/cbigH)Hillsdale, a private college of 1,400 students in southern Michigan that describes itself as nonsectarian Christian and dedicated to civil and religious liberty, is scarcely known in many circles. But among erudite conservatives  think progeny of William F. Buckley Jr.  it is considered a hidden gem.What they admire is the colleges concentration on the Western philosophical and literary canon (sometimes disparaged as the Great Books of dead white men) and its reverent treatment of the American founding documents as the political culmination of that tradition  a tradition that scholars at Hillsdale say has been desecrated by a century of governmental overreach, including the New Deal and Obamacare.In Washington, Hillsdale plays an active role in an ecosystem of conservative thought and policy. It joined with the Heritage Foundation to run a fellowship program for congressional staff members. Its D.C. outpost, the Allan P. Kirby Jr. Center for Constitutional Studies and Citizenship, runs a lecture series and serves as a base for Hillsdale undergraduates who are interning at conservative think tanks or publications.The soul of Hillsdale is its core curriculum, which largely occupies students for their first two years. It includes more than a dozen mandatory survey courses on topics like the Western heritage (with readings from Hammurabi to Hobbes) and American heritage (the Mayflower Compact to inaugural addresses by Franklin D. Roosevelt and Reagan).Salon - [How this tiny Christian college is driving the rights nationwide war against public schools](https://www.salon.com/2022/03/15/how-this-tiny-christian-college-is-driving-the-rights-nationwide-against-public-schools/)The college has become a leading force in promoting a conservative and overtly Christian reading of American history and the U.S. Constitution. It opposes progressive education reforms in general and contemporary scholarship on inequality in particular. It has featured lectures describing the Jan. 6 insurrection as a hoax and Vladimir Putin as a hero to populist conservatives around the world.But in recent years, Hillsdale has greatly expanded its influence, becoming one of the most significant actors in U.S. conservative politics  if also one of the least conspicuous. Throughout the Trump years, there was a virtual revolving door that shuttled Hillsdale staff and alumni back and forth between the school, the White House and Capitol Hill.Politico - [The College That Wants to Take Over Washington](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/12/hillsdale-college-trump-pence-218362/)[Matthew Spalding, Hillsdale dean,] deflected a question about Trump, and when I asked whether Ryan would retire to Hillsdale, he told me that he was more focused on forming future leaders than appealing to current ones: What Im actually most interested in are the people that will become those people. What Im interested in is whos going to be the Paul Ryan of the future.At this rate, itll be someone whos gone to Hillsdale, I said. Or, they will have been shaped by us in some way, he added, by an online course they took, a classical charter school they attended, or the words of a presidential speech they heard that was penned by a Hillsdale graduate.","title":"Christian nationalists are gearing up to reshape public education in America.

There is no transparent way the score is given or collected &amp; no transparency on who the experts are or their credentials in giving these scores. This score is purely a foreign policy political theatre. Especially considering there are several countries that are more Undemocratic than India, such as Morocco which have a higher V-Dem Human Rights Index score, despite Morocco being an authoritarian monarchy in which the Monarch of Morocco has more power than the Prime Minister of Morocco. The whole rankings may as well be a map of countries that are friendly to Sweden tbh.  Narendra Modi is not an autocrat and he hasnt done any undemocratic measures in his country. And its not even close. Id argue there are more undemocratic measures from the US structural system. And US elections are undemocratic than India. India recently had an election in which Narendra Modi and his party won, but fell short to a majority, but 240/543 seats is still the 3rd best election result the ruling BJP party. Narendra Modis BJP has 44 percent of all the Seats in the Lok Sabha and is only 6 percent of seats away from a majority, and their NDA coalition is enough seats to feel comfortable and rely on for a majority to keep their partys policies passed. Narendra Modis party, the BJP of India controls both houses of Parliament within the Central Government and control most of the regional legislatures of India, which gives them a mandate to rule India, and these elections are conducted by the ECI which is a separate body not directly controlled by the Prime Minister. Narendra Modi or his government did not rig an election and we can see that from the loss of seats in the 2024 General election in India. Narendra Modi &amp; the BJP is less authoritarian than most previous governments. In India theres a mechanism called Presidents Rule which is when the Union Government decides to overhaul a regional government and run the government in the mean time under the President on the decision made by the Prime Minister of India with the approval vote from the Parliament of India. This is usually when a state government is either in a state emergency and they need to be governed by the national government of India, or for more mundane issues, such as a regional government couldnt elect a proper majority to get a new regional government so the national government of India steps in to prevent political instability and runs the region directly instead for the time being. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee BJP government only imposed Presidents rule 5 times, while the Narendra Modi BJP government imposed Presidents rule 7 times.Indira Gandhi, of the Indian National Congress imposed Presidents rule 39 times. The BJP is a lot less authoritarian than the Indian National Congress in India when it comes to domestic policy. Also the political opposition in India is not staunchly pro-US or anti-Russia. The BJP does not have a different foreign policy on Russia compared to the Indian National Congress. And the Congress Party is not like theyre anti-Russia lmao. Rahul Gandhi himself actually SUPPORTS the Modi government on Russia &amp; doesnt want to encourage any aid to Ukraine. https://youtu.be/hehnvhOlYkk?si=d9GkMHuyYIc57W-F https://youtu.be/z53oHkc9SPo?si=OshrBufdfwDdO_XAUnless you think Rahul Gandhi AND Narendra Modi are autocrats, then you basically lost the Indian Left or Indian Right in foreign policy lol. India is a Democracy &amp; Narendra Modi is not authoritarian.

When the SC ruled that the president was immune from presidential acts, not immune from clearly not presidential acts and maybe immune from everything else, without defining what that everything else is, it 100% sealed the fate of getting a Trump conviction.  Any charges filed would have immediately gone to the SC for review and would have taken years and years to resolve.  To any sane person, what Trump did on Jan 6th was neither presidential nor legal, but this SC effectively ruled that all Trump has to do is put some element of doubt in that and he'd be declared as immune.

Here is a [systematic review in the Lancet](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8863502/) reviewing duration of effectiveness of the COVID vaccines from June 17, 2021, to Dec 2, 2021 (you keep talking about Omicron, but Delta is the dominant strain in this period, which is actually the period of interest for \\"mandates\\" as you keep referring to, since Federal mandates started rolling out in September 2021; see [this data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-variants-bar?time=2021-11-22)).As you can see from Table 1, there is a drop in efficacy over time (which is to be expected), **but the vaccines are still broadly effective at preventing infection even after months**. Look at Figure 2: the mRNA vaccines mostly show efficacy of **around 70-80%** in single-variant populations **months after vaccination** (for all ages against any infection).Even in the mixed-variant (more challenging) setting, the vaccines still show 50% efficacy against any infection for all ages.The authors conclude that \\"... most studies showed a notable decrease in vaccine efficacy or effectiveness by 6 months after vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 infection (a decrease of 21 percentage points) and all symptomatic COVID-19 disease (a decrease of 25C32 percentage points).\\", however note where the baseline starts at: a highly effective vaccine. A 20-30pp drop after 6 months of a highly effective vaccine is still good protection against infection.If we jump forward in the timeline to 2022 [another Lancet meta-analysis](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600\\\\(23\\\\)00015-2/fulltext), this time focused on Omicron. From the authors: \\"For infections caused by any SARS-CoV-2 strain, vaccine effectiveness for the primary series reduced from 83% (95% CI 80C86) at baseline (14C42 days) to 62% (53C69) by 112C139 days. Vaccine effectiveness at baseline was 92% (88C94) for hospitalisations and 91% (85C95) for mortality, and reduced to 79% (65C87) at 224C251 days for hospitalisations and 86% (73C93) at 168C195 days for mortality. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was lower for the omicron variant for infections, hospitalisations, and mortality at baseline compared with that of other variants, but subsequent reductions occurred at a similar rate across variants. For booster doses, which covered mostly omicron studies, vaccine effectiveness at baseline was 70% (56C80) against infections and 89% (82C93) against hospitalisations, and reduced to 43% (14C62) against infections and 71% (51C83) against hospitalisations at 112 days or later. Not enough studies were available to report on booster vaccine effectiveness against mortality.\\"Even in the worst case scenario: 40% efficacy against infection at 112 days, **that is still a meaningful amount of protection**. It means that, if we take 1000 people, 500 vaccinated and 500 unvaccinated, and 400 of the unvaccinated get sick, then only 240 of the vaccinated get sick. 160 people will be protected from COVID in that scenario, their antibodies will attack COVID when it enters their system, and they will reduce the spread of COVID to other people.Now, given these facts, does that mean the entire population should have been forced to take the vaccine? Probably not. **Good thing that's not what the US government mandated**. The mandates were for Healthcare workers, Federal employees, and employees of large companies (100 employees) to either vaccinate or mask, again during the *Delta* variant.I think we can all agree it is *not* unethical, given the data and situation in 2021, to mandate healthcare workers be vaccinated against COVID. For Federal employees, I think it is fair to enact vaccine requirements, in 2021. For all other large companies: *maybe* yes, maybe no. This was an unprecedented global pandemic sweeping across the country, and I think it is reasonable for OSHA to consider the occupational hazard of having Bob on the food processing line hacking up his lungs with COVID and infecting his 100 colleagues, in 2021.Now, forward in the timeline in 2022-2023? I think at that point these mandates or restrictions should have been removed, due to changing conditions. **Which is exactly what the Biden administration did in early 2023**.","title":"Trump picks Johns Hopkins surgeon who argued against COVID lockdowns to lead FDA"},{"text":"Based on their ever persistent hypocrisy and worship of a false idol, I'm gonna say no to that.","title":"Somehow, Americans Are Liking Trump Better Every Day"},{"text":"I think most of the differences are explained by massive mail outs and ballot harvesting, most of which was super duper lazy voters, and a smaller bit unknown amount of filing out the ballots of whoever you got mailed the ballot of.

To me, that's as plain a language as the Constitution puts forward. If the House chooses to adjourn, and the Senate doesn't agree to, the President has the power to adjourn them both **indefinitely**.

You can **ask** 250 million for a 1 bedroom shack if you want.  But before the sale can happen, the home has to be appraised.

I'm going to take a historical material take on this as I feel it's important.Under capitalism, hierarchy needs to exist. Most people in this \\"abstraction\\" of an idea think that and even operate by this hierarchy as being omnipresent and unchanging. Someone is at the top and others consequently below them. Before capitalism, this was the monarchy, which they believed they were on top due to the \\"divine right of kings\\" where God put them at the top. But with capitalism, it was based on the \\"divine right of the market.\\" Only the rich get to be placed at the top because otherwise, why would they hold all the outward power if it wasn't deserved. Accross all hierarchy, there is a defined separation of people within it. Anyone who follows a hierarchy demands and can only exist when it is applied, regardless of political, social, religious, or other means. There will always be someone at the top, and it must be placed there by people who are deserving of that power. If there exists a system in which it needs the function of separation to exist, then there is a root \\"us vs. them\\" that Mandates this hierarchy. Even in a monarchy, there is a separation of status and importance. Who stands above everyone? The king, a man. The root \\"us vs. them\\" is placed between man and woman. Even if you're royalty, you are still subservient to your husband. The hierarchy still fractions based on your own place within it, and men as a whole have not had a coming of age yet. Women had their defiance of this hierarchy with their feminist movements. It was a chance for them to look separately from the status quo of having a hierarchy and look at themselves and defy it. But there has been an ongoing material reality persisting since the industrial revolution, and that is capitalism.It needs to have a hierarchy in order to persist. You can not be a capitalist without others to steal surplus labor from. It will not continue without it. So there needs to be a separation of who controls what and is placed above others. Historically speaking had been men. It transcends even race. Wherever you go, it's men vs. women. Sure, women can be capitalists, but the idea still remains, men are on top, and women are not. It is convenient to gain power, it's much harder to release it. Every time we've had a crisis of capitalism, fascism has taken hold, not because it's destined to do so, but people weponize men alienation within the system and instead of fighting against it they side with it because capital, with all its influence demands when push comes shove, that we will side with our power and influence. Men are never told an alternative because doing so is fundamentally against the idea of a hierarchy. Even women who are conservative believe in it, that they are below the men in their life. Men go running to traditional masculinity in times of economic crisis, because it takes a lot of effort to challenge a social and historical and material idea of hierarchy than it is to just passively accept it. Men have to provide this alternative that what's ailing them in this post-industrial world *is* the same system defining themselves to it and not the freedom itself that others have fought for. The same things are happening over and over again and will happen again until it doesn't.Edit: And that's just the identifying part.

They *don't want* a healthy economy.  They want to destroy it so the rich can buy up everything for cheap, squeeze the populus for every last penny they have, and make them work for them for nothing.  Look at COVID and the absolute lack of any real stimulus beyond the single check that people had to fight to get.  Other countries understood that providing a stimulus to the population whom were out of work from COVID would help keep the economy afloat, they instead chose to ignore that and tank the economy by refusing to provide anything and coerce the public to return to work in shit jobs for pennies.  Universal, affordable health insurance would save money for millions as they could then spend the money that one *might* have for medical emergencies, as well as whatever they spend on insurance, in other aspects of the economy.  But they won't do that so they can instead keep shoveling money to insurance agencies and for-profit health systems.  Increasing the minimum wage gives the working class more money to be able to actually spend on things, but they won't do that because it's easier for companies like Walmart to pay pennies, limit hours to avoid benefits, and force their staff to enroll in government programs like Food Stamps that the same companies help collect.  They **KNOW** all of these things, hence why Republicans refuse to actual do them and demonize them so their base keeps voting them in.  Because they actively do not want them coming through so that they can help the rich get even richer.  Of course, there's also a breaking point that they actively ignore, which we've in fact seen.  The previously mentioned lack of stimulus didn't work as people refused to return to low paying positions during COVID and resulted in a number of businesses tanking or outright closing because, shockingly, when people can't afford things during a pandemic they aren't going to spend on it.  American's quality of health in general is horrible compared to much of the rest of the world, because people flat out refuse to visit a doctor when they should due to cost, only going in an absolute emergency (which in turn also impacts productivity as a unhealthy workforce is less productive than a healthy one).  As previously mentioned people got fed up from constant low wages, especially as it was made worse during COVID, and we have long seen industries and businesses suffer as a result, with, again, COVID providing even more impact or an outright kick over the edge as people tightened their wallets.  Many of course attempted to rectify it by increasing prices and reducing quantity or quality while blaming \\"inflation\\", but there are still large companies still feeling the shocks because it's just a bandage fix to a problem they created and had backfire on them.  As for it backfiring even more, frankly with the 2024 election showing how absolutely moronic and gullible a large portion of the population is, even outside the cult of Trump crowd, it's not going to backfire the way you think.  There will be many buying into it being anything else than the people they helped prop up and will eagerly take the crumbs they give and think nothing else.  Those who know and will say better will either be ignored or silenced.","title":"Trump team eyes quick rollback of Biden student debt relief"},{"text":"Where theres a puree theres a way","title":"Trump Announces Plan To Deport 5,000 Illegal Immigrants In One Pre-Owned Honda Civic Hatchback | Now That's Thinking Green??"},{"text":"I offered you my seed!!!","title":"Trump Has Late-Night Meltdown Over New York Times Story on Close Aide - Donald Trump is fuming after a New York Times story on his relationship with Natalie Harp, his 33-year-old personal aide."},{"text":"Remember when an affair with an aide would end your political career?\\n...the fuck happened?","title":"Trump Has Late-Night Meltdown Over New York Times Story on Close Aide - Donald Trump is fuming after a New York Times story on his relationship with Natalie Harp, his 33-year-old personal aide."},{"text":"Yeah, I think it's certainly fair to admire Chong for that.

Back in the 1990s and even into the early 2000s you could criticize the president freely, including on live TV, and nothing would happen to you. In fact, that happened every day. The FSB chief was on live TV answering pointed questions, media was diverse and independent (though oligarchic), the courts were independent, regional governments were independent, there were no state monopolies like the future Gazprom, Rosneft, Rostec, etc. Russia's democracy was problematic, sure, and elections were often unfair (but free), but otherwise the Russian state barely controlled anything outside of its devolved powers. Russia's all-time high democracy score being almost as good as India's current one is very much in keeping with reality and the developments.Those seeds of a true liberal democracy were then destroyed by Putin, much like they have been recently by Modi. Currently, India is heading more the way of Turkey, where a strong civil society has been able to push back against the state apparatus, but it could still swing the way of Russia, and I hope to goodness it doesn't. I want a prosperous and free India by the people, not by one person.I find V-Dem, which averages out the scores of many political and historian experts for every year, and the way they clearly show a limited, but visible recent democratic backsliding in many, though not all Western countries, very much in keeping with reality. They also frequently show during some years improvements in countries that aren't very democratic.

Many of these applications have been in review since not only the Trump admin, but some were as old as the *Obama* admin. Biden was the first president to put a real concerted effort behind outstanding applications. Trump is basically saying hes going to come in and disrupt the forgiveness occurring now, which is by and large for civil servants who have met the requirements of the PSLF. Not only that - he is stating he will *reverse* the actions taken by Biden to forgive public servants, reinstating their debts.There are going to be at least a few surprised pikachus in the government who voted for this moron while waiting on their PSLF to go through or who even had it forgiven already.","title":"Trump team eyes quick rollback of Biden student debt relief"},{"text":"OP it sounds like you had a great argument based on facts and reason and your opponent had nothing but hatred and misinformation.Its hard arguing with people who are willfully ignorant.

Most of those who have emulated him have failed to triumph (i.e. Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy in their runs for president, and Kari Lake, Herschel Walker, Mehmet Oz, etc. in their runs for the Senate, and Doug Mastriano and Mark Robinson in their runs for governor).Two weeks ago, I talked about how Mao's cult in China died out because his potential successors were eventually sidelined in the Communist Party.This time I will talk about Stalin's cult and how it died out.Like Trump, Stalin's cult was based on fear of persecution of those who opposed him. After his death, possible successors to continue the cult emerged like Leonid Brezhnev, Nikita Khrushchev, Lavrenity Beria, Georgy Malenkov, and Nikolai Bulganin. However, all lacked the strength and charisma to continue it. The Communist Party also went into big infighting over what the path forward should be. Khrushchev eventually denounced Stalin and his cult some time later and began to de-Stalinize the Soviet Union.Vance likely lacks the power to continue MAGA, and when the day comes that Trump is gone, we will inevitably see huge fighting within the Republican Party between McCain and Romney-like Republicans and the more right-wing factions of the party.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 26, 2024"},{"text":"Then you're gonna taking political L's for the rest of your life since the basic idea of political strategy seems to be beyond your galaxy brain lol","title":"Only a Working-Class Party Can Challenge Donald Trumps Corruption"},{"text":"FTA:At publishing time, Trump had also announced that he would impose tariffs on Canada, but only for maple syrup because no one really cares about anything else coming out of Canada.canada catching strays!","title":"Trump Proposes 25 Percent Tariff On Imports From California"},{"text":"\\"Decades\\"\\nTry the rest of the century","title":"Take Trumps Threats of U.S. Military Action in Mexico Seriously"},{"text":"My guy in what world have you managed to convince people you were right by first saying they were stupid Forget politics, in your personal life, would you ever tell someone theyre doing something wrong by opening with youre stupid, thats not how to do itThis is so basic that I feel like there are serious socialization problems at root here","title":"Only a Working-Class Party Can Challenge Donald Trumps Corruption"},{"text":"The media is anti-normalcy.Insanity sells. ?","title":"Trump tied migrant entries and fentanyl to tariffs.

I get the idea of \\"the US should produce what it's citizens need/want,\\" but that isn't happening or even close to happening.Nowhere in the tariff definition does it state that the country who has the tariff imposed on them will pay the additional cost to export their items.

And in the end, 10 or 20 years later, we would end up with a Mexican government that is even less effective than the current one.","title":"Take Trumps Threats of U.S. Military Action in Mexico Seriously"},{"text":"I wish we had Trump instead of Trudeau ??","title":"BREAKING: Trudeau Folds to Trumps Tariff Demands in Under 24 Hours C He Has the Face of a Beaten Man (Video)"},{"text":"He is picking people that make him look smart by comparison.

This is Trumps last term and then the persona and the cult following goes away. Republicans do not have a campaign, they have a persona and the persona is done. Whoever they put up for election after this will absolutely have zero chance of winning. Think about it - what does Donald Trump do when he isnt getting attention, when he isnt the star? Tantrums. He will not hand over the crown to whomever the RNC chooses as their next candidate for 2028. He will run a smear campaign against them and maybe toss them a bone at the last minute, but Donald Trump will absolutely not step to the side over the next four years while Republicans try to nominate another candidate. Republicans will not be able to campaign successfully for the presidency while Trump is there - he is very fragile and emotional. He will not standby while someone else gets all of the glory for almost two years! Every time they try to campaign, Trump will shit, fart, and burp at the same time to grab the media attention back on himself. Trump is also an anomaly. He is persona. You will not find anyone else with that persona. That cannot be handed off or given away. Republicans already barely win elections with Trumps personality carrying the entire weight over their vastly unpopular beliefs. Republicans have not received more than 50% of the popular vote since 2004 and after this goon tanks everything, robs the bank, and leaves a big mess - we are going straight into a back to back term with Democrat presidents.

Meanwhile, we need to economically choke the deadbeat red states while creating barriers to entry to keep them from easily relocating to more prosperous blue states. Once they've had a chance to implode, we can move in state government by state government and rebuild their educational institutions one at a time. It's going to take a lifetime to fix the damage MAGA and the GOP have done to education. In the meantime, the working class in redstates are the enemy and we need to stop trying to appease or attract them. Let them have the hellscape they voted for. We need to focus on creating a firewall against their stupidity while we wait on them to collapse.EDIT: Stop @ing me about Democrats. I'm a libertarian.

Our ability to police foreign interference in the Americas is heavily contingent on our raw dominance of the region.This is why stuff like the Cuban missile crisis was a big deal; it was Russia directly pissing on what has behind closed doors, been seen as our front lawn for centuries. Not saying that is the right way for the US to conduct geopolitics, just saying it is how it has done so.In any case, America couldn't have afforded to leave the South to its own devices; it would have opened the South inevitably to being swallowed up by strong European powers; and its not a coincidence that the Union was spending a lot of resources building a massive coastal navy during the civil war, it wasn't just for the confederates.

Also, I might be misunderstanding your last paragraph, but mens lib is not MGTOW. Theyre a pro-feminist mens advocacy group. Pretty much all of the mens groups have their origins from around the time feminisms 2nd wave was picking up. They then branched off into 2 groups, a pro feminism mens advocacy group (mens lib), and an anti-feminism mens advocacy group. The anti-feminism group evolved into mens rights groups, which then branched off into all of these other groups (including MGTOW, PUA, incels, etc) and kinda became the manosphere. So mens lib is going the complete opposite direction as MGTOW. It recognizes that the patriarchy is not only harmful to women, but also to men, and that a lot of these issues manosphere groups are complaining about stem from it. With that said, their solutions to these problems lie in gender equality, which actually makes sense. Unlike manosphere groups that complain about issues caused by the patriarchy then propose essentially doubling down on the patriarchy to solve them somehow. So basically: if youre looking for a solid mens advocacy group that doesnt exist to hate on women, Mens Lib is the one youre looking for. If youre looking for examples of MGTOW, I believe theres a sub for it, but you can also find a ton of MGTOW men on twitter.","title":"CMV: The 4B Movement and MGTOW are basically the same and both should be treated the same"},{"text":"Puritanism working as the landed gentry intended","title":"Trump team eyes quick rollback of Biden student debt relief"},{"text":"It's like a family member stabbing you in the heart after talking for ten years about how they want to stab you in the heart.","title":"Ford says Trump's tariff threat 'like a family member stabbing you in the heart'"},{"text":"There is a very good reason I have two of the most common posters on the Canada ping blocked.

It is a separate and unrelated government agency that annoyingly happens to have the same name.The OSC are [these guys](https://osc.gov/Agency) they are an investigative agency that handles whistleblowing hatch act violations and deal with Service Member re-employment for some reason. Their current senate approved head is [Hampton Dellinger](https://osc.gov/Pages/Leadership.aspx). Going back and looking at the law, it is clearly talking about the Office of Special Counsel (The government agency) not the Special Counsel (ie. Muller).So to summarize:THE LINK YOU PROVIDED IS TALKING ABOUT A COMPLETELY UNRELATED AGENCY. Also, to answer your question despite the fact that it is now moot, [James C McKay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_C._McKay). He was appointed in 1987 (by the US Court of appeals oddly enough, not even the DOJ, let alone congress) to investigate the Wedtech scandal.

Many of the products that are US products rely on foreign raw materials.  So, when those tariffs are put into place, the price of the end US product will also increase.  So, the leveling of the playing field the US company may have received from tariffs is now gone.2. Many companies are a part of a supply chain and have contracts.  So, they have contracted with a Mexican supplier for the materials needed to make their part that will then go to a higher tiered company making the final end product.  For instance, a Mexican company provides steel to a torque conveter company who provides the torque converter to Ford.  The US torque converter company likely has contracts with both to provide so much product for a certain time period at a certain price.  They can't source elsewhere or they risk breaking a contract.  However, the US torque converter now has to pay a 25 percent tax on the steel they buy.  Yet, they can't pass that price on to Ford without Ford agreeing to it.  If Ford doesn't agree, they are now making 25 percent less.  Given the competitiveness of a market like that, they may now be making little to no profit.  So, a US based company is now harmed by these tariffs and US workers will lose jobs.  If the US torque converter company is lucky, Ford will agree to pay the increased tariff and will raise the price of the vehicle to offset it, but that means the US consumer is still paying more.3. Even companies that source wholly within the US are likely to do market research to determine whether they will make more money off of increased demand or off of raising prices.  They also have to determine whether they have capacity to meet increased demand.  What is most likely IMO is that they company decides to raise their price to capture the best of both worlds.  Increase some demand by having a price a bit more competitive with foreign suppliers, but also increase price leading to higher profit margins.  That is great and all for the US company to have better profit margins, but it also means that the US consumer is paying more for the good regardless of the place of origin.  Is it likely that the worker gets a wage increase that helps to offset the increased cost of goods?  No.  That would cut into that profit margin for the US business.","title":"Trump's proposed tariff increases would boost inflation by nearly 1%, Goldman Sachs estimates"},{"text":"Gotta love the hair on fire over in r / Politics - We run a $153B trade deficit with Mexico and a $67B trade deficit with Canada.","title":"Mexico hints at retaliatory tariffs in response to Trump threats - Washington Examiner"},{"text":"It would depend on if the public felt the cartel is the problem or the current administration.
