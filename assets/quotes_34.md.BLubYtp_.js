Which as I Christian myself is a major problem that each has.When in actuality each of those religions tells their practitioners to \\"Treat other as you wish to be treated\\" or to quote the meme: \\"Jesus said love one another; he did not say love one another unless...\\"I could sit here and quote scriptures at you all day that prove my point, and  you could find ones that prove yours. The issue with both is context, I did not use a specific scripture with my examples rather the point  of several lessons for this reason. there is only one verse I regularly quote: Psalms 118-8 \\"It is better to trust in God than to put faith in man\\" There are 1,188 verses before it and 1,188 verse after it. this has been proven I found this fact to be encouraging.I also think it is pretty cool that, that verse is at the exact center of the Bible.But back to the point,The  God of the religions of Abraham is a deity of love, compassion forgiveness and understanding. I have felt for a very long time that all of the hate committed in it's name is anthesis to it. The issue is not the philosophies it is the humans practicing  the philosophies feeling morally superior and acting  morally superior and then treating any one not following \\"the way\\" with contempt; which is in fact something they are taught NOT to do at a young age. But then we grow and watch our elders and teachers all have an attitude of \\"I am right and you are a idiot\\", Which 90% of humans over the age of 15 have whether they are willing to admit it or not and 100% of humans have this attitude for quite some time before realize what they are doing and how they are treating people. At some point we all act this way toward at least one person or group. More is the pity.So this is what I feel is the issue most people have with religion, it is not the actual religious philosophy, in most cases looking at that you can find  things  you actually agree with, not everything but somethings.

On one hand, you're saying that Israel has engaged in a campaign of ethnic cleansing and discrimination against the Palestinians for decades. On the other hand, you're saying that the response to a single terror attack would \\"expose\\" Israel's \\"psychopathic mindset\\".How can one reasonably believe that *this specific terror attack* would suddenly reveal barbarity more severe than 70+ years of, as you've described it, genocide?You've asserted that Hamas *knew* that this would be the response, but I don't think that's true. I think that Hamas expected the same response they've received each time they've escalated hostilities with Israel since taking power nearly 20 years ago. Hamas clearly underestimated Israel's response. Strategically, this war has been a disaster for them:? Several of their leaders have been killed, they've been kicked out of Doha, and the organization is operationally in tatters? Gaza is in ruins? Their ally Hezbollah has been devastated by Israeli attacks and has had to force a separate peace? Hundreds of thousands (if not over a million) more Palestinians now find themselves in refugee camps, their homes destroyed. ? Israel has greater control over both Gaza and the West bank? Iranian proxies (and Iran itself) have all suffered losses in this conflict. If Hamas knew how crushing the Israeli response would be, but did so anyway in the interests of PR, October 7th would have been one of the greatest strategic blunders of all time.","title":"CMV: As a Pro-Palestine supporter, what happened on October 7 was in fact a terrorist attack--one that was used to draw out Israel to revealing their barbarity."},{"text":"\\"I murdered your babies to prove you were a bad mother.\\"-You","title":"CMV: As a Pro-Palestine supporter, what happened on October 7 was in fact a terrorist attack--one that was used to draw out Israel to revealing their barbarity."},{"text":"Why does fox even give Bernie a platform?

A distinction needs to be made between the Israeli right, who I despise, and the Israeli left and centre. I also believe that people really misinterpret what Zionism is, it was initially to establish a Jewish state and now there is one Zionism (by its recognised definition) is the maintaining of the Jewish state, which also means by definition Anti-Zionist are anti-Semitic.

Some of them are **completely fucking fake**. On Judaism, specifically, to be holy means to be, as the text explains, to be chosento be a people for his treasured possession.This possession is the commandments, ie the rules and Torah and laws. Jews are commanded to follow more rules which do not apply to non-Jews. This does not make Jews better, it makes them the nation chosen to follow laws that Jewish tradition teaches make a person happier **while alive**. The idea is that they lead to a better life, not to salvation or superiority in a moral sense. You are misreading the intent behind the words as well as some of the interpretations of text itself. Deuteronomy 7:6 is in the context of other nations; Jews are commanded not to stray from the teachings of God and worship idols, not because they are better, but because they should remain faithful to the laws they (and not non-Jews) must follow to maintain the covenant signed with God for a bountiful life.Bava Kama 113a does not say this. It is really problematic to see upvotes and awards for fake quotes about Judaism. It does not say that if a Jew finds an object lost by a gentile (heathen) then it doesnt have to be returned. At all. There is no claim as such there. And anyone familiar with the Talmud can explain quite clearly that said Talmud section is actually a debate where the side that says you cannot steal from gentiles or dishonestly favor Jews over them in legal matters, nor is it allowed to rob a gentile (paraphrasing).The same is true of Avodah Zara 26b. This is an old claim that does not exist. It does not say anything about killing gentiles. It is fake. This quote is likely derived from internet neo-Nazis who made it up, and it persists. The closest you get is something from an entirely different book of the Talmud, Sofrim 15:10, which says to kill the best of the heathens **in time of war**, and is referring to the fact that even at war, you should kill the enemy, even if they are honorable and moral people, because they are still at war. It does not say kill all gentiles or anything close.Go to the source documents.

What's the point of comparing? ancient religions on hypothetical ethical claims about the afterlife. Within each religious tradition there will be many different versions of the afterlife anyway all with different ethics.?For example in 19th century Britain there existed people called sin-eaters who ate a ritual meal to take on people's sins so others could go to heaven and dooming them to hell. In the middle ages those who died fighting in the Crusades were given heaven as a reward for their martyrdom. Many people today believe that those favored gain material wealth as a reward for their piety. These are all quite radically different from your model. To me at least they seem worse.?\\nHinduism and Buddhism is also hyperdiverse and in actual practice I'm not sure the differences are as extreme as the theology might seem to imply. At some level what matters is what's on the ground, the reality of what people are doing day to day and year to year. Examining the ethics of a hypothetical model of the afterlife becomes too abstract and becomes an argument of definitions across languages.

Ive found very few exceptions to this in people regarding politically charged, nuanced topics. You seem very confident in your assessment of what exactly is happening in this conflict, but many experts strongly disagree. Take for example your conviction that Israel is committing genocide. The 1948 UN Genocide Convention defines genocide as acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. These acts include:\\n * Killing members of the group\\n * Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group\\n * Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part\\n * Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group\\n * Forcibly transferring children of the group to another groupA key element of the definition is intent to destroy. This means that it is not enough for a group to suffer harm; there must be evidence that the perpetrator intended to destroy the groups existence. Proving intent can be challenging, as it requires demonstrating the motivation behind the actions. The high number of Palestinian causalities is the strongest argument for genocide, along with the broader conflict spanning decades. But its not a very strong one, and in my opinion a lot of arguments dismantle the strict definition. A few of them are; Israels stated mission are military operations aimed at stopping rocket attacks and dismantling Hamass military infrastructure, not at destroying the Palestinian population.\\n * Israel argues that it takes precautions to minimize civilian harm, such as providing warnings before attacks and using precision weaponry.\\n * Hamass use of human shields: The argument that Hamas operates within civilian areas, using civilians as human shields, making it difficult to avoid civilian casualties.\\n * Lack of clear evidence of intent: It can be argued that there is no clear evidence that Israels goal is to destroy the Palestinian people as a group.\\n* You also mentioned the historical actions that help categorize this as genocide, this is hard to square away with the population actually increasing in size until this war broke out. Most accusations of genocide, in my personal opinion, are politically charged and using looser definitions in order to gain sympathy for the Palestinian cause.","title":"CMV: As a Pro-Palestine supporter, what happened on October 7 was in fact a terrorist attack--one that was used to draw out Israel to revealing their barbarity."},{"text":"Thats the Catholic views as well then.It has to be a wilful act of rejecting Christ, ignorant people are not at fault.

States can use the 10th Amendment to nullify federal laws in their jurisdictions, and a few have already done a little of that, but since the federal government uses grant money (which comes from the state's tax payers!) as a carrot/stick type of bribe to keep states in line it becomes very difficult to get popular support for it even locally. People in states still would have to pay heavy federal taxes, so the money can't simply be shifted to pay for the state's loss of grant money. It would help a great deal if the federal income tax could be abolished and replaced with nothing. This would give voters in states more independence to nullify federal laws because they would have more money to pay for their own state's infrastructure rather than having to rely on grants.

A lot of the lessons I learned from my psychedelic phase were simple things like Don't commit to a woman you don't really want to marry, don't stay at a job that causes you anguish, take care of your body by fasting and exercising, don't watch porn or masturbate, spend more time in nature, etc.There is a higher chance of damaging yourself via drugs than there is having an epiphanic transformation.  I got lucky, most people I know who take psychedelics did not.  You don't need psychedelics to expand your consciousness and develop your spirit.  Drugs don't give you these experiences, they just hardwire your brain to force them to play like a torrented movie.  You can expand your consciousness and develop your spirit without drugs.  What's better is when you do it without drugs, it's infinite and more pure.  All the experiences and feelings drugs gave me are still there in my consciousness, it's just a matter of learning how to live a spiritual life and tuning in to them.  You can have all the bliss and spiritual epiphany that drugs MAY give you, but without any risks of side effects.  It's much easier to just take drugs and get a glimpse of this way of living, but you only get a small taste.  It's better to walk the path without them.","title":"Does anyone else think that aliens are really demons?"},{"text":"I'm reminded of the Robert Eggers movie *The Northman*, in which one Viking expresses his distrust of christians by saying [\\"Their god is a corpse nailed to a tree.\\"](https://www.getyarn.io/yarn-clip/f8ec8b81-bd3c-4bb5-8d7d-75ff6c2b2558)","title":"Biden, Harris Offer Greetings for Controversial Kwanzaa"},{"text":"\\"I murdered your kid in the most horrible way possible to prove that you are an asshole.\\" WAAAAHHH!","title":"CMV: As a Pro-Palestine supporter, what happened on October 7 was in fact a terrorist attack--one that was used to draw out Israel to revealing their barbarity."},{"text":"Let's not move the goalposts on the definition of genocide.

The solution involves a bottom up approach of getting voters to understand the appeal of progressive policies and *then* you can begin to run progressive candidates with a hope of winning elections.

For example, a significant part of the Jewish Torah details the process of sacrifices and, practically nowhere, details the organization of the Jewish liturgy, yet, Jews have not made sacrifices for nearly 2000 years and Jews have had a fixed liturgy for nearly 500 years. Religious beliefs and actions are the philosophical and behavioral superstructure for which holy texts are only one part of the foundation. Some of the other comments address these philosophical changes over time.When it comes to the philosophy concerning the treatment of other religions, these were philosophies that developed over time and through interaction with peoples of other faiths. But let's go through the particular citations you raise and point out why the mainstream beliefs within those categories don't follow the logic here from a purely textual analysis:Deut. 7:6/14:2 -- This concept of \\"chosenness\\" falls into the Jewish perception which I mentioned in the beginning, that Jews have a specific mission or purpose which is different from those of Gentiles. Different does not mean superior. Most Jews would phrase it in the way that engineers and lawyers are different and contribute meaningfully in different ways, but it would be absurd to claim that one was superior, even if we care more about what lawyers do on the express question of \\"what is legal?\\" as opposed to caring more about engineers on the express question of \\"what is possible.\\"Talmud, Bava Kamma 113a: -- The wording you provide is different from the wording in the relevant section, which concerns making change through exchanges with certain kinds of tax collectors' bursar (as opposed to their personal funds, which can be exchanged to make change). From Sefaria, a Jewish website that hosts Jewish religious texts:\\"One may not exchange larger coins for smaller ones from the trunk of customs collectors nor from the purse of tax collectors, and one may not take charity from them, as they are assumed to have obtained their funds illegally. But one may take money from the collectors house or from money he has with him in the market that he did not take from his collection trunk or purse.\\"Talmud, Abodah Zarah 26b -- This is a rather complex argument as discussed in detail at the link below, but to keep it as simple as possible, the context for the remark is with respect to enemy combatants (who may have been upstanding men) specifically in the case of the Egyptians pursuing the Israelites at the Red Sea. The Talmud has other lines in it which are opposed to the killing of Gentiles and the Talmud also respects that the Non-Jewish, dominant law of a country (which will almost always criminalize the killing of Gentiles) should apply whenever no Jewish law expressly contradicts it. So, this verse is out of context and not generally applicable.[http://talmud.faithweb.com/articles/kill.html](http://talmud.faithweb.com/articles/kill.html)Christianity:John 14:6 (New Testament)/Acts 4:12 (New Testament): -- This is a restatement of the belief that I wrote in my first comment to you, which is that only through the Sacrifice Upon the Cross can a person who is aware of the Sacrifice Upon the Cross achieve salvation. However, those who have not heard of the Sacrifice Upon the Cross are not required to have heard it to achieve salvation. As Romans 10:14 says, \\"How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?\\"Matthew 7:21-23 (New Testament): -- This actually proves the point that I made in the first comment, which is that being a Christian without a true understanding of the Sacrifice Upon the Cross is insufficient to achieve salvation. A person's belonging to the category of being Christian (and even performing wonders) does not substitute for the acceptance of divine grace that is necessary.Islam:Surah 3:85 (Quran): -- One of the fundamental issues with interpreting the Qur'an is that the Qur'an has many contradictory verses that are very context-dependent. You have cited a verse that is contradicted by Q: 2:256 and the verse that I indirectly cited in my previous comment Q: 2:62. Q: 2:62 in particular assures salvation for the Jews, Christians, and Sabeans (as I mentioned). Additionally, we should note that the Qur'an often equivocates with the word \\"Islam\\" between two different concepts: (1) the religion expressed by Muhammad and the Qur'an with five pillars and (2) the idea of monotheism in the Abrahamic tradition more generally. (This is why Muslims will say that Abraham, Moses, and Jesus were all Muslims despite not following the teachings of the Qur'an and Muhammad.) Q: 3:85, especially when given the context of verses Q: 3:81-85 looks much closer to definition (2).You've noted that Q: 2:62 is an arbitrary exclusion and I would push back on the arbitrariness (it is based on the concept that these are all Islam under definition (2)) but there is an exclusivity. All religions teach that certain people will not achieve salvation and the issue that Islam raises here is that salvation comes through certain behaviors and interactions with the world which older incarnations of Islam under definition (2) have, which brings them into the fold. When Muslims had more interaction with Zoroastrians (who have a different monotheistic or henotheistic tradition), Zoroastrians were often added as another accepted group. There were also occasions (although it was religiously contentious) by Muslim Mughal leaders in India to add Hindus to this group because Hindus also appeared to be moral and, therefore, touched with the same Islam under definition (2) as the other monotheistic faiths. So, it's not as exclusive as at first blush and the exclusion isn't arbitrary, it's based on moral character.Surah 4:56 (Quran): -- This verse isn't great, but it doesn't negate Q: 2:62 -- since those worshippers would still not be denying God's signs.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Please use the technically correct term sparkling humanitarian disaster","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I personally can't really relate, the closest for me is when I'm in a mood to mess around and not take things seriously while out with friends, but it is definitely possible.

If they are really from god, well, god doesn't really need to care what you (or really anyone else) think of him, because he is all powerful and stuff. You need to care what he think is moral, because well, he is all powerful and you are not (presumably). It isn't very fair, but supreme power comes with perks.I don't know if that tracks. I've never thought that \\"what God says is right is right because he's all powerful\\" is really a good justification for what is *actually* right.Think about it this way: A dictator comes to power in a country, and tries to get something completely eradicated within that country. (whatever the thing is doesn't matter, maybe say phones for instance.) If you're seen with a phone, it's taken away from you and destroyed. Protest the destruction of phones and this dictator will have you killed. He preaches that phones are the source of everything wrong in society and that destroying them and any people who use them is perfectly morally acceptable. Even though this hypothetical dictator is stronger than us, and has incredible power over our lives, that has absolutely nothing to do with the genuine righteousness of what he's doing.Now assume that this dictator, for all intents and purposes, has basically infinite power. He can snap his fingers and reshape the world in an instant. He doesn't need any military to support him, since no weapon can kill him. In this incredibly powerful state, his hatred for phones still isn't any more morally justified, but his ability to impose those morals on other people is.Maybe no one will speak up against him, for fear of being killed... But that still doesn't make his actions and opinions right.Like, if I decided to beat up someone who's weaker than me because they're doing something I don't agree with, that doesn't make my opinion any better or worse than his. That just makes me an asshole who can't accept people thinking differently without wanting them harmed.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"For Christianity, at least, you have the basic principle right, sorta.  But what you've missed is that salvation is explicitly *not* based on morality (or rather, it is expected that morality follows salvation).Because no one is sufficiently moral to be saved, God condescends to us and grants us the opportunity to be saved despite our inadequacy, merely by following Him.  Salvation is given by God for His own reasons.  This is exemplified in both the thief on the cross (who was promised salvation literally as he was dying, absent any good works) and the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard (Matthew 20:1-16): \\"Dont I have the right to do what I want with my own [salvation]? Or are you envious because I am generous?\\"So yes, salvation is unjust.  But Christian doctrine is that it is not *salvation* which is just, but *damnation* - we all deserve to be punished and God will punish us fairly, except that He has chosen to show mercy to some simply because it is His will.I don't expect this to change your mind, because I don't think most people look for justice unless it indemnifies them, because people generally don't judge themselves to be bad people.On the other hand, though, I find that Eastern religions don't satisfy my sense of justice at all.  For example, I would desire reincarnation (because life is generally desirable), and the idea that only the best people do not receive it seems grotesque.  The idea that people cannot in one lifetime 'recover' from a misspent youth is bleak and hopeless.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"It's only weird if you don't handle it gracefully, but you did.","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Youve got to realize this reads like cope","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Jen Psaki has spent her career as a mouthpiece for shitty policy, this is just MSNBC throwing their audience a bone, because the decision's been made.","title":"Jen Psaki scolds Democrats for snubbing young, media-savvy AOC from key committee post"},{"text":"I still cant comprehend how expensive cars have gotten since Covid.

I have never heard of either. A google search only turns up references to extreme anti-Semitic and conspiracy type sites. They rely on people being too lazy or ignorant to actually read the Talmud, and in further not understanding what the Talmud actually is.The Talmud is in places a record of various Rabbinical debates over the correct interpretation of the minutiae  of Jewish law. It is not the case that everything written in the Talmud is a binding statement of Jewish law: its a record of *debates*, in which one Rabbi writes one thing, another contradicts him, and a third says why both the other two are wrong. So it is easy for the ignorant or ill-intentioned to take something said by a rabbi out of context, and claim Jews believe X when they believe no such thing.That said, I checked out your first quote, and it appears straight up invented. Here is the part cited, available online in translation: https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.26b?lang=biNothing there I could see remotely resembling the alleged quote. I havent bothered to look up the other one.Edit: just because Im bored, I also looked up the second cite. It may be found here:https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.113a.21?lang=biThe concept shows up - but in the context of a debate proving the exact opposite point. The commentary expressly states, after multiple debates using various tactics (what if a Jewish slave is attempting to escape?) with an absolute pronouncement: it is not permitted to rob or deceive non-Jews, because to do so would desecrate Gods name; and ultimately the law of the kingdom is the law, meaning Jews are obliged to follow local civil laws. With regard to items lost by gentiles, there is a whole debate, but the ultimate conclusion appears to be that  (a) it is prohibited to steal from gentiles, and (b) it is prohibited to retain an item lost by a gentile that comes into ones hands, as retention of an article lost by a gentile would result in the desecration of Gods name. It is actually worth the time to read this section (in small part - the Talmud goes on and on) just because it shows how this ancient form of Jewish law-making works  and how easy it is for haters to take a section from a debate out of context. The debate here involves various rabbis making arguments - why cant Jews manipulate the law to take advantage of non-Jews? - only to have these arguments shot down.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Yes but I know Im egging them on a little when I laugh at it, they love the attention","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Thinking about starting a rating service that rates bond credit rating services so I can be like \\"Moody's? bollocksed,\\" \\"Fitch? totally fukkin fried,\\" \\"Standard &amp; Poor? gimpass company tbh\\"","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Holy mother of God how is this hot chicken MEDIUM I am dying","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Avro Vulcan, but tbh they werent produced enough to be a common freighter","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/o6nav55h7j9e1.jpeg?width=714&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a565f67a731f66992f973a09a82e1446f252fa6e","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/9jhy1wfd7j9e1.jpeg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=311d70a13fa9785b3b544c2d7cbc6b0e4abf4dc5Something like this but heavily modified to have ball turrets","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Callaway certified pre-owned wont turn you down.

If theres no way to verify that these rules come directly from a divine source, then theyre just human interpretations of what they think God would want. And if those interpretations are wrong, then the whole system falls apart.You also have to consider the fact that power doesnt inherently equal morality. Just because God is all-powerful doesnt mean everything He does or says is automatically morally justified by His power alone. We can agree that supreme power comes with perks, but power without any standard of goodness or justice is just tyranny. If God's rules are inherently moral, they should stand up to scrutiny based on qualities like fairness, compassion, and consistency. If they dont, it raises the question of whether those rules truly come from a benevolent, all-powerful being or if theyre just man-made ideas dressed up in divine authority.And finally, if a religion claims to have divine authority but doesnt have a way to demonstrate that its teachings truly come from God, then its not just about whether its \\"true\\" or notits about whether it's actually useful or just a collection of cultural myths and social control mechanisms. At that point, the question of morality becomes secondary to the much larger question of whether the religion is even based on anything real in the first place. Idk, maybe this is just the atheist in me talking.Regardless, I still think we should try to understand religious morality in a human context via discussion and logical reasoning.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Stay calm but throw punches when called for.","title":"Jeffries says Dems must stay calm through all of the turbulence amid narrow margin"},{"text":"I hope we can get rid of the military industrial complex next.","title":"Is Bernie Sanders finally breaking bad?"},{"text":"I would fucking do it.

What you claim is \\"good\\" has the same moral weight as what you think is \\"evil\\".If you look at human history, you realize people have rationalized all different kinds of contradictory actions to be good or evil. Atheists and many others often just rationalize the values and morals their cultural upbringing supports to be  good. Not realizing that there is no way you can objectively prove those things to be good, and that the same people would support entirely different morals and values, had their context be different. Third, it's a category error to treat gods with the Divine, or a higher power. Even some polytheistic religions have some variation of their group who understand Allah/God/Yahweh to be One Divine power.

It's more along the line of you can't help someone who doesn't want your help. Christians, depending on the denomination and it's hard to paint them all with the same brush, might believe in original sin, certainly believe that human nature is inherently sinful, so hell is just the default case if nothing is actively done to save your soul. It's not that God is refusing humans access to heaven unless they worship him, it's that God granted humans free will and one of the choices humans can make is to refuse God's freely offered help in achieving salvation.You're looking at different religions from the perspective of \\"what would you want to be true\\".

These religions you speak of are exclusive in the sense that they are monotheistic and their God demands that only He is to be worshipped and can save This goes back to the moral framework someone mentioned above.If you believe in absolute truth, as I do, then regardless of what you feel about it, there is one spiritual truth and according to Christianity, one God. A search for absolute truth and believing in the God of Christianity automatically precludes other religions from being true. So, regardless of how some may feel about Him judging people and not saving them, it might be true. The salvation through Jesus in the Bible is merciful and unwarranted based on humanities behavior and the Bible specifically states that all men have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. The God described is perfectly righteous and cannot even be in the presence of the unrighteous., Out of mercy and love, He provided a way to save man. In doing so, He?is throwing mankind a life raft, so to speak. He didnt have to do anything of the sort.?The Bible actually describes hell as a horrible place not because of your standards of torture but because it is eternal human existence in complete absence of the presence of God. These people that reject God, the one true God, are not being torn limb from limb forever! They are being given just as they wanted- life apart from God. Unfortunately, if you believe man is designed by God in His image and is most complete and fulfilled in closest relationship to God, you will also believe this existence is one not worth having and thus torturous. That is what the Bible teaches.?Any moral standard that you have is irrelevant. Its nice that you think your moral standard is common to man but studying world societies and religions shows it is not. It is nice that you have empathy for the men who do not choose the one true God, but you are not the arbiter of justice if God exists, He is. He, as Creator and designer of the human race and universe has a better understanding of what is best for all and what is right.?What you describe thinking is that you believe your judgments of mens hearts and actions are just on par with what Gods would be and clearly God should save these moral men. Perhaps you are envisioning a small god who is more like a man and thinks like a man and can be in the presence of a sinful man. The God of the Bible is no such God and is beyond us in every sense. According to the Bible, the heart of man is deceitful and cant be trusted and there is some implication that man will be biased in his search for truth and it will prevent many from seeing truth. Once God opens your eyes to truth, these things become illuminated and you understand. Apart from experiencing that, it may be hard for you to comprehend how so many believe.?","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Im also Catholic.

They all demand one to have walked the path.\\\\ Why should someone who has lived an ethical and compassionate life be condemned simply because they didnt believe in a specific deity, while a believer who acts unethically is rewarded?I don't think any religion believes this. Each has incredibly high moral standards of conduct.E.g. Christianity: \\"Entrance to the kingdom of heaven is limited to those who truly, fully do the will of His Father in heaven\\"\\\\ This framework seems inherently unfair. Why should someones birthplace or exposure to a particular religion determine their spiritual fate?Why should one's genetics including personality, temperament, intelligence, etc, determine their spiritual fate? IMO the only solution is reincarnation - each individual life can never have equal chances at salvation, but all souls will eventually have the opportunity to do so. Each life should be a stepping stone progressing one closer to the goal.Each religion doesn't have to mention reincarnation. It's not essential to know about reincarnation to make spiritual progress, which is the only real and true purpose of religion.Remember that each religion and what people commonly believe today is a matter of interpretation. For example, with Christianity, Jesus says that the only way to the Father is through me. But what does this really mean? Is Jesus limited to his form as a man, and one has to dedicate one's attention to this form? I do not interpret it this way. Right before claiming this, Jesus clarifies what he is:\\"I am the way, the truth, and the life.\\"This is exactly the same as claiming the Buddha is the living embodiment of the Dharma.There are just seperate forms or aspects of the same underlying, total and absolute truth.

The first written record of Christianity is Paul's first letter to Thessaloniki, a Greek city in the Roman Empire. His audience is probably a mix of Jews and Greeks, a quite radical notion of the time. This is evidence that from the litteral beginning of historical Christianity of that it was a universal religion. Paul would later spell out his ideas in another letter to Greece, Corinth. Anyone from any tribe or nation could worship in the same community. But the actual topic of the afterlife is the central problem of the letter. Paul makes it clear that death won't cut off anyone from salvation because the dead will be resurrected and will greet Jesus as their celestial king. The purpose of this letter was to correct an apparent idea in the city that those who died would cut off from this utopian kingdom.?\\nSo we can see that the problem you have raised is derived from this solution. Because everyone would be resurrected all people who in Paul's words \\"For God has destined us not for wrath but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,?who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep we may live with him.\\"?\\nAnd Paul thought that this would happen in his own words, again from the first historical document of Christianity.\\n\\"For the Lord himself, with a cry of command, with the archangels call and with the sound of Gods trumpet, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first.?Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up in the clouds together with them to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will be with the Lord forever.\\"Heaven clearly isn't some abstract nowhere place where souls chill out in bliss. He's talking about Earth's atmosphere.?You can see that your view might be placing a focus on a very abstracted idea of souls being sent one place or another; to bliss or torment.?In the actual historical context these ideas play out?very differently, the focus is typically about the fate of dead family and friends. It's not realistic to ignore both the historical context where these ideas started from nor the social problems they were designed to solve.?\\nThe exact way that these ideas changed over time from culture to culture overtime is also fascinating and sometimes horrific. The horrors of forced conversion are very real both today and in the past. What matters is lived reality not the intellectual debate on whether a given afterlife is ethically optimal or not. This lived reality gives us far more insight and raises for interesting and pressing ethical questions such as: when is it ethical to enforce your beliefs on others, what is the best social role for religion, and the ethical problems around missionary work.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Christianity shows that all are sinners and are incapable of saving themselves.

His economic populism appeals to independents and working-class voters who often dont participate in primaries, which are dominated by more traditional Democratic voters. That doesnt mean his ideas cant resonate in a general election, it just means the primary process doesnt favor outsider candidates like him.The solution isnt necessarily to abandon or double down on progressive candidates, its to communicate policies more effectively and connect them to peoples lived experiences.

[Prop 36](https://calmatters.org/california-voter-guide-2024/propositions/prop-36-crime-penalties/) which mandated harsher criminal penalties for drug crimes and theft passed against progressive opposition. [Prop 33](https://calmatters.org/california-voter-guide-2024/propositions/prop-33-rent-control/) which would have mandated rent control failed despite progressive support. [Prop 6](https://calmatters.org/california-voter-guide-2024/propositions/prop-6-involuntary-servitude/) would have banned involuntary prison labor, which progressives supported, and that failed. [Prop 32](https://calmatters.org/california-voter-guide-2024/propositions/prop-32-minimum-wage/) would have raised the state's minimum wage to $18/hr and that failed. [Prop 5](https://calmatters.org/california-voter-guide-2024/propositions/prop-5-vote-threshold/) would have made it easier for cities to borrow money for low income housing and that failed. There was also the [Oregon measure to recriminalize drugs](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/oregon-law-rolling-back-drug-decriminalization-takes-effect-making-possession-a-crime-again) which passed despite progressive opposition.I worry that when you say voters favor progressive policies, you're referring to legalized abortion or marijuana or something, but these are not really specifically \\"leftist policies\\" but rather are very mainstream at this point.

Bernies decision to run within the Democratic primary wasnt about demanding their whole support it was about bringing his vision of systemic change to a wider audience through the most viable platform available. His lifelong independence didnt negate his ability to energize millions of voters, many of whom were new to the political process or deeply disillusioned with the status quo. The DNC and Hillary Clinton, as revealed by the 2016 leaks, did take steps that undermined the perception of a fair primary. This hurt the partys credibility and alienated some of Bernies supporters. Rather than resisting his movement, the Democratic establishment could have benefited from acknowledging the enthusiasm and energy he brought to the table. Policies like Medicare for All, tuition-free college, and aggressive climate action were (and still are) the writing on the wall for a new generation of voters. Instead of marginalizing Bernies ideas, the DNC might have strengthened the party by embracing them.Regarding the comparison to Trump and the RNC, the key difference isnt just the primary results but how the respective parties responded. The RNC didnt want Trump, but they couldnt deny the surge of real votes behind him. Bernies campaign also had real supportnot just Reddit upvotes, but structural barriers like superdelegates and the consolidated media narrative limited his momentum. The Democratic Partys handling of 2016 reflected a reluctance to adapt to shifting political realities.This isnt about the Democrats bowing their knees to outsiders, its about recognizing when an outsider has struck a chord with millions of Americans. Bernies campaign showed the Democratic Party a path to energize working-class voters, young people, and independents.

Two points:- in Judaism, any person - Jew or not - is exactly equal in righteousness if they follow certain basic moral laws. These laws are known as the Noahide laws after the Prophet Noah - who was, in the mythology, a righteous man, but who was not Jewish (Judaism did not exist yet) and was the ancestor, in the mythology, of everyone on Earth. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Laws_of_NoahThis is one of the oldest attempts to create a universal morality applicable to everyone. It certainly is not perfect (they waste, in my opinion, one on not worshiping idols and another on not blaspheming god), but it certainly is not the case that in Judaism only Jews can be righteous. In reality, someone who is not Jewish but who follows the Noahide laws is equally as righteous as the mist religious Jew who follows the mitzvot. - The chosen people point: This repeats a common (common to non-Jews anyway) misunderstanding of what Jews being the chosen people means. As noted above, it simply died not mean chosen for a superior fate in the afterlife (as stated, everyone following the Noahide laws is equally righteous to the most observant Jew - and following the Noahide laws is a **choice**). So what does it mean? Basically, that as a result of an ancient covenant between God and the Jewish people, Jews are expected to follow a multitude of laws not applicable to non-Jews: in return, God had promised them that they will never be destroyed. The reason for this (allegedly) is so that Jews can, by existing in this particular way, be a light unto the nations (that is, to the non-Jewish peoples of the world) each of whom may have quite different laws and customs. **According to Judaism itself**, there is no need for non-Jews to adopt Jewish laws and customs (as long as they follow the Noahide laws of basic morality). Thus, *Judaism does not seek to proselytize*, and indeed that would have no point: each people should, according to Judaism, follow their own ancestral customs  as long as these adhere to basic moral law. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews_as_the_chosen_peopleNow some Jews, specifically some in the Reconstructionist community, expressly reject the chosen people idea - because it *implies* that Jews are superior to others. However, most Jews (including many Reconstructionists) reject this criticism as being a straw man based on accepting the misunderstandings of non-Jews as fact: Jews generally do not believe Jews being the chosen people makes a superiority claim.But whether that is true or not, one thing is absolutely certain: there is no mainstream Jewish belief among any major branch of Judaism that believes being a chosen people means Jews have a superior afterlife than non-Jews simply by being Jews.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Make America Genius Again...

Those outside the \\"family\\" are not afforded the same relationship with God, no matter how virtuous their works may be.Let's suppose that Christianity is the true religion. I think that if there was a Muslim, Buddhist, Atheist, etc person living within a Christian country and who therefore had a lot of exposure to Christian teachigns but chose not to follow them, they should still be able to go to heaven if they lived a moral life.

It implies that morality and virtue are secondary to belonging to the right group or reciting the right creed\\" but this is not correct for any of the three monotheisms:With respect to Judaism, Judaism does not teach that Jews are somehow superior relative to other peoples or that Judaism is the correct religion for all people. When it comes to salvation, further, Judaism claims that it is harder for a Jew to achieve salvation than for a Gentile to achieve salvation because Judaism would argue that Jews have a distinct purpose and mission in the world and Gentiles have a different purpose and mission in the world and these two missions are complimentary. So, Judaism does not argue that morality or virtue are contingent to belonging to the correct group or reciting the correct creed.With respect to Christianity, the fundamental teaching of Christianity is that no human being can achieve salvation. The Sacrifice Upon the Cross is God providing an avenue for an individual to achieve salvation through the grace of God himself. Accordingly, it is the virtue of understanding human limitation and divine agape (selfless love) that leads to the Christian achieving salvation, not dint of birth. A person could be born into Christianity but not understand what the Sacrifice Upon the Cross is or how humans are limited. This person will not be saved. Further, as others have stated, a person who is not aware of the Sacrifice Upon the Cross with sufficient understanding to grasp this point would not be punished by God. So, Christianity does not argue that morality or virtue are contingent to belonging to the correct group or having the correct creed, if such creed was logistically impossible to have.With respect to Islam, the Qur'an recognizes Judaism, Christianity, and Sabeanism as acceptable faiths for achieving salvation, calling these three religions: Peoples of the Book (Ahl al-Kitaab) or People under Protection (Ahl ad-Dhimma). These became legal categories and classifications under Muslim-majority states and those categories often expanded to include peoples of other faiths like Hanifs and Zoroastrians. If other religions are acceptable, then having an Islamic belief is not key to achieving salvation.Perhaps more importantly, we should understand that the Dharmic Concept of Salvation is to escape Samsarra, a condition which none of the Abrahamic Faiths claim either exists (since reincarnation is widely rejected across Abrahamic Faiths with some minor exceptions) and life is considered a gift, not a source of pain. So, the salvation that the Dharmic Faiths promise would seem absurd to an Abrahamic believer since there is no \\"imprisonment\\" in the mortal coil and no forced reincarnation. Salvation in the Abrahamic traditions is achieving a closeness to the Divine such that soul is content and at peace as opposed to being spiritually tormented for its wickedness.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"The core issue Im addressing isnt tied to the specific terminology but to the broader principle of exclusivity versus inclusivity in religious systems. Even if Eastern religions conceptualize \\"salvation\\" differentlynirvana, moksha, or simply ethical livingthe key distinction is that these systems generally dont bar people from spiritual fulfillment based on adherence to specific doctrines. They prioritize actions, intentions, and personal growth, which creates a more inclusive framework.If we were to focus solely on linguistic or doctrinal differences, wed miss the underlying ethical comparison Im making. Regardless of what salvation or faith means within each tradition, the question is whether excluding people based on belief alone is morally justifiable. Eastern traditions largely avoid this issue, while many Abrahamic systems struggle with it. Language doesnt obscure that differenceit highlights it.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"Your understanding of Abrahamic religions seems oversimplified. Let me address a few key points: This strikes me as morally problematic, especially when compared to the more inclusive or flexible perspectives found in many Eastern religionsThis is a common misconception. Eastern religions can be extremely exclusive in their own ways. Try being a beef-eating outcaste in traditional Hinduism, or violating Buddhist precepts while seeking nirvana. These religions often have rigid hierarchical structures and strict requirements for spiritual advancement. Why should someone's birthplace or exposure to a particular religion determine their spiritual fate?Many Christian and Islamic scholars actually address this. The concept of \\"invincible ignorance\\" in Catholicism suggests those who never had a real chance to know about Christianity might still achieve salvation. Similarly, Islamic scholars discuss the fate of people who never properly heard the message of Islam. It implies that morality and virtue are secondary to belonging to the right group or reciting the right creedNot really. The logic in Abrahamic faiths is that if there is one true God who created everything, then acknowledging this truth is itself a moral imperative. It's like saying \\"you must accept reality to live properly in it.\\" The exclusivity isn't arbitrary - it's based on the premise that there are fundamental truths about existence.I'd argue the Eastern religions you praise can actually be more problematic. The karma system essentially victim-blames people for their suffering (you're poor because you were bad in a past life), while Abrahamic religions often emphasize helping the less fortunate regardless of their \\"spiritual status.\\"Finally, calling religions \\"morally inferior\\" is itself a kind of exclusivist thinking. You're doing exactly what you accuse these religions of doing - creating an in-group (inclusive religions) and an out-group (exclusive religions) based on your own moral framework.","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"I encourage them to demand audits of every election, weed out fraudulent votes, etc.","title":"Dem Lawyers Urge Congress To Ignore Electoral College, Stop Trump, Make Kamala President"},{"text":"Of course Im using an external moral frameworkhow else would anyone evaluate the moral claims of a religion?

For Christianity, the idea of the \\"cosmic church\\" is intriguing, but it still relies on being unknowingly aligned with Christian principles, which feels like a backdoor rather than an upfront acknowledgment of pluralism.These nuances are steps in the right direction, but they dont fully address the core issue: salvation remains fundamentally tied to specific doctrines or frameworks rather than a universal focus on virtue or morality.

If we are talking about the first, religion's position in society is not only to keep moral order, but also to keep everyone united. Nationalism/fear of outsiders is an incredibly powerful force for a state or group which allowed monotheistic religions to become the masters of a big part of the world. After all, devotion to a cause and a group can be the foundation to a society, so as a purely social construction, I believe western religions are better.If we are talking about purely ethically and morally, we must first recognize that this discussion in a bit absurd: people view religion (wrongly in my opinion) as truths. A religious fanatic wrongly sees the edict and commandment of his faith like a physicist view the laws of physics. Therefore, evaluating whether it's more moral to believe in a central divine entity rather than universal laws/forces - like karma and enlightenment is quite strange.However, I still believe that it's better for a moral system to be based on centralization. Most religions are willing to get new believers at any price - sometimes even forcing conversions- meaning that it's not about keeping people out, it's about having a united belief system. Therefore, my argument is that an unified moral system based on doctrines is better than personalized ones. Most humans are morally idiotic: they don't ponder about good and evil. They do what they are told from their parents (that's why a big part of religious population had religious parents) and do what they \\"feel\\" is right. After all, why do you think appeal to emotions through the presentation of shocking consequences is such an effective oratory technique? Therefore, if you just tell people to \\"do good\\", \\"be ethical\\", most people are going to ask \\"how\\". If let to their own design, everyone will have their own version of \\"morality\\" and \\"doing good\\" and most of those morality will be full of holes. From my reading on psychology, people tend to use logic to justify their preconceived notions rather than basing their beliefs on logics. Therefore, a vast part of the population will be able to gaslight themselves into thinking that anything is acceptable and justify any terrible thing they want to do. Of course, I am not blaming or insulting people: no one ever taught you how to think \\"what is good?\\", \\"what is evil?\\", why XYZ is good or evil?\\". We were just told to \\"follow the rules\\", \\"do what your parents/teachers tell you to do\\". Therefore, what better than religion, the threat of the ultimate punishment, to get everyone on the same line?","title":"CMV: Religions That Bar Non-Believers From Salvation Are Morally Inferior"},{"text":"The book says a lot of things.

You arent saved through works, you are saved through belief since God has grace for us. In believing in Jesus and forming a connection to God through prayer and community in the body of the church you will be compelled to do good works and be a morally righteous person. However, nobody is saved from their works alone because everyone since at heart.?Its also not exclusive at all. You dont have to do anything to be Christian, you just have to believe. The religion isnt centered on being moralistic, but good morals are just a by product of belief.?If you want to talk about a broader sense of justice, you need some source of objective morality. Having a God who has a sense of objective good and evil who gave us all some sense of right and wrong answers this question pretty well.?Ofc plenty of people will practice Christianity badly, myself included at times.

Simply putting a candidate in who actually does resemble the \\"leftist radical\\" label the right wants to apply will not make this tactic any less effective. The evidence would, in fact, suggest it would be *more* effective. Probably the single most damaging piece of video used against VP Harris was an interview she gave in which she said she'd support immigrants in prison getting government funded gender reassignment surgery. The fact that she said this over 5 years ago and has since changed her mind didn't matter to many voters. It doesn't take much to imagine the field day Republican strategists would have compiling video compilations of things Bernie has said over the years that would scare centrist voters away from him. The exit polls are pretty clear on this: Kamala didn't lose because voters thought she was too moderate, she lost because people were worried she was much more to the left than she actually was. I want to be clear: I would absolutely love it if it was clear that the general electorate was desperately crying out for leftist candidates and extremely progressive policies, but the evidence is very much to the contrary here. We didn't end up with a Republican sweep because people want progressivism. You can even look at local elections in deeply blue areas like Los Angeles, San Francisco and Oregon and see strong progressive candidates and policies that lost badly in this election. If we want the country to move in a further left direction, we need to change the voters minds, not the candidates who are running. There's a reason leftist candidates often lose primaries: because even most Democratic voters don't agree with them. We need a grassroots movement from the bottom up, not the top down. Just putting leftist candidates on general election ballots right now will only guarantee losses.","title":"Sanders pens Fox News op-ed slamming political power of billionaires: That is not democracy"},{"text":"I'm sure the kids have a great nanny, nothing will change there","title":"Jay-Z takes a major loss as a federal judge denies his attempt to dismiss a lawsuit filed by a woman accusing him and Diddy of raping her after the MTV Music Awards when she was just 13 years old."},{"text":"I'm a \\"practical politics\\" person.The thing that the Rs have figured out for most of the last 30ish years is that you can talk political nuances until you're blue in the face, but if you cannot win votes, it's all just academic speculation.Go throw your fit over the platform, and keep not getting anyone in office, and see where it gets you.

If you want me to review a video for you I will, otherwise I'm sorry I can't help you.and this was the kind of gaslighting bullshit i was waiting for!!! so thanks for that!yeah anyone reading this.  this explanation is for you who might not be aware of this.  it does not apply to gaslighting engineers.  as a plane flies, air vortices spin off the end of the wing.  there will be 2 vortices, one for each wing.  the vortices continue in the direction of the path they were on when they separated from the wing.  which is to say they run parallel to the path of the plane.  they are slower than the plane.  there are loads of video of this phenomenon.  it's a canonical phenomenon.  it is very well known and well understood.  there are some videos that show coloured smoke being released in the air and a plane flies thru this, and the toruses of air are visible and you can visualize the phenomenon.the toruses will be stronger (ie. have more momentum) when the wings are lower in altitude and thus the air is more dense, and when the plane is moving faster, and generating a faster torus.  both of which were in play during 911. big planes at high speeds and low altitudes.pretty straightforward.there is NO video from 911 showing vortices disrupting the billowing smoke that came out of the explosions.  none.  this is physically impossible.is what it is.","title":"9-11 A full breakdown on the engineering / physics conspiracy side."},{"text":"Two sides of the same coin.

Yet Biden chose her as his running mate, knowing that would likely lead to a later bid for her to become president, and the entire Democratic leadership immediately rallied around her when Biden withdrew his candidacy.

I agree with almost everything Bernie Sanders says and believes in, but I think he's totally unrealistic about how to achieve any of it. So many leftists seem to believe if Bernie had just won the primary then he'd have won the general election and everything would have been fixed. But Bernie didn't have the votes to win the primary, he'd have been branded as an extreme socialist by the right in a way that would have been just as damaging in a general election as it was with Biden and Harris. And even if he'd won, he'd have still only been able to sign legislation that passed both houses of Congress, which would have meant getting Republican support. So this idea that Bernie could have just turned America into a leftist utopia is simply unrealistic nonsense. I appreciate idealists, but we need pragmatists who recognize where the electorate is actually at, rather than just assuming the masses all agree with them.","title":"Sanders pens Fox News op-ed slamming political power of billionaires: That is not democracy"},{"text":"That has way more to do with China being an authoritarian government than California being bad at building shit.

When our country was smaller, it was acceptable for voters to elect a representative, and have that representative vote on our behalf. But we decided instead to have a weighted system where Congress votes on some things, vets people like the Supreme Court to decide some things, and allows the President to appoint others, who then appoint others who hire others to make regulations that we have to follow. We have a similar system at the state level, at the county level and at the city level. We have school boards, HOAs, and many other forms of government that make rules that we have to follow. Thus some people cant get on an airplane without taking off their shoes to pass screening. We didnt vote on that, Congress didnt vote on that, the Supreme Court didnt require that, the President didnt decide that. Even the airport did not have a say in that.

The other beams holding concrete spanning between different columns unaffected are likewise not effected.The middle dropping causes the Outside to be pulled inwards. The exact opposite would happen if you clipped the whole side.

America has been fair enough to still call democracy  there are lots of disenfranchised people, gerrymandering, and polling place strategy. But still pretty fair (overlooking the fact that modern presidential elections are always decided by tens of thousands of voters in the same 7-8 states, no matter what the popular vote holds). Not so sure about the future, but we will see. The GOP does consistently attack voting. But to be clear again, I strongly support voting. Its the easiest, most peaceful step to protecting your rights. Voting doesnt work well when corporations fund the politicians, so mainstream views that go against donor interests need massive, almost impossible levels of support to overcome the status quo. It also doesnt work well when the population cannot connect their beliefs or needs to the correct policies. Misinformation on traditional and social media, AI its bad out there, as we both surely know. The election of Trump, twice, is prima facie proof of this. And what boundaries can an elected politician cross before the system that was supposed to keep them in check has clearly failed, and you must resist beyond the normal political process? Thats a big question, especially with a fascist president immune from criminal liability for official acts, with a radical Supreme Court. I agree that people arent engaged enough to protest and fight en masse. I do think many people who dont vote would be energized by something that feels more real  I recall recordings of early 20th century unions singing labor songs, connecting people and thus making them feel the community they needed to vote, demonstrate, and resist even when police murdered them for picketing. These days, we are more isolated. My hope  maybe irrational  is that when things get bad enough, people will snap out of it and begin to blame the right people more often and get organized. As common people did during important periods in US history where we reasserted old rights and sometimes gained new ones. Our technological advancements and overconsumption in the 20th and 21st centuries have led to an unusual situation: even the poorest people in the USA can afford ice cream, and the lower-middle class has video games and television. People arent as likely to risk their lives/livelihoods engaging in disobedient and disruptive political participation until they arent so comfortable day to day. Im not excited for this, but sometimes the public should feel angry and steep in it rather than being perpetually distracted.","title":"Election lawyer warns GOP majority plotting new \\"voter suppression laws\\" to get \\"partisan advantage\\" - After winning trifecta in White House and Congress, GOP plans to make voting harder, Democrats say"},{"text":"I can't remember where, but I recall reading it would only take between 10-20% of the workforce going on strike to more or less bring the country to a halt.

He believed that through my ability to disassociate I would literally become possessed by another spirit or entity when in this state and would therefore allow those spirits or entities to use my body to perform the work that needed to be done for Uncle Sam, God, or family. For the record, I do not believe that I was ever possessed by spirits, demons, or entities, but rather have been made to operate in a disassociated state of consciousness under certain personalities created within me under times of extreme trauma.

Israel may claim that Hamas builds bases in hospitals, for instance, but that doesn't make it reality. I don't believe Israel has ever been able to prove such claims and has historically been known to lie about its attacks.[You mean, proof like providing media with a tour of a Hamas facility under a Gaza hospital after they captured it last year?](https://youtu.be/RV4Nn5Sz6Ds?si=6alrnlzHExA7bRrc)I mean, there is a giant tunnel system under Gaza city that Israel has been working to clear for over a year. Are you doubting that exists? Or are you under the impression it is located in some sort of military district, as opposed to under the city's civilian population?Secondly, none of the things you lost are a use of human shields. The use of human shields refers to specific war crimes e.g. Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 28. While if this did occur it would be a war crime, e.g. under Geneva Conventions AP I article 12, it would be a separate war crime from human shields.Call it whatever you want, as long as you acknowledge it is a war crime. But, the result is the same.Israel's war crimes have been documented for decadeAs you said, Hamas claiming war crimes does not make them so.1948 was Israel's ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, Bullshit. Arab armies literally invaded the day after independence was declared and you want to pretend it was because of supposed ethnic cleansing?!Come on, don't piss on me and try to call it rain.Yom Kippor was Israel's illegal occupation of the Sinai and Golan Heights.\\"Illegal occupation\\"? You mean the territory Egypt and Syria lost when they lost their attempted invasion of Israel?International law is clear that you can't take land in a war of conquest, but you can in a defensive war. Invade another country, and you only have yourself to blame for your losses. There was nothing illegal about it. There are consequences for invading a neighbour.Are Palestinian simple-minded robots which listen to only Hamas propaganda?I wouldn't call them simple minded robots, but yes. It isn't a secret that propaganda works. Wrong. The right of return is a right every single refugee in the world has and is not a demand by Israel. Palestinians have been willing to compromise on this in the past and largely give up their right of return, but the large Palestinian concessions have never been enough to satisfy Israeli demands.That's ridiculous, and.every Palestinian negotiator has known the right of return is not a realistic ask. It is not a concession to ask for the sun the moon and then say \\"ok, just the sun then.\\"They are literally doing it right now and have been carrying on a slow campaign of ethnic cleansing for decades, balancing the desire to remove Palestinians with the need to not be too openly criminal.If they are then they truly suck at it,  since Gaza has more than tripled in population since 1990 from 650k people to 2.2M.This is war crimes apologism. Proportionality is a key component of international law and there is never ANY excuse for ignoring it.So, what is the \\"proportional response\\" to a group of religious zealots willing to give their lives for the cause of wiping out your race?Is this another of those one-sided rules that Israel has to comply with when Hamas will blatantly disregard it at every turn?What was October 7th the proportionate response to?

One of them, Jeff van Drew, was elected as a Dem and switched to the GOP.* We have 100 Senators.  None of them switched from Dem to GOP.  Even the Independents still caucused as Dems and voted the same way they did before, or were always Independents who caucused with Dems.* Across the country, we have over 7,000 elected State Reps and Senators.  Over the last few years, we had *four* elected Dems flip to the GOP.  Tricia Cotham in NC (defeated next election), Meisha Mainor in GA (defeated next election), and these two ding-dongs (top of the target list in Florida in 2026).  Most of the conservative Dems from the South who already had essentially Republican beliefs have already made the switch.The point is: *Most Dems can be trusted to remain Dems.*  That includes moderates, progressives, and folks on either side of your pet issue.

Along comes Clinton and his ilk with a way to win, by shifting rightward on a few issues while still advancing left policy in others. This sparks a backlash on the left who thinks he's not left enough, leading to Nader, which gives us GW Bush. Bush fucks things up, Obama comes in and establishing the pattern we're seemingly stuck in, which is:\\\\-Democrats get elected, push for better policies, but don't do so aggressively enough to satisfy the left.\\\\-The Right wins the next election, because left/progressive voters stay home, and proceeds to fuck things up royally.\\\\-Democrats win control back, and we're back to step one.The left argues that Democrats need to move more aggressively, but the problem is that has yet to be proven accurate at the voting booth. We've seen time and again them make attempts to improve things, only for the public to turn around and respond by giving the Right control again. It's utterly foolish on several levels, one being because it just reinforces the notion that the public doesn't like progressive policy, not to mention the damage being done by the Republicans in the meantime, especially to vulnerable people.Asking for a sudden hallelujah moment where the Democrats suddenly have the power to pass the entire progressive agenda just isn't going to fucking happen. Even FDR with his massive post-depression landslide and supermajority couldn't pass his entire agenda. And quite personally, I'd rather us NOT have to go through another Great Depression equivalent hellscape in order to get to that.The answer is bleedingly obvious too, but people don't like it because it means sometimes you have to vote for the lesser evil. That is, you vote relentlessly for the leftmost viable candidate in every primary and general election, WHOEVER THAT IS. If someone turns out to be a shitbag, like Sinema or now Fetterman for instance, fucking primary them. But staying home in the general election? No, fuck no. That's how we lost the Supreme Court (due to Republicans taking the Senate in 2014 because left/progressive voters stayed home), not to mention so many other elections since, and thus ended up putting us on the road we're now on.","title":"Democratic strategist calls for new generation of leaders as party plots response to Trumps victory"},{"text":"Waiting for them to finish each other off","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 27, 2024"},{"text":"\\"I'm not going to compromise my principles!\\"As if \\"compromised principles\\" are anything other than an immaterial abstraction that has zero bearing on material reality.Fascist getting their hands on the levers of federal power, on the other hand?

I'm speaking as a former Wiccan/Norse Reconstructionist. Check out St. Joseph's statue ritual. Catholics bury them in their property in order to help it sell. That sounds like nothing Jesus would have been into. Also, Mary's title as \\"The Queen of Heaven\\" was formerly held by Semiramis, who was also revered as a Virgin Queen after giving birth to Tammuz, after the death of Nimrod. No other major religion to my knowledge refers to a singular female ruler of Heaven, since the time of Semiramis, until Mary, who Catholics revere over both the Father and the Sun, to create their own Holy Trinity, mirroring Nimrod, Semiramis and Tammuz, who in turn were mirrored in Osiris, Isis, and Horus, and so on. None of this is Misogy, nor an excuse for it, at least it's not when it comes to me.Semiramis basically told everyone, \\"Ummm, I don't know... the Sun did it? Yeah! The Sun did it, which also happens to be the resurrected incarnation of Nimrod. You guys should toooootally worship him. But until he comes back, how's about that big ball up there?\\" Tammuz was ultimately killed by a boar, Game of Thrones fans! This is why we eat Ham for Easter, since Semiramis was also the goddesses Easter/Astarte/Ostara/Isis/Innana/Freya and others. Leave it to the Norse to butcher the naming convention. Their pork loin, I'm sure though, is on point.Supposedly, it is during the birth of Tammuz, where Solar Deity worship began en masse. Nimrod is the SUN, who was reborn as his own SON, Tammuz. The obelisk outside St. Peter's Basilica, and the square itself, are pretty well known symbols of Sun Worship. That, and penises.This is why modern day Christians, at least since I've been alive, forbid looking into, or even discussing other religions. The Clergy don't want us all coming together to ask each other questions and exchange notes, as directed by Big Government. Supposedly this is a part of the 501C3 agreements that allow them to remain tax-free organizations. Mislead the Sheep.It's impossible to get a full picture when you only have 6 puzzle pieces out of 500, which again, is all a part of the grand scheme.","title":"Does anyone else think that aliens are really demons?"},{"text":"It's not about the Jewish people.

The West simply doesn't want Russia to exist as a nation that works in the best interests of ordinary Russians and put Russia in an existential position.Also, if Russia were looting Ukraine, as you dishonestly claim, why doesn't Ukraine have a huge exports of energy before 2022 from Ukraine to Russia? Hint: Before the conflict and even during the conflict, Russia was exporting energy to Ukraine. As I noted, Russia was in the 1990s being looted by the West. Europe is still reliant on Russia, although since Putin has taken over, forced to pay the Russians fairer (though still favorable to Europe) prices. By contrast, to prove my point, we can see the Europeans were reliant on Russian resources and now that they have stupidly sanctioned themselves, Germany is deindustralizing, while Europeans as a whole see huge increases to living costs as a result of their increased energy costs.","title":"Musks rise is symptomatic of our neo-feudal capitalist times | Trumps billionaire boys club has parallels in other supposedly liberal democracies around the world."},{"text":"I'm sorry but this is just the republican narrative on what the democratic party runs on... they ran on expanding medicare, combatting climate change, continued support to Ukraine and more.

A Readers Digest article calls the law the cancer weapon America needs most. All 50 states now run registries to help cancer researchers gain important insights.July 1996: Sanders is one of only 67 (out of 435, 15%) votes against the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act, which denied federal benefits to same-sex couples legally married. Sanders urged the Supreme Court to throw out the law, which it did in a landmark 2013 ruling C some 17 years later.July 1999: Standing up against the major pharmaceutical companies, Sanders becomes the first member of Congress to personally take seniors across the border to Canada to buy lower-cost prescription drugs. The congressman continues his bus trips to Canada with a group of breast cancer patients the following April. These brave women are able to purchase their medications in Canada for almost one-tenth the price charged in the States.August 1999: An overflow crowd of Vermonters packs a St. Michaels College town hall meeting hosted by Sanders to protest an IBM plan to cut older workers pensions by as much as 50 percent. CBS Evening News with Dan Rather and The New York Times cover the event. After IBM enacts the plan, Sanders works to reverse the cuts, passing a pair of amendments to prohibit the federal government from acting to overturn a federal district court decision that ruled that IBMs plan violated pension age discrimination laws. Thanks to Sanders efforts, IBM agreed to a $320 million legal settlement with some 130,000 IBM workers and retirees.December 2007: Sanders authored energy efficiency and conservation grant program passes into law. He later secures $3.2 billion in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for the grant program.September 2008: Thanks to Sanders efforts, funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program funding doubles, helping millions of low-income Americans heat their homes in winter.February 2009: Sanders works with Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley to pass an amendment to an economic recovery bill preventing Wall Street banks that take taxpayer bailouts from replacing laid-off U.S. workers with exploited and poorly-paid foreign workers.December 2009: Sanders passes language in the Affordable Care Act to allow states to apply for waivers to implement pilot health care systems by 2017. The legislation allows states to adopt more comprehensive systems to cover more people at lower costs.March 2010: President Barack Obama signs into law the Affordable Care Act with a major Sanders provision to expand federally qualified community health centers. Sanders secures $12.5 billion in funding for the program which now serves more than 25 million Americans. Another $1.5 billion from a Sanders provision went to the National Health Service Corps for scholarships and loan repayment for doctors and nurses who practice in under-served communities.July 2010: Sanders works with Republican Congressman Ron Paul in the House to pass a measure as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill to audit the Federal Reserve, revealing how the independent agency gave $16 trillion in near zero-interest loans to big banks and businesses after the 2008 economic collapse.March 2013: Sanders, now chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, and backed by seniors, women, veterans, labor unions and disabled Americans, leads a successful effort to stop a chained-CPI proposal supported by Congressional Republicans and the Administration to cut Social Security and disabled veterans benefits.August 2014: A bipartisan $16.5 billion veterans bill written by Sen. Sanders, Sen. John McCain and Rep. Jeff Miller is signed into law by President Barack Obama.

Youre right that they probably wouldnt have been successful packing the court. I wouldve liked to simply see them try. It creates important national conversation and normalizes certain attitudes among the base. I do recall now that Colorado did take Trump off the ballot for violating the insurrection clause and SCOTUS found otherwise. Forgot about that. Labor strikes happen with organizing. But class consciousness needs to develop; big platforms like the DNC could help Americans understand and be more willing to utilize this option. I agree that nothing I cite is likely to succeed, except for the prospect of labor strikes. And it is true that the DNC doesnt organize labor, and has conflicting incentives.I also agree that it is important to vote, volunteer, and donate. As I did for Harris, Biden, and Obama, as well as certain state/local races. I also think it is important for us to be critical of the Democrats even while supporting them.

Those are the stakes, and you are out of your mind if you think Israel should just rely on the good faith the Palestinians have not shown for 80 years in order to ensure their long term safety.Wrong, Hamas changed its charter years ago to reflect freedom for Palestine without destroying Israel. Hamas do still commit war crimes and should immediately stop doing so, but of the two of us I seem to be the only one who thinks war crimes are wrong when committed by either side.Israel is doing what they have to do to protect their civilians. You know what Palestine has to do to protect theirs? Literally nothing...just stop attacking a militarily superior neighbour and forcing it to defend itself.More war crimes apologism in this argument as \\"protecting your own civilians\\" and \\"not committing war crimes\\" aren't mutually exclusive. We also know that's wrong as Israel has refused to grant Palestinian freedom when there has been peace, e.g. with the post-Oslo peace process where we have video recordings of Netanyahu literally bragging about how he wasn't negotiating in good faith and managed to ruin the negotiations.It's unfortunate that actions have consequences, but, by the same token, the consequences of democratically electing Hamas were not exactly unforseen. Shocker that they never ran another election, waged the holy war they said they would wage, and used civilians as pawns in that conflict.War crimes are never a justified consequence of any action.If the Palestinians want peace, they have Israel there to help free them from Hamas. If Hamas isn't using human shield tactics to keep civilians in war zones, then why aren't those civilians leaving when Israel gives public announcements about what areas should be evacuated?Israel is not interested in freeing Palestinians and the idea is as absurd as black South Africans waiting to be peacefully freed from Aparteid.Israel has shown the desire and ability to live at peace with its neighbours. It made peace with Egypt, which has held for decades. The October 7th attack happened because Israel was having normalization talks with Saudi Arabia.Israel made peace with Egypt once it became clear that it wasn't confident it could steal Egypt's land.

Storing Rockets in  Holding hostages in civilian homes? Building a giant tunnel system under civilian areas?Exactly.Firstly, these aren't all things Hamas has been shown to do. Israel may claim that Hamas builds bases in hospitals, for instance, but that doesn't make it reality. I don't believe Israel has ever been able to prove such claims and has historically been known to lie about its attacks.Secondly, none of the things you lost are a use of human shields. The use of human shields refers to specific war crimes e.g. Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 28. While if this did occur it would be a war crime, e.g. under Geneva Conventions AP I article 12, it would be a separate war crime from human shields.Ah, great, so the answer is to stop committing vague unspecified war crimes that Israel hasn't been committing. Very helpful.Israel's war crimes have been documented for decades, including the specific articles and treaties it breaches. If you're not aware of them, that's an issue with your knowledge.__Really? So, the cause of the conflict is war crimes, and the terrorist group with the motto \\"from the river to the sea\\" will just lay down their arms and go home if the unspecified war crimes stop. Very realistic. /s\\"From the river to the sea\\" isn't the Hamas motto, it's an English language chant used by Palestinian supporters to talk about Palestinian freedom from illegal Israeli occupation (Illegal under the UN charter, Geneva conventions, UN Security Council resolutions.)So yes, the phrase that specifically relates to and end to specific Israeli war crimes does have something to do with specific Israeli war crimes. Shocking!And, what was the reason for the previous invasions of Israel by the Arabs, or the decades of terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians? Also unspecified war crimes?No, both times Israel was warred on by neighbouring  Arab countries it was in relation to very specific war crimes.1948 was Israel's ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, Yom Kippor was Israel's illegal occupation of the Sinai and Golan Heights. Equally telling are Israel's attacks on its neighbours, such as the Suez Crisis and Six-day war which were to try to take control of its neighbour's land.Ah, so I guess the Hamas propaganda machine that has been pumping misinformation to the Gaza population for the last decade and half about the evils of Israel will just pass along the accurate information to the civilian population if the unspecified war crimes stop, right?Are Palestinian simple-minded robots which listen to only Hamas propaganda?So, the plan here is to curry favour with Fatah, who also doesn't acknowledge Israel's right to exist, in order to counter Hamas?Fatah recognised Israel's right to exist with the Oslo accords over 30 years ago, yes another basic fact you're unaware of. It has also already collaborated with Israel to undermine Hamas. That is quite the sunshine and roses proposal, which ignores 80 years of failed diplomacy.It has literally already happened.Here's the reality: this could have all ended in 1947 if the Arabs had accepted the UN division of territory. It could have ended dozens of times since then, if Palestine had accepted one of the many deals even more beneficial than that.No, Israeli leaders were not arguing in good faith and the historical record acknowledges that a division of Palestine was accepted by the Jewish side on the basis of them using it as a stepping stone to try and take the Palestinian land in the future. Not only were Palestinians completely justified in their decision, but they would have had to be overwhelmingly stupid to agree to the partition plan.When Israel was weak and vulnerable, the Arabs tried to commit genocide against them. When Israel got the dominant position, they didn't. Israel could have wiped out the Palestinians decades ago with little effort. They have had full military control over Palestine for decades, and haven't.They are literally doing it right now and have been carrying on a slow campaign of ethnic cleansing for decades, balancing the desire to remove Palestinians with the need to not be too openly criminal.Even despite all that, Palestine chooses to be zealously stubborn, continuing to make absurd demands in any negotiations, like the so-called \\"right of return\\", while firing rockets into Israel just to poke the bear in any way they can.Wrong. The right of return is a right every single refugee in the world has and is not a demand by Israel. Palestinians have been willing to compromise on this in the past and largely give up their right of return, but the large Palestinian concessions have never been enough to satisfy Israeli demands.So, no, Israel does not have to engage in a \\"proportional response\\", they need to protect their civilian population, and that means doing what they should have done a decade and a half ago and disabling the infrastructure that Hamas uses to attack Israel.This is war crimes apologism. Proportionality is a key component of international law and there is never ANY excuse for ignoring it.","title":"CMV: What the Israelis are currently doing to the Palestinians is the same thing as the Nazis did to the Jews"},{"text":"I'm not some weird Republican supporter dude.

It concluded that Mr. Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified materials after his vice presidency when he was a private citizen. Nevertheless, Mr. Hur determined that no criminal charges are warranted. Why? In part because a jury would be unlikely to convict a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory and diminished faculties in advancing age.Democrats and their media pals were relieved that Mr. Biden wouldnt face charges, but they bristled at Mr. Hurs descriptions of the presidents declining mental state. In his interview with our office, Mr. Bidens memory was worse than in his recorded conversations with his ghostwriter in 2017, Mr. Hur reported. He did not remember when he was vice president, forgetting on the first day of the interview when his term ended (if it was 2013when did I stop being Vice President?), and forgetting on the second day of the interview when his term began (in 2009, am I still Vice President?). He did not remember, even within several years, when his son Beau died.Vice President Kamala Harris said the revelations were politically motivated, and Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania called them a big nothing burger. The press should know better than to blame the messenger, but that didnt stop Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus from accusing Mr. Hur of overstepping his boundsExcuse me. Is Hur a lawyer or a geriatrician? Whats his expertise in making this damaging assessment?and insisting that his portrayal of Biden as a doddering old man is inconsistent with what I hear from those who have frequent interactions with him.Perhaps no one beclowned himself more than MSNBCs Joe Scarborough, who offered a blanket denunciation of anyone who dared to challenge the presidents soundness of mind and ability to serve a second term. The cable host explained that hed known Mr. Biden for years and that the president had, if anything, grown sharper with age. Im about to tell you the truth, he told his viewers. And f you if you cant handle the truth. This version of Biden intellectually, analytically, is the best Biden ever.Subsequent revelations have been much kinder to Mr. Hur than to his detractors. But weve also learned that Mr. Bidens partisan enablers werent only misleading the public about the presidents condition. The White House staff was also misleading the president himself. Before he dropped out the race, Mr. Biden repeatedly bickered with reporters about the accuracy of polls. In November 2023, a New York Times/Siena College poll showed him trailing Donald Trump in most key states. And although other polls released around the same time showed the same results, the president seemed in complete denial.It happened again after Mr. Bidens fateful debate performance in June. In a desperate effort to convince Americans that he was still up to the job, Mr. Biden sat for an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News. When Mr. Stephanopoulos, citing recent survey data, told Mr. Biden that he wasnt only trailing but had fallen further behind by any measure, the president was perplexed. You guys keep saying that, Mr. Biden replied.Mr. Stephanopoulos explained that Mr. Bidens job-approval rating had dropped to the mid-30s and that the percentage of voters who thought he was too old to serve had doubled since 2020. Over and over, Mr. Biden disputed the numbers. Do you really believe youre not behind right now? asked Mr. Stephanopoulos. All the pollsters I talk to tell me its a toss-up, Mr. Biden answered.Like Mr. Hur, the president may well have been telling the truth. Last week, the Journal reported that Mr. Bidens closest aides and advisers have spent the past four years trying to hide his impairments. Mr. Bidens handlers limited his interactions with cabinet members and lawmakers, scripted his infrequent media appearances, and filtered his access to information. Press aides who compiled packages of news clips for Biden were told by senior staff to exclude negative stories about the president, according to the paper. The president wasnt talking to his own pollsters as surveys showed him trailing in the 2024 race.Its an epic scandal whose scope we are only beginning to appreciate. And it may turn out to be the Biden administrations chief legacy.

I am saying that there's a misunderstanding of this dynamic. Xenophobia and scare tactics have been a part of the Republican playbook since the 70s. Donald Trump is obviously an escalation of that tactic. What progressives are saying, is that someone like Donald Trump is an agent of change for these people.  \\nThe choice for a lot of voters wasn't, \\"I am a racist, therefore, I will tank the economy to make sure a woman of color isn't elected.\\" The dynamic was, \\"This administration isn't promising any structural change but this racist, xenephoibic MIGHT shake things up enough. I will excuse this racism in the hopes that my pocketbook won't go any lighter.\\"I think simply placing voters as 'racists who vote for racists' is reductive and excuses the Democratic party and leadership from it's own failures of leadership, messaging, and decision making. For example, Joe Biden was a lack-luster, ancient president,(someone who really only won in 2020 because being a white-guy to a popular U.S. president during Covid put him just ahead). Yes, he had challenges during his Administration, but that could have been made up with the right leadership and messaging.Again, I don't discount that there is racism and sexism at play but it's not the whole reasoning. Also, having progressive leadership and messaging will help dispel that mindset of Americans that Republicans are better on the economy and all Democrats care about is 'the woke'.","title":"The End of Democratic Delusions"},{"text":"Classic fear-mongering post designed to scare people away from tools like Tor that protect privacy and expose corruption.\\nNotice how its filled with over-the-top horror and self-loathing to manipulate emotions?\\nThis isnt about 'sharing a warning'its about making you afraid of seeking uncensored truth.\\nStay critical, stay curious, and dont let posts like this control your narrative.","title":"Ill never touch the Tor browser again."},{"text":"Pinged DEMOCRACY ([subscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Subscribe%20to%20DEMOCRACY&amp;message=subscribe%20DEMOCRACY) | [unsubscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20DEMOCRACY&amp;message=unsubscribe%20DEMOCRACY) | [history](https://neoliber.al/user_pinger_2/history.html?group_name=DEMOCRACY&amp;count=5))Pinged CHINA ([subscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Subscribe%20to%20CHINA&amp;message=subscribe%20CHINA) | [unsubscribe](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20CHINA&amp;message=unsubscribe%20CHINA) | [history](https://neoliber.al/user_pinger_2/history.html?group_name=CHINA&amp;count=5))\\n[About &amp; Group List](https://reddit.com/r/neoliberal/wiki/user_pinger_2) | [Unsubscribe from all groups](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=groupbot&amp;subject=Unsubscribe%20from%20all%20groups&amp;message=unsubscribe)","title":"Gov't strips HK's 'Father of Democracy' Martin Lee of Justice of the Peace title"},{"text":"!ping China&amp;Democracy","title":"Gov't strips HK's 'Father of Democracy' Martin Lee of Justice of the Peace title"},{"text":"Means nothing if you can lie and gaslight like nothings wrong.

But everyone also knows voting Republicans will ensure cruelty towards minorities, women and LGBTQIA, those voters chose to more for having someone beneath them than for lowing inflation or a better economy.

The moment an actual progressive becomes remotely close to national office the gloves will come off and the right-wing media machine will eat them alive. Americans are not progressives. The last bunch of progressives to run for president - McCarthy, McGovern, Carter, Mondale, Dukakis - all lost by margins so big they are in the history books.But let's play fantasy and pretend that Bernie wins the presidency in 2016 or 2020.

Biden can't even get student loans through, so you can forget about Universal Healthcare or any other truly progressive policy.

The goal would be to destabilize support, not necessarily to gain votes directly. Making Democratic support look weak is enough to sway less informed voters. It also inhibits left leaning groups from providing a unified front against right wing efforts.Either way, we're in a bad position for the foreseeable future.

Yes, he was a democrat but a moderate one that promised to be tough on crime  (true - his policies and laws he signed imprisoned more people of color than anyone in modern US history). He also failed to get healthcare passed but succeeded at signing nafta. Nafta unfairly impacted lower / middle class rural communities that were 1 company towns. Trump voters remember when their bucolic little Rockwell-esque towns went to shit. And they went fast. So fast, they changed and voted Bush jr in *hoping* for something. Then - 9/11 happened! The vast majority of war fighters didnt volunteer out of LA, or NYC - they joined from places like Dayton, OH and Augusta GA. Early in the war, the communities who had a lot of people sign up sent their paychecks back into these communities. Keeping them afloat while wall st manipulated the real estate market and offered sub-prime loans. Beginning about 2006-2007, a lot of the North East and West Coast knew we are in a bubble and shit is gonna blow up - and it did, spectacularly. So - current Trump voters seeing all this said - damn, whos this Obama person? I dont care - hes promising hope and change and thats what we need right now! Sadly - Obama didnt enact policies focused on these communities, he crafted policies that saved what the people felt were the big banks and elites. And - all throughout the Obama administration, the medical experts over subscribed opiates, VA benefits and pay are about 20-40% of what active duty pays - and these communities suffer even more. Sons and daughters return from war broken, addiction spikes, real estate values dont return (unlike the east and west coasts). Enter Trump and the 2016 election. These majority white, mid west and southern voters are pissed because the government, military, medical experts, and traditional business leaders, all failed them. They cant vote neither traditional republican NOR traditional democrat. So - whos the rebel? Donald Trump. Pandemic frustration drove a switch to Biden by actually convincing more than 50% of eligible voters to come out and vote!2024 - Biden didnt make huge strides in helping these communities. Addiction, homelessness, sickness, veteran care, all remain terrible (or - at least the perception is that its terrible). The fact that no one from Purdue pharma is at risk of serious prison time but uncle Billy-Joe just got 20 years for selling oxy slaps of the ultimate injustice. So - lets give Trump one more try. Kamala is NOT a progressive democrat, shes center-left and VERY much a status-quo. Ha! The actual winner of the 2024 election was chose not to vote as neither Trump nor Harris received any majority of eligible voters. When Trump was elected, I thought we were living in 1930s Germany. Im starting to think instead we are living in 1780s France :/. The proletariat is PISSED. Im a democrat, my politics are fairly progressive, and at first I was totally distraught by Trumps election. Now that I realized that he is going to screw his voters in a way like theyve never experienced, Im sipping tea, nodding my head, making popcorn, and focusing on other pursuits. I dont agree with anything Trump does - hes a user. And hes using his voters. His voters will either turn on him or blissfully (and ignorantly) think that theyre finally winning. I wonder if in 1000 years theyll see us now as we see the evolution of the romans. Well all be dust. So - try not to worry too much.

Its just a word Christians attribute the everything they consider evil. Christians went around the world taking gods from competing religions and slapping demon on them. Deities once worshipped and loved by many. Are the Greek gods evil? Roman gods? Sumerian gods? Egyptian gods? So the only good god is the Jewish god of Zion? Demons is a pretty subjective term that essentially means nothing specific. What about the Greek Daimon which predates Christianity? It wasnt evil. It was a lesser god and guiding deity. Crowley never said Lam was a demon by the way. Crowley thought Lam was the Soul of a dead Tibetan Lama. Lam literally means way or path in Tibetan.This dumb take doesnt surprise me though. Theres always Christian fundamentalist trying to tie their beliefs into everything. People who only have an exoteric/surface level understanding of their religion are usually the loudest ones. The reality is probably way more complicated than most people care to acknowledge. I dont know whats going on so I wont pretend too. But I think its more likely the same Elohim  talked about in the Bible are the same deities the Greeks, Sumerians, Hindus, Egyptians, native Americans and many other ancient cultures spoke about. It could also be more materialistic in nature. It could just be very advanced technology from our military. Or maybe a bit more fringe like a break away civilization. What if there was a highly advanced civilization in Antediluvian times. Maybe an enough of them went underground to escape the cataclysm and have thrived in the earth ever since. It makes more sense to live in the earth where you can control the climate and protect yourself from the unpredictable weather on the surface. The Atlanteans coming out of the Atlantic Ocean would be fitting. Personally, Ive seen crazy god like beings on DMT. I dont know what dmt shows us, but I have to believe thats the root of many of these stories and beliefs. Most ancient cultures had rituals around mind altering substances and dmt is so on the money of having an intense spiritual experience, especially with the accompanying ego death.

Prof K discusses the laws and conventions in the case of Israel, before and after 1967.Since the adoption of U.N. Charter, international law prohibits any acquisition of foreign territory by force. There was certainly no such blanket prohibition on territorial change resulting from war in 1967, when Egyptian and Jordanian territory came under Israeli control. At the time, international law only prohibited acquisition of force in illegal or aggressive wars.The U.N. Charter does not make all war illegal. Indeed, it expressly reaffirms the legality of a defensive war. Since defensive war is not illegal, it follows that the defenders territorial gains from such a war would not be illegal.An examination of state practice and international legal opinion shows that international law did not prohibit, and may even have affirmatively sanctioned, defensive conquest as of 1967. There are some cases where territorial annexation resulting from the use of force has resulted in widely-recognized changes in sovereignty even absent any plausible claim of self-defense.The legality of defensive conquest was endorsed by the International Law Commission, a body created by the UN General Assembly. Composed of some of the most distinguished jurists of the time, its work in the immediate post-War period is seen as providing highly authoritative explanations of the UN Charter.In the ILCs drafting of their influential Draft Convention on the Rights and Duties of States (1949) and Draft Code of Offenses Against the Peace and Security of Mankind (1954), the question of the permissible scope of territorial conquest came up repeatedly. The ILC repeatedly recognized that not all territorial changes in war are illegitimate. All agreed that post-war frontier adjustments were justified to help protect the victim of aggression. There was broad consensus territorial change was only impermissible in a war of aggression.In the years immediately following the adoption of the UN Charter, many of the victorious Allies took territory of the defeated nations. All these annexations have been recognized, without controversy by the U.S. and international community. At the close of the Korean War in 1953, the Republic of Korea controlled and claimed sovereignty of portions of territory north of the pre-war boundary at the 38th parallel. Nonetheless, the U.S. and the international community has not seen any obstacle to recognizing Seouls sovereignty over this territory.The U.S. and the international community recognizes the Socialist Republic of Vietnam as sovereign over both north and south Vietnam, though of course it conquered much of it in an aggressive war against the Republic of Vietnam. Yet when the U.S. restored diplomatic relations with Hanoi under President Clinton, it fully recognized its sovereignty over the entire South. In another famous example, India invaded and annexed the sovereign Portuguese territory of Goa and other territories in 1961. While the United States strongly condemned this action, and scholars widely regard it is illegal, the international community eventually came to accept Indian sovereignty over the territory.The Vietnamese and Goan cases do not fit in any neat doctrinal boxes: their conquest was certainly illegal. But international law clearly allows, in practice, for some flexibility or nuance in applying the rule.There was some disagreement between leading authorities such as Hersch Lauterpacht and Robert Jennings on whether defensive conquest was proper under the UN Charter. The majority opinion seems to side with the permissive view, but both sides acknowledged that the matter was disputed, and a clear rule had not emerged.The lack of clarity is itself important, because in international law there is a meta-principle dealing with situations where it is not clear whether a rule has emerged. Known as the Lotus Principle, the rule is that when it is not clear whether an international law rule has emerged, states remain free to act. That is, the burden of proof is on those seeking to demonstrate the existence of a rule that would limit sovereign action. That which is not clearly prohibited is permitted.Many contemporary scholars argue against defensive conquest on policy grounds. Allowing for so-called defensive conquest would encourage countries to undertake aggressive campaigns of conquest under the pretext of self-defense. But self-defense is already clearly authorized by the U.N. Charter, and is frequently invoked as a pretext by aggressors. It is up to members of the international community, including the U.S., to exercise their judgement as to whether the underlying use of force is lawful.Many would say that Israels sovereignty over the Golan cannot be recognized. This effectively punishes the victim. One might say a reasonable and equitable rule would place the fault for failing to secure peace on the aggressor state after some period of time -certainly after 50 years C and thus waive any residual claim it has.Source: https://docs.house.gov/meetings/GO/GO06/20180717/108563/HHRG-115-GO06-Wstate-KontorovichE-20180717.pdf[Shamelessly stolen from Quora](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-illegal-for-a-country-to-annex-land-that-they-won-in-a-defensive-war)","title":"Syria plans $300 billion compensation demand from Iran over conflict damage"},{"text":"For the amount of money that California has spent in the last 28 years to build 0 km of operational HSR, China built 1150 km of operational HSR in 3 years.

Admittedly, my comment was a gross oversimplification.But I would argue that neither of the companies you mentioned could have achieved such dominance without government interference in the market.The biggest reason that they are able to merge with and acquire their smaller competitors is because of the ever-increasing cost of doing business due to the need to comply with federal and state regulations on minimum wage, occupational health and safety, environmental protection, etc. At a certain point, it becomes easier and more profitable for smaller businesses to sell out to their larger counterparts rather than continue to compete.Furthermore, these large global and national companies are not held to the same standards of regulation. Ive read plenty of articles about working conditions in Amazon warehouses and distribution centers; they do not paint the company in a positive light. But Amazon can afford the very best legal representation and corporate lobbyists to help them avoid the consequences. Imagine if a similar article was published about working conditions at a small local or regional company: that firm would get reamed by OSHA and the courts.The only potential solution is for the American people to exercise a combination of political pressure to deregulate on their elected representatives, and economic pressure by buying from smaller, more local businesses.

They have outposts on the border and missiles that they can fire directly into the heart of Gaza. Though the exact percentage changed over time, roughly 10% of Gaza was an exclusionary zone that would see Palestinian civilians shot and killed by Israeli soldiers for trespassing - shot and killed by Israelis on their side of the border, but shot and killed all the same. Israel also controlled all sorts of other things within Gaza prior to the most recent outbreak, such as banning Palestinian construction it didn't approve of on threat of bombing it if construction went ahead.Also at this point we know Israel's excuses aren't true, and it's just arguing over why. There is no evidence of Hamas activity for almost every single attack Israel launches and it uses the 0.1% of cases when Hamas are based in a hospital or whatever to justify their attacks on the other 99.9%. Now even though Israel has a proven history of lying whenever it thinks it can get away with it and whenever independent investigators have tried to analyse Israel's past attacks Israel has always been unwilling or unable to provide evidence to justify it's claims of Hamas presence; at this point even if you mindlessly accept Israel's claims it's still clear they're committing war crimes. Attacks must be proportionate. If you blow up a family, then there must be a proportionate military advantage gained by this action against legitimate targets like killing a squad of Hamas soldiers. Considering the death toll to civilians, if Israel were making attacks legally against real targets and the civilian deaths were an unfortunate but proportionate side effect of this, Hamas would be destroyed several times over.Israel is also the only side in the conflict to have been shown to use human shields. Human shields is the colloquial term for a specific set of actions banned in international military law. In previous Israeli/Palestinian clashes exactly the same type of actions we see now have occurred and the analysis of legal experts is that Hamas's actions don't constitute using human shields based on the usage in law of the verb \\"render\\" requiring Palestinians to take positive action to use civilians as shields, which they haven't done and which isn't met simply by the act of fighting in an urban environment where civilians will almost always be near. Israeli forces on the other hand are known and recorded to take action like chaining civilians, including civilians, to their vehicles to use as literal human shields or forcing civilians at gunpoint to set off suspected boobytraps which are clear violations of this law.In answer to your final question of how Israel should react, Israel should stop all war crimes it is committing. There is never any excuse for war crimes anyway, but in this case doing so would remove the core cause of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and it could quickly lead to peace or, if not, it would allow Israel to be far more effective against Hamas as it would both undermine the public support Hamas relies upon and allow Fatah to effectively collaborate with Israel against Hamas.","title":"CMV: What the Israelis are currently doing to the Palestinians is the same thing as the Nazis did to the Jews"},{"text":"He won the popular vote fucking vote.

They use this rhetorical strategy to try to avoid the moral disgust that many people feel towards Holocaust deniers, but upon examining many of their claims it is clear that their goal is indeed to deny the essential fact of the Holocaust: that approximately six million Jews were killed by the viciously antisemitic Nazi regime, including many in gas chambers. Pseudo-academic Holocaust deniers and white supremacist, antisemitic trolls alike dispute the fact that six million Jews were killed, often claiming that the actual death toll is much lower, and many deaths were due to diseases like typhus rather than large-scale systemic murder. They also dismiss or minimize the role of the gas chambers, arguing that it was scientifically and technically impossible for the Nazis to have killed that many Jews, and the gas chambers were not used for extermination.","title":"CMV: What the Israelis are currently doing to the Palestinians is the same thing as the Nazis did to the Jews"},{"text":"She represents my area.

I stand before you not as a predator, but as a patriot. I stand before you not as a beast, but as a believer in the values that make this country great. And let me tell you somethingI believe in action. I believe in results. And yes, I believe in accountability.*The crowd murmurs. A man in the front row raises his hand nervously.*Man in the Crowd:\\nUh, Mr. Leopard, sirwhat do you mean by accountability?Leopard Candidate:\\nAccountability, my friend, is about ensuring that those who have wronged this great nation face the consequences. Its about making sure that the people who have been feeding at the trough of corruption, who have been gnawing at the bones of our democracy, are held responsible. And let me be clear: when I say face the consequences, I mean it quite literally.*The crowd gasps. A woman in the back shouts out.*Woman in the Crowd:\\nWait, are you saying youre going to eat peoples faces?!Leopard Candidate:\\n[Chuckling, licking his chops] Now, now, lets not jump to conclusions. Im simply saying that there are certain individuals who have been taking advantage of hardworking Americans. And when Im elected, I will ensure that justice is served. Will some faces be eaten? Perhaps. But let me ask you this: dont you want a leader who isnt afraid to take a bite out of crime?*The crowd erupts into a mix of laughter, applause, and nervous whispers. A young man in a baseball cap raises his hand.*Young Man:\\nSir, can you at least tell us whose faces youre planning to eat? Like, is it going to be politicians? Lobbyists? People who dont recycle?Leopard Candidate:\\n[Grinning, showing just a hint of fang] My friend, I appreciate your curiosity. But lets not get bogged down in the details. Whats important is that I will protect you. I will protect your families, your jobs, and your way of life. And if that means I have to snack on a few bad apples along the way, then so be it. Rest assured, I will only eat the faces of those who truly deserve it.*An older woman in the crowd leans over to her friend and whispers loudly.*Older Woman:\\nI dont know, Martha. Hes got a point about the corruption, but Im not sure I want a president who might eat my face.Martha:\\nHonestly, Barbara, Id rather take my chances with the Leopard than another career politician. At least hes honest about what he is!Leopard Candidate:\\n[Pointing to Martha] Thank you, Martha! Thats the spirit! I may be a leopard, but Im a leopard you can trust. Im not here to play political games. Im here to get things done. And if that means I have to indulge in a little face-eating now and then, well, thats just the price of leadership.*The crowd cheers, though some still look uneasy. The Leopard Candidate raises his paw for silence.*Leopard Candidate:\\nSo, my fellow Americans, I ask for your support. Together, we can build a stronger, safer, and more prosperous nation. A nation where the guilty are punished, the innocent are protected, and the faces of the corrupt are deliciously dealt with. Thank you, and may God bless America!*The crowd erupts into applause as the Leopard Candidate steps away from the podium, licking his lips thoughtfully. The campaign slogan flashes on the screen behind him: LEOPARD 2024: A New Kind of Leadership.**Cut to a reporter interviewing a man in the crowd.*Reporter:\\nSir, are you really comfortable voting for a candidate who might eat peoples faces?Man in the Crowd:\\nLook, Im not saying its ideal, but at least hes upfront about it. Better than the other guys who just smile while they stab you in the back. Plus, hes got great tax policies.*The camera pans back to the Leopard Candidate, who is now shaking paws with supporters, his tail swishing confidently behind him.*Leopard Candidate:\\nRemember, folksvote Leopard.

Greed and entitlement. It seems we agree that the notions of the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness have been severely perverted over the years. The bar for 'happiness' (read also: success) has gone waaaay up from what it was under the New Deal or the America of modest suburban homes and an honest day's work. But humility has been replaced by competitiveness as a core American virtue - a process I am sure you can trace yourself. Trump shares the same modern perverse view that everything is a zero-sum game that the strong should 'win'. They see this as optimal, and axiomatic. Happiness leads to someone else's inevitable misery. Living means that others have to die. Freedom means that someone has to pay the price. I think we both find that distasteful. Although I am likely more cynical about Americans than you. To me, Trump is how entitlement and self-righteousness play out in the end. His soul is the same dark lump in the core of American culture. A glowing example of what it means to be a winner. He likely experienced real loss when Joe took away his plan to kill some prisoners. We can't be good in his view, unless a bad person swings from the end of a rope - preferably in a live-stream. That's the price of righteousness in the new America. In the end I do agree that this wasn't what your founders wanted. They just wanted to live a simple life without the King of England breathing down their necks. And for a few decades there, it was a good time. Maybe our better Angels will prevail. I hope they do.","title":"Trump vows to pursue executions after Biden commutes most of federal death row"},{"text":"I wanna congratulate you on increasing your neoliberal level.
