There are still 2.2 million people in Gaza today... should we forget that aid is currently being withheld from the area, which includes food, water, medical equipment, and fuel?  Should we forget that millions were told to shelter on the beach with no where to take a shit except for in the sand... and as the rainy season comes... what happens to that shit when the ground is covered in water.Women's rights are important... 100% ... but an ethnic cleansing leading to potentially hundreds of thousands dead, hundreds of thousands injured, potentially a million starved, and ultimately potentially millions forced off their land...AGAIN!... is also pretty GD important.It's funny you insist that this is a single issue...  usually the statement is \\"they think it's more important than abortion rights\\".   Seems to me, a lot of people voting Democrat are also single issue voters... women's reproductive rights being the issue.What I don't understand is what you think Harris will do about it?  Roe is gone, and the Supreme Court isn't going anywhere for the next 4 years, unless one suddenly dies, which even then, won't give the liberal justices a majority.  6 justices voted down Roe.  3 voted in defense of it.  This is now a state's issue, and I can't see how Trump would codify an abortion ban at the federal level without winning the presidency and having a majority in both houses of congress.  Something most analysts don't think is coming.  So am I willing to pause on this issue and triage the ongoing atrocity occurring in Gaza?  Yes I am.But ... have you ever considered that the Israel protest isn't just a single issue?  I don't think it's as simple as you're letting on.  If you care to read why I think that, then here you go.[https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1gjknnt/comment/lvg6cn5/?utm\\\\_source=share&amp;utm\\\\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\\\\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\\\\_term=1&amp;utm\\\\_content=share\\\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1gjknnt/comment/lvg6cn5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)Of course, I honestly don't think you or anyone else will read it.  People don't want the facts.  They don't want to think about complex issues... they want simple and easy black and white decisions.  To me, that's the embodiment of ignorance.Not that I want it to happen, or that I think it'll happen, but I could also tell you that strategically over the longer term, it makes more sense for Donald Trump to win this election and preside over the next 4 years as the economy weakens.  It's his last term; I very highly doubt he'll circumvent our Democracy.  Even if he were able to, the man's simply not gonna last much longer...  More likely is we have another election in 4 years... except if Trump does a horrible job as we all think he will, then it will give Democrats a real possible run at winning the presidency and both houses of congress in 2028.  Now if you want to codify abortion rights at the federal level.. then that is the only possible way to do it.Y'all like to say things like , \\"But Trump would level Gaza and be worse than Democrats\\".   When people say this, I know they haven't actually been following what's been happening in Gaza or spent a moment to look at how much damage has already been done.  Gaza has already been leveled.  The US has already supplied Israel with $18 billion in weaponry this year to finish leveling it.  We've put zero conditions on our aid to them.  If they run out of weapons, we'll just do another aid package.However, if the US allows this conflict to continue unabated... to allow Israel to continue to escalate this conflict in the middle east, then we could quickly find ourselves in a large scale war with Lebanon, Syria, and Iran simultaneously.  Another conflict that could resolve in hundreds of thousands of people killed.\\"But women's reproductive rights\\"... am'i'right?This is the problem with thinking so short term.  This is the issue with the real 'single issue voters'.  You never think beyond the current moment.  You never think about the entire picture.It really does beg the question... why are Democrats not moving on this issue when it's clear that a fairly hefty chunk of typical Democratic voters are saying they won't vote for Democrats, and may never vote for them again?  That in of itself is an additional issue to consider.  What is the force acting on the Democrats to enable them to support a genocide and to enable them to stop listening to the voters?You \\"think\\" it's just about Gaza.  You don't realize it's about the Democrat party as a whole, and in fact the entire US governmental system.","title":"Trump would be the worst: Palestinians react to US presidential race"},{"text":"They're really making the closing argument against themselves?\\n\\"We will crash the economy\\"\\n\\"We will put the brain worms trust fund kid in charge of your health\\"?\\nEtc\\nNever voted against someone so hard","title":"Trump indicates he is open to RFK Jrs proposal to ban vaccines if elected"},{"text":"\\"When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, Im basically the same.

For the last year, the World has watched this high-drama, low-truth shitshow. Like a dysfunctional family incapable of working together, engulfed in its privilege and vanity.  From the MAGA side, it's been a horrendous Wrestlemania-style  pantomime of horror, fueled by homophobia, racism, and misogynist evil. The Democrats have been slow and cumbersome in response. They might be right, but they did not address the threat effectively. Maybe that's unfair, it's difficult to counter the flood of constant, bizarre, hateful, manipulative bile.  But the process is so drawn out, so ludicrous, so unnecessary. It's like a media circus, rather than a reasoned democratic process. So much horror has happened in the World in the meantime, in Ukraine and the middle east, because America is distracted by a ridiculous drawn out media fueled drama. Bad-faith actors are running amok in the absence of a  confident American presence, hamstrung by this ludicrous election process. The World has, for a long time, extended a respect to the US as a moral and even military arbiter. That respect is under enormous threat. Another Trump administration will end it, without question. The dollar will not survive as the global reserve currency. Trump's tariff policy will inevitably destroy both it's budget and trade deficits. It's a populist and  clownish policy, which will inflict enormous costs on American families.  Vote that racist demented idiot out for good! The free World will not survive another term of that imbecile.","title":"Elon Musks random $1 million winners are pre-selected spokespeople for his pro-Trump PAC, lawyer admits"},{"text":"The Character and Eligibility of Donald Trump: A Critical Examination.This paper examines Donald Trumps character and constitutional eligibility to serve as president, focusing on the disqualification clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. Americas most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washingtons humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincolns moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trumps conductboth during his tenure and specifically on January 6threveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trumps character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384473246_The_Character_and_Eligibility_of_Donald_Trump_A_Critical_Examination/stats","title":"A pro-Trump influencer says a Russian agent paid him $100 to post a fake voter fraud video.

Shes extremely liberal, but she still gets a bit torqued off when she draws a gentle distinction of cis and trans women, and has been told were all women, and its like, yes, you are, but there is still a different lived experience. And just like trans women have it different and sometimes much worse than cis women, cis women do have different and sometimes worse experiences.?So basically she feels like trans women, while of course still valid and valued, are somewhat of forceful interlopers into womens experiences and spaces where it doesnt really make sense.

Although I am somewhat nervous, I feel somewhat confident that President Trump will win tomorrow. I just think that the voter pools used by many of the news outlets (to construct a viable \\"likely voter\\" model) is flawed. I believe that many pollsters are predicting an across-the-board turnout similar to 2020 (by rate rather than numbers). However, that election defied most election analysis conventions because of the pandemic. Even in November 2020, the local, state and national response to the pandemic resulted in an extraordinarily high number of voters at home. This included many schools and colleges being completely shut down. Younger voters were strongly in Biden's (and a rabid anti-Trump) camp. This is NOT the case in 2024. Everything is open. Student turnout (among high school seniors and college students) will probably be closer to what it was in 2016. The same is true of younger workers. If the polls are inaccurate due to overestimating the rate of 18-25 turnout, then I believe that this will shift the overall turnout and numbers in President Trump's favor.","title":"Final 2024 Electoral College and National Poll Predictions"},{"text":"Trump is a direct response to Nixon and Reagan getting off with committing grievous crimes (Watergate and Iran).

They decided that throwing the zealots a bone was worth preventing a Hillary Clinton presidency.

I'll give everyone what *they* want, and the rest of you can deal with it.\\" The only solace former party leadership gets with this is that for the most part, it turns out the moderate conservative base has been more willing to embrace the crazy than to vote democrat.

With early voting closed on Sunday and Monday, there is limited time for Democrats to overcome this turnout lead, so whether the state flips will likely come down to how many votes the party can get out on election day itself.**NV** - This is why we are skeptical of those peddling analysis supportive of a GOP landslide based on Nevadas early vote. Our model has the state at a 50-50 split, as of last night, and we see virtually no evidence in early voting to deviate from this.**PA** - On top of the fact that a smaller number of participating voters can be expected to turn out before election day than in years past, its also important to remember that the election day vote will almost certainly end up being much less Republican than in 2020.

There are quite a few issues rolled into this.  You can include out of control military spending.[U.S. Military Spending/Defense Budget 1960-2024](https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/USA/united-states/military-spending-defense-budget)  (Highest on record)You can include the Israel lobby that seems to be directing the US' Israel policy using funding from the unknowing US taxpayer, laundered through Israel in our multi-billion dollar aid packages.  Did any of y'all know the US taxpayer has funded Israel to the tune of about $350 billion... that we know of?  That doesn't even include direct US military intervention on Israel's behalf in the region.  It doesn't include purchases of Israeli military technology and spying insights... no doubt at a pretty hefty upcharge.You can include Iraq.  Is everyone in here unaware that Israel was heavily lobbying the US to attack Iraq in 2002, just prior to the US invasion?  That war is said to have cost the US between $1 trillion and $3 trillion, lead to the death of thousands of US soldiers, and hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis.  I'm sure if I looked into it a little further, it'd become evident that Israel had some major financial benefits come from that war.Have we noticed what Israel was doing right now?  They're escalating conflicts with Lebanon and Iran, and have been for some time now lobbying the US to attack Iran.  Would anyone here like the US to get involved in another multi-trillion dollar multi-year war that leaves hundreds of thousands of more civilians dead?And these are just the issues with this administration that relate to Israel.  What about US policies like hiring shit tons of government workers to prop up the economy?  Government workers, generally, aren't very productive in the long term, save for education.   Where I think many of those jobs are coming from are military and weapons production.  Ironically, we have to supply the weapons to Israel, which is paid for by US taxpayers... so taxpayers are massively funding the US military industrial complex.  Again, no doubt at a nice premium for those companies.Democrats have lead us much deeper into debt.  Outside of the pandemic, we're currently sitting at the highest deficit number on record... during what's claimed to be a hot economy, and that's after counting inflation.  Typically in hot economies, the deficit is near its record lows.  That absolutely is not the case today.  Sure, Republicans are often just as bad, if not worse... but that doesn't absolve Democrats.How about Elon Musk? We all love Elon Musk around here, right?  Y'all do realize who passed the policies to subsidize and prop up Musk's companies and his wealth right?  The IRA was one of the largest handouts to a single auto company in the history of the automotive industry.  It doesn't take a genius to look at where the lion's share of the EV tax credit money went to.  It went to Tesla just as they started to see their demand drop off a cliff in the US and their car inventories start to build.  Musk's company was in trouble, so the Democrats bailed him out.How about SpaceX?  It seems like SpaceX has become a bottomless pit in terms of government funding.  It also seems the government has been more than willing to allow him to launch as many Starlink satellites as he wants, which not only gives SpaceX a huge competitive advantage in global internet service, but also potentially creates a massive anti-Trust issue if this leads to other providers folding, or trying to launch their own satellite constellation.  Who's going to launch their satellites for them?  Their direct competitor??We're all pissed about Elon Musk using his immense wealth to influence politics... but it was the Democrats that built his power and his wealth... and even after the man has attacked Democrats, they still continued to support him and his companies with the IRA and new massive grants to SpaceX.  The Democratic party helped create the devil by picking a corporate winner and telling investors \\"we won't let this company fail, so you're free to invest and hyperinflate the stock, and make its CEO and largest shareholder the richest man on the planet\\".  Must turned around and used his new found wealth to support Republicans.So no... this isn't just a single issue.The problem with you tribalist Democrats is you presumed it was only one issue and attacked people for having that single issue.

They are all hedging in favor of Trump because they fucked up 2016 and 2020, and they are afraid to be wrong again, and in doing so, they are probably going to be wrong again.In addition to that, 150 right-wing polls (some based out of Brazil of all places) have been plopped into the numbers this year to intentionally skew the averages in favor of Trump. 75 (seventy-fucking-five) of them have been dropped in the last 8 days alone in an attempt to offset Kamalas gathering momentum.FiveThirtyEights answer to this is We weight the right wings polls, which is really fucking stupid because they are being released to skew the polling results.

Harris has the support of 51 percent of likely voters to Trumps 47 percent C a lead just outside the polls 3.5-point margin of error. A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris. It has been and remains a close election, said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. As far as the popular vote is concerned, its hers to lose. The 2024 campaign has been shaped by dramatic events unlike any other election year in modern American history: the sitting president and presumptive Democratic nominee withdrawing from the race less than four months before Election Day; the first woman of color nominated as a major party candidate; two assassination attempts on the Republican nominee; and the same nominee convicted on 34 felony charges. Despite all that, likely voters surveyed in this poll greatly resemble the 2020 electorate, which backed President Joe Biden with 51 percent of the popular vote to Trumps 47 percent. Weve gone through all of this to get back topretty much where you ended up four years ago, Miringoff said. Well see if the Electoral College mirrors that. Behind the topline numbers, Miringoff noted some shifts at the margins that explain the coalitions lining up behind the two candidates and why polling continues to show a close race. Most notably: The gender gap has shrunk in half in the last month of the campaign. Trump has held onto his lead among men, but it has shrunk to 4 points, down from the 16-point advantage he had over Harris in October. At the same time, 55 percent of women say they will back Harris in the latest survey. The vice presidents lead among women has shrunk from 18 points to 11 points since last month. The gender split in this poll is nearly identical to the one between Biden and Trump in 2020, according to AP VoteCast surveys of the electorate. When it comes to race, however, the latest poll finds a slight reshaping of support for the two candidates since the last presidential election. Trump leads Harris 54 percent to 45 percent among white voters, but her 9-point deficit is a slight improvement over the 12-point advantage Trump had with this group in 2020. Harris instead has seen some erosion among Black and Latino voters, who together made up about 20 percent of the vote in 2020. Harris has support from 83 percent of likely Black voters and 61 percent of likely Latino voters C down 8 and 2 points, respectively, from the share that supported Biden in 2020. In the vice presidents closing argument to voters in recent weeks, she has emphasized reaching out to Republican voters who are disillusioned with Trump and tried to remind them of the chaos she said came with his time in the White House. Harris has campaigned in swing states with prominent Republican officials who have endorsed her, including former Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kingzinger. The PBS News/NPR/Marist survey suggests her efforts may be working. Eight percent of Republicans say they will vote for Harris, up 3 points from a month ago and double the number of Democrats who say they will back Trump. In a close race, thats a big deal potentially, Miringoff said. More than 78 million ballots have already been cast, according to the University of Florida Election Lab. Fifty-five percent of likely voters in this poll report already having cast a ballot. One-third of voters say they plan to vote in person on Election Day, including 40 percent of Trump supporters. Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 42 percent. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53 percent plan to vote for Trump; while 45 percent support Harris. Polls released in the waning hours of presidential elections often receive outsized attention C including a Des Moines Register poll over the weekend that showed Harris with a 3-point lead over Trump in Iowa, and a trio of Marist polls at the end of last week that found Harris leading Trump in the Blue Wall states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. But both Democrats and Republicans are quick to point out that what matters is the results after voting ends on Tuesday. Miringoff offers a similar word of caution to poll-obsessed political observers. If you want to know who is going to win and who is going to carry every state, thats not what this is going to tell you. It just tells you that the advantage is hers going in, Miringoff said. The polls have been continuing to monitor just how polarized the nation is. One of the widest chasms between likely Trump and Likely Harri voters are their reasons for showing up to the polls and the belief about what will happen after voting concludes. A majority of Harris supporters (51 percent) say their highest-priority issue when deciding who to vote for is preserving democracy. More than a third list abortion as their second most important issue. For Trump supporters the biggest issues are inflation and immigration. After voting ends and a winner is named, 71 percent of likely voters say that if their chosen candidate is the loser, he or she should accept the results. Twenty-seven percent say the losing candidate should challenge the results in that scenario. Trump has continued to spread baseless lies that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. He told the audience at one of his final campaign rallies Sunday in Pennsylvania that he shouldnt have left the White House after his loss to Biden. He has similarly begun to lay the groundwork to challenge the 2024 election results if he loses. Forty-three percent of his supporters believe he should challenge the results of the election if he loses. Thirteen percent of Harris supporters say the same. In preparation for Election Day, fencing has gone up around the White House and Capitol, and many commercial buildings in downtown Washington have been boarded up in anticipation of potentially violent demonstrations. Seventy-two percent of likely voters are concerned about violence as a result of the election. That includes 85 percent of Harris supporters and 57 percent of Trump supporters.","title":"Harris has 4-point lead over Trump in final PBS News/NPR/Marist election poll"},{"text":"Damn, good question.

His Own Party Disagrees."},{"text":"Preach on.Fact is, there are a lot of single issue voters in here.  The primary issue I hear in response to those protesting against voting for an administration that's actively, as in right now, supporting a genocide, is women's reproductive rights.Well, hate to break this to everyone, but Roe's gone and it ain't coming back.  It's now up to the states to decide on abortion, which has little to do with the president, and is often voted on by the people of the state as ballot proposals.  In those cases where the state congress and governor has decided to push foward with their own legislation, the people can still override that with proposals or vote out their legislature.It's pretty interesting that Biden insisted that if he wins the next election he'll codify Roe.  I assume Harris is making the same claim.  The question is how.  If they don't win the presidency and both houses of congress, then it ain't happening.  Worse, if they win, and the country goes into a financial recession, then that typically results in the party in charge at the time losing the next election cycle in a huge way.  Meaning, Democrats can not only NOT move forward with codifying abortion rights, but they'll lose the next election in a big way, which could possibly make the situation even worse.And as you said, unless the Democrats are intentionally trying to lose or believe the protest vote isn't big enough to deter their win, then those people refusing to vote for a pro-genocide Democratic candidate aren't an issue anyways.  If Harris loses, it'll be because she either intended to lose, and intended to alienate those protestors,  or she made a major miscalculation in choosing to hold strong on this administration's and the Democratic Party's pro-genocidal stance.Frankly, having spent a lot of time following this ethnic cleansing, and reviewing the history of this conflict... and after having been insulted by the leftists by being called an anti-Semite for protesting against Israel's actions... there's one thing that still drives me quite nuts; when the left claims they'll continue pushing forward with a two-state solution.  Do we all realize that claims of pursuing a two-state solution go all the way back to 1947?  They've been at it for 77 years now... it's not gonna happen.For anyone paying attention, Israel has done two things fairly recently:1. They've dotted the West Bank with ILLEGAL Israel settlements, making that land essentially impossible to host a Palestinian state.  The Israel government has been assisting them in this both financially and militarily.  The US has done nothing to stop it.  In fact, many of the settlers are Americans.  Even if Palestinians were given a state, are we claiming that the settlement growth will just stop, and won't continue proceeding illegally?\\n2. They've essentially destroyed Gaza.  Completely flattened it.  Which is ironic to hear people claim \\"but Donald Trump has promised to flatten Gaza\\".  Uh... HELLLOOO everyone, have you not seen the photos?  Have you not seen the videos?  Gaza IS flattened.  Over 2% of the entire population has been killed.  Over 4% injured/maimed.Of course most of y'all haven't been paying attention... you can't be bothered to actually take the time and look at what's happening there.  You can't be bothered to understand why so many people are SO disturbed by what OUR government has enabled that we can't, in good conscience, vote for them this election, and possibly never again....Have we never considered that maybe this 'single issue' is a big deal?","title":"Trump would be the worst: Palestinians react to US presidential race"},{"text":"Take nothing for granted.

Trump was leading the charge on the Obama birthed conspiracy Yes he was, without a doubt.The Tea Party was the right wing movement of this populist anger at the government following the financial crisis.Was there plenty of racism and general disdain for liberal elites mixed in on top of the more reasonable populist gripe? *Yes, of course there was*.But the Tea Party populist backlash that divided both the Republican and Democrat parties at the end of the Obama years doesnt happen if (a) Obama held bankers accountable, and (b) economic recovery was more even and felt by those in more depressed areas, not just rich coastal areas.Would Trump have tried racist birther stuff? Yeah probably, but I doubt he would have gotten as far. We were gonna build a wall to keep the Mexicans out Yes, Trump scapegoated immigrants and had no real plan to fix the issue. Yes, building a wall is a stupid solution the problem.That said, many border towns are feeling the cost of undocumented immigration - and immigration from the developing world has surged in Europe &amp; Canada too with major backlash.

It's likely the GOP won't have another president for the next 20 years after trump.trump has hijacked the GOP with a radical approach, and career politicians don't like radical.

It gave them license to talk about their biases openly and blatantly in the name of telling it like it is, and to willfully ignore facts in the name of institutional skepticism.Reagan took away welfare, went after unions, stripped environmental policy and regulations in the name of institutional reform. He started using migrants as scapegoats while adding more regulation to immigration policy - making it even more difficult to be legal (Nixon did this, too if I recall). HW followed suit. W said he is compassionate, that he'll work on helping them, but also more tightly enforced things, stripped away institutional power, etc. The Tea Party pushed that message more. Then Trump rolled down an escalator and *in his campaign opening speech* proclaimed Mexicans were rapists.All the while the press tried to both sides and \\"give equal consideration and time\\" while ignoring the truth of the plight of the poor, the immigrants, the minorities, etc. They spent the Trump presidency treating the Trump voters like sociological wonders to make them feel like they have a voice.We need facts.

Something seemed off about it. Idk how long it lasted, seemed like forever, but after a bit I completely freaked out because she talked to me in the dream. Now the reason I freaked out was because my wife is Japanese and this dream wife spoke perfect English, so I knew immediately that it wasnt her. In response I tried to scream for my wife. I remember trying as hard as I could to scream her name but it was like my mouth was forced shut like in that horrible scene in the matrix. I was finally able to get out a sound and woke up absolutely horrified. Couldnt move my body for about 5-10 minutes. Idk if it meant anything or if she was a demon or whatever, but I could easily see someone thinking it was some kind of paranormal phenomenon or something because it was terrifying.

Wade never happened. There's been so much talk about how women are out to vote because of it, but is there so much voter apathy that we would be staring down the barrel of another Trump presidency had the Supreme Court not buried Roe v. Wade?Quite possibly. People are generally far more motivated by being personally impacted at an existential level. What was driving a lot of the culture war in the late sixties and early seventies was the draft and Vietnam. As soon as we got out of Vietnam and successfully deposed a President the wind left the sails of 'the Movement'. Nixon had been duly punished by 'the people' and no one was being personally threatened by the possibility of being drafted and sent to Vietnam to die in the jungles for some abstract idea like \\"making the world safe for democracy\\". The thing about abortion is that it's as existential for women as Vietnam was for men. It's a decision that no woman comes to lightly. They may not like abortion and they may not want to abort but they see no other choice under the circumstances (circumstances that are almost totally a result of external pressures). The freedom to choose was always there if you had to resort to. Publically you could say how awful it is etc but it's still a safety valve if you need it. And it has been there for 50 years. Generations of women have grown up assuming that the right to choose will be there if they need it.My hope is that an Equal Rights Amendment will be the unanticipated result of the Republican/Christian dog catching the car being driven by liberated women.","title":"Hes realizing that he could lose: Harriss people are confident.

It's not even clear that they're wrong. \\nThe Attorney General office civil rights division has authority to send election monitors to monitor civil rights in polling places.   It's not a criminal statute. THe remdy would be contempt of court or at the extreme, federal authorities compelling compliance. However, more importantly. The Supreme Court broke the law several years ago and I needs to be fixed. There were two bases for legal Authority for the election observers. The first basis is if the election observers were appointed by a federal court.  There are only two states where the AG currently ahs a federal court case to appoint observers. Alaska and Louisiana. The other basis is if the Attorney General had designated those particular jurisdictions as requiring observation pursuant to a history of past racial discrimination. However, in *Shelby County v Holder* the Supreme Court invalidated section 4A of the Voting Rights Act requiring special supervision of states that had engaged in past racial discrimination as violating equal protections.  So the AG can no longer do that.  So the issue is that while the Attorney General's office can still send out these election observers, they only have the authority to compel compliance if they convince a federal court to order it. There is no federal court case ordering federal monitors in Missouri or Texas. The states have seized on the exception and sought State Court rulings saying that they do not have to cooperate with the federal election observers. This is in lieu of actually asking law enforcement to bar them or some such which likely would have been a lot more controversial.It's another thing to fix if they win authority.","title":"Some Republican-led states refuse to let Justice Department monitors into polling places"},{"text":"If you have to keep telling everyone you are smart it's because you aren't.

My bad for jumping to conclusions. But flat earth does have a big Christian influence. It also gets twisted into the whole Jesus already came back 1000 years ago conspiracy theory that states were now living under the dominion of Satan. I can honestly see why a Christian would think that tho, given that organized religion is losing its momentum and popularity. But I think thats just the natural course of humanity. Or maybe the Zodiac long calendar has more of an impact then we realize. Jesus ruled Pisces. Its why Jesus is always represented with a fish. But earth is now out of Pisces and into Aquarius. The age of Aquarius supposedly brings scientific rationalism and is the end of religion being the opiate of the masses. Which I think anyone would agree, seems to be happening. Crowley called it the Aeon of Horus. Crowley claimed the Aeon of Horus would be recognized when the lines between gender start to blur (trans movement, maybe?). People will become scared of the sky/weather (fear of climate change?). A period of growing individual consciousness and a shift towards new spiritual and psychological paradigms. He thought this Aeon began in 1904 but personally the year 2000 makes more sense. Either way, its pretty evident were on the cusp of a new time in humanity. Our world is so vastly different then the one that came before us. Religious dogmas and organized religions stronghold on humanity is crumbling and Im all for it. Bishop rule destroyed Christianity early on and corrupted any good Christianity might have had to offer. Its mind boggling to think how much the world has changed in the past 100 years let alone the last 2000 years. I believe mastering The ability to harness electricity was the beginning of the end for the old world. Tesla claimed to be harnessing the power of the pyramids when making his Tesla towers and that he was tapping into a kind of Yungian collective consciousness to obtain the knowledge. Makes ya wonder.

He wasn't their long-awaited conservative Messiah.

They want out from under him just as much as Democrats do, because they know this path isn't sustainable, and they'll eventually pay the political price for riding the MAGA train.  trump dragged them on that train in the first place, kicking and screaming.  JD Vance called him America's Hitler.  I could go on and on about how mainstream Republicans warned us about him.And consider this: where's trump's lieutenant/heir apparent?  There's not one.  I'm not pretending that I can explain why trump appeals to these people the way he does, *but it's just him.*  Look at what happened to DeSantis in the primaries.  He was a big fish in Florida, but nationally MAGAs hated him.  They *hated* him, and all the other primary contenders, *because they weren't trump.*  trump didn't even have to debate.Why was that?  By your calculus, all someone would have to do to defeat trump would be to act even more extreme.  You could theoretically out-MAGA trump, and beat him at his own game.  But that doesn't happen, even after trump has lost an election and is nearly 80 years old.  DeSantis is more extreme than trump.  MTG is more extreme.  And plenty of other people could easily step up and be an even bigger buffoon and spew even more hateful rhetoric.  But it doesn't work.  *Because they're not trump.*What is happening with trump is a psychological phenomenon, not a political one.

You want an example at the federal level? How about when Chuck Schumer warned Trump that the intelligence agencies had \\"six ways from Sunday to get back at\\" any president who dared to cross them. In other words, a bipartisan admission that these agencies have amassed so much power and have gone rogue and no longer answer to the elected head of the civilian federal executive as they are required to by law.

And yet their model gives Harris MI 58% of the time and WI 57%.So I'm not sure how it is that the single most predicted outcome is one in which one part of it statistically should also only happen ~33% of the time.Either way the obvious and blatant poll herding and flooding of low quality republican polls is making all this poll analysis completely pointless. 538's simply not compensating for either in significant numbers.My theory is that's partially pollsters scared to death (from death threats) of undercounting Trump in 2016, and partially an intentional effort to make it easier for the right to froth their supporters into a frenzy when the numbers don't come close to matching the polls. She gets 300 EV and they'll say \\"there must be fraud, despite all odds nearly every single poll said she had exactly a 50% chance of winning!\\"","title":"Harris camp thinks shes regained edge on Trump"},{"text":"He's been wrong about market demand, product, and pricing strategy in every other business he's ever owned.","title":"Trump warns voters that his second term would get nasty at times"},{"text":"But then couldn't Americans just make their own local business to fill demand? which is the whole point.

I wouldn't mind paying the high inflation prices we have now if that meant people had job security. One thing I seen about the Smoot-Hawley Act is that Factory payrolls increased significantly. It's possible we could outweigh the cost increases if this is done correctly. Taking into account that if we got rid of federal taxes, that would also be more money in our pockets. And I'm sure somebody will say, \\"the tariffs act contributed to the Great depression!!\\" But many conservative and liberal economists during that time disagreed and said was inconclusive to think it played such a huge part in the Great Depression. The Wall Street crash had already happened before the Act was enacted. Popular economists like Milton Freeman contributed the Great Depression to the Federal Reserve(END THE FED) and the central role of the money supply.On a side note, Ron Paul possibly taking a role in the administration and this information makes it seem much more exciting.","title":"Trump says Federal Taxes are a scam.

They support him as a form of retribution against those who have tried to trample on their beliefs or their own convictions.Many of those who vote for Trump do so out of impulse or a feeling of anger, wanting to be heard.

The world is fixated on the result of Tuesdays vote  even if Washington doesnt call all the shots any more, it still calls plenty.Americas vibrant economy remains the worlds biggest and its politicians  especially Trump  have shown theyre ready to weaponize it.

Also recognize, leftists represent a variety of demographics. Personally, I know more of the queer community to lean left further than not, and considering were all scared of a second Trump term, were voting for the option that doesnt rebrand a portion of us as pedophiles who deserve to be executed.Now, if you think we are a significant enough number of voters that wed throw an entire election, why arent you more pissed at Kamala for not throwing single issue pro-Palestine leftists a bone? All she needs to do is play lip service with leftists at the least to get a vote, so why cant she even bother doing that if she wants to defeat Trump? It would be like if she was for keeping abortion up to the states, and every left-wing woman in the US gets outraged that shes not doing enough to earn their vote on the one thing. People would think shes a dumb ass for not pursuing that demographic, but then imagine you have a bunch of hardline democrats telling you youre a fucking idiot if youre not voting for Kamala because your alternative is worseI think that these leftists youre complaining about are an insignificant part of the voting population that youve chosen to over generalize to a point where I personally start finding it borderline offensive toward the majority of us that are probably just grumbling while we vote for someone who does not represent our class interests.And when you choose to make leftists your boogeyman for losing the election, you fall into the hands of the people in power who have money by choosing to infight with a segment of the population who has more in common ideologically than right-wingers do instead of focusing on the people in power wronging us all.

The fact that Trump is from the non-governing party doesn't really play into this election. The fact that he as a person is uniquely tainted in perpetuity should explain quite easily why he's not running away with it.

Trump said that at his own rally.Harris had the same energy and momentum the author had observed from other rallies.

(I'm a bot)\\n**\\n Trump has been holding his signature rallies since he first burst on the political scene in 2015, and in the nine years since has routinely drawn massive and enthusiastic crowds around the country, from the urban cores to the remote rural fields, where supporters have consistently shown up despite sometimes icy conditions or extreme heat. At several of the rallies, the crowds began to thin out more as Trump was still speaking - something he&amp;#039;s been defensive about in the past, including during his Sept. 10 debate with Harris.

It's a regressive taxation, where the poor pay more than the rich, in percentage of their income.EDIT: For people that are claiming \\"not if you buy domestic\\", it's impossible to eliminate import and global trade, and domestic producers will INCREASE their price to maximize profit (again, a regressive taxation).

How many people die from preexisting medical conditions when they are kicked off their health insurance?  I said I'm against modern warfare because the loss of life is usually civilian for the last 100 years.  But we aren't living in a perfect world -  we are living in a world with nuclear weapons-  not every leader of every country is actually able to manage a responsibility so horrific.So go add up the loss of life in the wars in the middle east for the last 20 years only.  Don't bother with the last 2000 years just deal with the last 20 years.  Helping an ally is not the same thing as being an aggressor.  Putin threw an all female band in prison for 2 years because rhey staged a musical protest at an orthodox church that was supporting his campaign.  He kills moderates and has been expanding Russia.  Expansion is aggression.  Helping an ally isn't the same thing as aggressive expansion.  So if 79 million boomers got kicked off their health insurance by Republicans STILL trying to gut AND KILL the ACA and let's say 10 million of them had untimely deaths from that in the next few years -  wtf is that?!  Is that the same as 1-2 million people dying in war in the middle east in the last 20 years? They both suck in certain ways yes.  But one party has the alt left calling for an end to genocide.  Moderates at the UN are calling for bibi to stop.  Look what rhe taliban is doing to women?  12 million women locked in their homes.  Feminists are saying this equates to gendered SLAVERY because rhe woman is the domestic servant of rhe man, not allowed to speak to other w omen and not allowed to move freely in society without her male guardian. Feminists are saying that's WORSE than apartheid because in apartheid at least the abused race is not tied to one domestic master and is allowed to operate in society even though they are being oppressed in a horrific way too.So go ahead and say there's no difference in the two parties but it means you didn't do a real body count -  you didn't really look at a body count or the fact that no the taliban cannot handle certain technological capabilities that other countries are managing right now.  We want the party with the lowest body count in my opinion","title":"Kremlin warns Trump 'may face JFK-style assassination' if he tries to end war."},{"text":"There was a mini riot at the Mankato meet up with Perdue in 2018 after the administration took over soy crop production.

Trump did not have an administrative team or any policies to speak of at the time because he ran on a narcissistic whim for self-promotion, not expecting to win.After winning the primary, he gained the support of the Council for National Policy by promising, for example, to give them their justice picks and use extremists from the CNP in key positions within his administration. The CNP never had so much wide-ranging, direct access before so they enthusiastically adopted Trump as their imperfect vessel and directed their member groups to fall in line and support him.New Republic - [A Rare Peek Inside the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy](https://newrepublic.com/article/167002/council-national-policy-documents-right-wing-conspiracy)Together, the organizations would serve as a three-legged stool for the right, with Heritage [Foundation] as the think tank; [American Legislative Exchange Council] as a state-level bill mill; and the [Council for National Policy] as a coordinating body for donors, media, and activists.Washington Post - [God, Trump and the Closed-Door World of a Major Conservative Group](https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2021/10/25/god-trump-closed-door-world-council-national-policy/)In October 2015, Donald Trump was still a laugh line for right-wing Christian activists. By their lights he was a failed casino owner and thrice-married playboy. He had no apparent principles, no policy blueprint and no grasp of the Bible. He didnt even understand free-market theory, something they consider to be a fountainhead of American liberty. Yet here he was in a conference room at the Ritz-Carlton in McLean, Va., soliciting support from a closed-door group of conservative leaders called the Council for National Policy.For months after the event, Dannenfelser and some other CNP members were determined to stop Trump. While he solidified his lead as GOP front-runner, they denounced him as a charlatan in the conservative magazine National Review, blasted his prior support of abortion rights and implored Republican voters to choose another candidate.Then came a great swerve that would upend politics in America: Millions of conservatives  Dannenfelser and other CNP members among them  got firmly behind Trump.McGahn thought Trump could benefit by releasing a list of nominees to replace Scalia, an unusual move that would reassure religious and social conservatives who wanted an anti-abortion jurist. Trump expressed support for one of Leos long-cherished goals: a federal court system dominated by judges who would interpret the Constitution in ways that favored business and conservative views.In the summer of 2016, Trump made another strategic move that would seal the deal with Dannenfelser, the anti-abortion activist, and other CNP members. He pledged to oppose abortion and put the promises onto paper in September. Dear Pro-Life Leader, Trumps letter began. I am writing to invite you to join my campaigns Pro-Life Coalition, which is being spearheaded by longtime leader Marjorie Dannenfelser. Trump said he would nominate pro-life justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, defund Planned Parenthood and take other measures that the anti-abortion activists had demanded.Dannenfelser was thrilled. Before that we were still stomping our feet, she said last year at a CNP meeting, according to one of the internal videos. Little did we know that this man, who was a performer and can incite audiences in ways we never even thought could be, would galvanize audiences in battleground states all over the country and put life at the center of the project. The CNP crowd whooped and hollered at her remarks.In Reeds book, he writes that Dannenfelser told him: Trump was my last choice until he was my first.Washington Spectator - [How the CNP, a Republican Powerhouse, Helped Spawn Trumpism, Disrupted the Transfer of Power, and Stoked the Assault on the Capitol](https://washingtonspectator.org/nelson-cnp/)Operating from the shadows, [the Council for National Policys] members, who would number some 400, spent the next four decades courting, buying, and bullying fellow Republicans, gradually achieving what was in effect a leveraged buyout of the GOP.In 2016, the CNP put its partners money, data, and ground game behind Donald Trump, as the ultimate transactional candidate. Trump promised it retrograde social policies, a favorable tax regime, regulatory retreats, and its choice of federal judges. He delivered in spades. By 2020, the leaders of the CNP were ready to go to extreme lengths to keep himand themselvesin power.Donald Trump remained a dependable ally, asking only for an audience for his megalomania and a free pass for the business interests of the Trump brand. In return, he delivered his dynamism and his unshakeable base.Ultimate realization of the CNPs agenda depended on winning a second term for Trump in November. With another four years, it could enshrine its socially regressive policies on the federal level, further blur the line between church and state, and consolidate huge windfalls for corporations and wealthy individuals.","title":"Trump Promises to Bring About a New Era of Christian Power"},{"text":"Nephew response.
