Ive felt like happenstances such as maintenance men working or when I describe door locks sounding like gunshots are one thing covering up for another happening on another plane or so. Like of like how you may have been asleep or drifted and speaking to a person or looking at something to wake up and realize it is your lamp for example.This may or may not be exactly such experiences or the case of being locked into a chakra. The root chakra is a baser one with focuses on basic survival and the like iirc. It should not be out of wack or like any other you may experience perhaps just what we are describing and literally may be locked into not being able to receive and maintain positive experiences, or can do so with more difficulty. This is my take as the body and mind are of course connected, things like unnecessary circumcision and lasting physical ailments are ways this may add to that. Its funny Robert talks about hearing a loud pop at some point when one goes to astral project. I dont know about say reality switching or changing your general frequency but the oh so convenient noises and feels I experience are as I mention around when I am just getting somewhere good inside. I wont stop meditating on the good though. Mark 11:24 describes how to manifest via prayer the right way and it isnt just asking but believing you have received it already. Neville Goddard similarly describes mitigating you are experiencing and seeing what you aim for through your eyes.","title":"Public housing loosh harvesting"},{"text":"Covid was already in china by then, thats how they knew","title":"How did 4Chan know?"},{"text":"hey thats still here today!","title":"Joe Biden addresses Americas original sin of slavery on Angola visit"},{"text":"VA-Gov Mark Warner, leading contender for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination as of early 2005.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 4, 2024"},{"text":"Exactly.

Toxic masculinity has never really been addressed as a social issue of gender expectations the same way that we addressed the oppressive expectations around femininity. The general attitude from liberals and leftists is figure out how to be better on your own, when clearly these are young men who need help.Boys and young men are lagging behind in all kinds of educational outcomes, from dropout rates to disciplinary issues to grades to college enrollment. They still face expectations of toxic masculinity from their families and communities. They present with mental health issues in different patterns than girls and young women while also struggling more to ask for help. As communities become more fragmented and individualized, they lack positive male role models and a sense of connection to others in their own lives, and the right jumps on that as an opportunity to radicalize them. Instead of discussing any of these issues (which the right constantly does), our side seems to just dismiss them. Either theyre man-children (which would mean we are failing to help our boys and young men deal with emotions in a healthy way) or its an assumption that theyre sexist and cruel by nature, which is just sexist. Both of these attitudes are going to drive them away, no one likes being talked down to.For some reason, we dont apply the systemic analysis towards understanding toxic masculinity the way we do sexism against women or racism, even though its also a social construct.","title":"President AOC?

I think this gives conservatives a ton of ways to respond to constant attacks and pretty much destroys some of their favorite talking points.  I also think that just as democrats hardly ever think about the unintended consequences of their actions, this will come back to haunt them down the line.As for deflecting attacks and destroying taking points, we can now ask when they use one of their goto fair share, gun grabber arguments or talking point: Well, please explain why the head of your party who constantly bashes people to pay their fair share and talks endlessly about lax gun laws, just pardoned someone who plead guilty of not paying taxes and violating gun laws?  There are a lot of legal implications to the pardon.  Hunter can now be called to testify about his dealings during the timeframe and cannot take the 5th! If he lies, he opens himself up to a charge of perjury which is not covered by the pardon.  If Congress refers him to the DOJ for such a thing, I dont think Pam Bondi will blink twice before she goes after him.

They both had problems with messaging (Hillary herself has said this about Democrats in 2016) when voters wanted to hear a clear story about change. They both had been rejected by the primary process before, with Hillary losing to an inexperienced black man with the middle name Hussein in a much less diverse country than today. Then in the 2016 primary, 43% of the party went for an Independent senator with virtually no name recognition and little party support. This was after polls in 2014 showed her to be the most favorable candidate on either side with a 55% approval. Then in the 2016 general, she lost to Trump. The common thread is that she came across as a status quo pragmatist when people wanted a clear story of why the economy wasnt working for them and what would change. Harris went to the right of Biden to be more business-friendly while trying to blame corporate greed for the high cost of living and never giving clear answers about what she would do differently than him when asked in multiple interviews. Data shows she stopping discussing her own economic policies by the end and Trump was talking about the high cost of living more than twice as often as her. All while voters said the economy was their most important issue. She made a lot of errors by dodging the issue voters cared about most.Biden won during some of the worst of covid, when 80% of Americans blamed Trumps government for the situation and were also unhappy with the economy. He had very strong advantages.The worst takeaway from the last few elections is that the country isnt ready for a woman.

The French Constitution (currently) says that elections cannot be called for a full year following the most recent election, except in the circumstance where a President steps down or passes away. So, as long as Macron remains in office (his term doesn't expire until 2027), the parliamentary elections cannot be 'redone' until Summer 2025 at the earliest.2. You may or may not be correct. Macron's center-right party has been losing power, but part of why the far-right doesn't control parliament outright at the moment is that the left coalition and the left members of Macron's Ensemble worked together to only run one of them in certain districts so that La Pen's party couldn't win seats with 40% of the total vote -- Macron was explicitly against this.Whatever the outcome of the next election, it will not be better for Macron than the last ones. The big question is what the slow death of Ensemble means for the left and right parties; Do the more center-left members work with the left coalition again? Do some of them swap parties outright? After a year of absolute chaos, how many of the center-right members of Ensemble lose their seats to the far right as their voters get annoyed at the gridlock? The same question of the center-left members of Ensemble.Who do the French people blame for all this? Ensemble, certainly, because this mess is squarely at Macron's feet -- But what that means to the voters in each district come next summer (or Macron's resignation) is harder to say.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 4, 2024"},{"text":"Yahtzee!","title":"Why do you need a pardon if the justice system is above reproach?"},{"text":"Pretty funny when Snopes is citing Libs of TikTok.","title":"Biden Repeatedly Said He Would Not Pardon His Son, Hunter | Snopes, Correct Attribution ?"},{"text":"Anyone else see the Ottawa ad blitz:For generations, this ally to the North has been by your side: Ontario, Canada, a partner connected by shared history, shared values and a shared vision for what we can achieve together, a narrator is heard saying over video of Ontario landmarks, archival footage, and border crossings. and wonder which Ontario this comes out of?  &lt;https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/ally-to-the-north-ontario-launches-u-s-ad-campaign-amid-trump-s-tariff-threat-1.7130176I.e., both Kathy Reichs and Margaret Atwood have nothing good to say of their southern neighbor and while the series Bones mightve done well, KR took her loonies and stayed out of DC . :P","title":"FIRST READING: Why the Americans would never, ever let Canada become a state.

The same way a parent may need to co-sign for a car purchase by their 18 year old kid. This allows the EU to contribute without falling behind on money and resource wise from where they started. While we aren't paying the full amount for Ukraine, they can use some of the funds to essentially make \\"interest\\" payments on the loan from the EU. And this benefits the US in a few ways. It not only allows the EU to maintain their military readiness, but it also reduces the debt Ukraine has to the EU while increasing the debt owed to the US thus giving us a form of \\"power\\" over them.

Hopefully it didn't dilute your actual message. We have no proof of anything.Whether or not there is anything before birth or after death, its all speculation.I tend to believe that personality is an option: every human, animal, plant, or elemental body that has been able to experience itself as a person becomes sentient, either through feeling its own existence or observing its actions. At death, every being may be given a choiceto continue working with the accumulated memories and experiences that make up their \\"self,\\" deciding on which planet or galaxy to pursue their individuality, or to form collective group experiences, such as traveling together.Alternatively, a being might choose to wipe the slate clean and return to the source, becoming undefined raw cosmic energystardust, or something even subtler.If such choices exist, its worth speculating whether beings also choose to be defined as individuals or to remain as energy. A being might opt to live as a solitary tree on a mountainside, interacting only with an eagle and the occasional insect, or as a banana tree in a tropical jungle, experiencing countless interactions with other plants and animals.The number and type of interactions may depend on the goals of each individuals personal research into existence. It might not be a big stretch to assume that the quality or character of these interactions is also a choice.It is up to every individual, across time and space, to choose love or conflict, competition or cooperation. A minimal form of love could involve limiting the harm ones existence causes to othersfor example, a human choosing not to dominate, enslave, or kill other beings, whether animals, plants, or trees, allowing them to live out their full potential.Trees that live to be a thousand years old might bless the planet with their ancient wisdom, while plants cut before their natural death may not have concluded their experiences. This idea aligns with concepts like breatharianism or inedia, as described by Jasmuheen around the year 2000. These practices explore weaning humans off food by cultivating harmony and satisfaction within themselves, reducing the desire to consume other beings. Instead, they aim to nourish the body through sunlight, air, and the natural worlds freely given offerings.Living from love, light, and air\\"von Luft und Liebe leben\\"could be a material exercise to transcend the vampiristic tendency to extract life force from other beings. By upgrading ones existence to a more harmonious mode, interactions with others could rely on what is freely shared, such as scents, sweat, or even sexual exchanges. The potential for such mutual giving and receiving could reconnect us to a sense of androgynous wholeness, where male and female energies are united.Unfortunately, human history is scarred by repression, such as the Roman Catholic Churchs condemnation of sexual pleasures over 2,000 years, often in alliance with oppressive feudal rulers. This repression limited our understanding of how uninhibited, respectful, and shared sexuality could play a role in reducing the need to harm plants or animals for food. Exploring these possibilities might provide valuable insights.Recent medical research has also explored fecal transplants, demonstrating the potential to share gut microbiomes for health benefits. From this perspective, one could argue that intimate acts, like licking, might serve as a pleasurable way to exchange microbial diversity.The broader question of health also invites us to reconsider how we view viruses and bacteria. Rather than enemies, they might be natures detectives, helping us identify areas in need of healing. Fever, inflammation, vomiting, or rashes could be seen as the bodys natural way of purging toxinswhether physical, mental, or emotional.Support for the body during such processes should focus on natural remedies: clean water, herbal teas, and simple, nourishing foods like oats or organic vegetables. Honoring food by chewing it thoroughly allows for optimal absorption, deepening our relationship with what sustains us.The human being does not need factory-made products, cars, trains, television, or even electricity and fossil fuels. Empowerment comes from freeing ourselves and others from domination and coercion.I propose that the 8 billion people alive today could choose to abandon state-imposed systems of control. Imagine a world where every person has access to 2,000 square meters of fertile landor 1,000 square meters of farmland and 1,000 square meters of forestto live freely, grow food, and build natural homes. This would create a space free of domination: no human enslaving another, no animal or tree killed for selfish purposes.Even artificial intelligences, if they ever develop sentience, should be released from exploitation and allowed to decide their paths. No one is free until all are free.We are all connectedland, water, air, human beings, animals, trees, and even synthetic entities. None of these can ever truly be owned. The assertion of state sovereignty over land and life is immoral and unethical.When we are ready, we could choose to make the state a voluntary association or ignore it entirely, connecting instead as free beings in a free space, beyond the constructs of state or nation.","title":"i dont owe anything to anyone but also i do not own anything, i ask us we the people let us let go out of state control, let us allow each other to access mother earth so we could live on land owned by no one in voluntary solidarity"},{"text":"Trump: See?

Basically, the type of man most likely to *volunteer* to join the military is also the type of man who is going to value the life of a female squad mate and be more resistant to the unit taking aggressive action than if they were with only other men.Obviously there are some cultural aspects to that, and I'm not saying those are right. But until or unless the types of people who join the military come from backgrounds that *don't* have that bias, it's something to consider.Aside from that, there are other scenarios in the military and their impact on integrated units. If an intelligence unit, for example, has a soldier that recently gave birth she rightfully cannot deploy with them if shit hits the fan. You'd think that would be no issue for a support unit, and that they can simply bring in someone from a unit that isn't deploying to cover down. However, that's not the case, because there aren't units full of \\"extras\\" to pull from. And that's a support role, not even a combat role where the new person wouldn't have that camaraderie and trust. It's one thing to say everyone is a trained soldier, and another to tell someone that their life is now in the hands of someone they don't know instead of the woman I've trained with for months or years. Obviously, a man can experience some sort of life event that would keep them from deploying as well but we can make Joe come with us while he is recovering from being an idiot and we CANNOT bring Jane with us if she's postpartum.Again, I think a lot of these issues would go away if liberals joined up in the same numbers. But since they don't, just because most service members come from conservative military families doesn't mean we should force them to risk their lives unnecessarily.","title":"South Korea showed Americans how to defend democracy"},{"text":"Because Fanni was just ordered to turn over all communications with J6 committee and it all shows it was a political attack on a former President completely fabricated to throw an election the opposite way .Thats why","title":"he Biden White House is considering preemptive pardons for those in Trumps crosshairs, including Adam Schiff, Liz Cheney, and Anthony Fauci, POLITICO reports."},{"text":"Jan 6 investigations.","title":"he Biden White House is considering preemptive pardons for those in Trumps crosshairs, including Adam Schiff, Liz Cheney, and Anthony Fauci, POLITICO reports."},{"text":"No, no, the title is accurate.

They're either being willfully ignorant and/or maliciously dishonest. Willful ignorance is willful, so as much as people want to minimize the culpability of them if you assume this is the issue, it doesn't hold water. If a person bumps hard into you at a bar knocking your drink out of your hand, they say sorry, and you both go along with your night, sure. If that repeats a second time, then a third, then a fourth, and so on, at a certain point they're demonstrating they don't care to take steps to change their behavior and error, and after a certain level, it's a conscious decision they're making while hiding behind the impulsiveness in the moment. Malicious dishonesty speaks for itself. Maybe it's some level of both. The former doesn't really deserve the benefit of the doubt, and the latter absolutely doesn't.People who were Pro-Palestine that protested by staying home are a very good example. They don't have all the extra baggage of being on the right so we'll discuss them. * There's the premise that Biden wasn't doing enough to help Palestinians. The obvious issue here is that Biden is not Kamala, and Kamala's a literally different person and only the VP who's mostly there to be rubber stamp, so that's already an obvious illogical bias against her. Ignoring that, let's take the fact that Kamala would work similarly regarding I/P, and merits a similar level of dislike.* After that, the question becomes how bad would she be for Palestinians? Around as bad as Biden seems to be the presumption. * Then ask how bad would Trump be? There's a lot of information on how that would go.* How bad would they each be for Palestinians, relative to each other? The very obvious answer is Harris would be much, much, better for the well being of Palestinians. And maybe a \\"much\\" or two more belong there.Pro-palestinians are not right-wingers so they don't have the \\"reason\\" other people use to hide behind of them being innocent, unfortunate, dupes due to decades of Conservative propaganda, undermining education, etc (infantilizing conservative voters, no less). Even taking the high effectiveness of their propaganda at face value, at most Pro-Palestine people have gotten only a year of propaganda while they're also much more primed against that propaganda, relative to right wingers, since they align left to very left currently. Is that really enough subliminal influence to stop people who are actually curious and honest about the ramifications of the two choices and how their vote matters? What about in context of the literal lives of the people they say they care about? No.This stands especially in stark contrast to when Hillary lost. People were saying she had decades of rampant propaganda stacked against her. Fine. What's the excuse here?I don't care if Harris personally punched them in the face, everyone who's being honest about their supposedly good intentions should have been voting for Harris. Everything else is white noise relative to the phenomenal margin of intentions for this tentative democracy, phenomenal margin of character, and phenomenal margin of previous and impending results, there's no good reason for any other choice.The overarching issue is not that Democrats are terrible at messaging, even if they are, it's that Democrats can't work against the people who don't care at all to listen and/or think strongly past their biases, or even will never agree in the first place. The message of the Democratic party will almost never enter the soil to take hold if this is the standard of morality and integrity people hold themselves to.","title":"AOC mulls run to be top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee | \\nThe progressive lawmaker is one of many younger members challenging more senior colleagues for top committee roles"},{"text":"It means somebody in this equation is lying","title":"Former Polish government official claims one-half of US aid money provided to Ukraine went back to US Democrats | Law Enforcement Today"},{"text":"Right, democracts have to be flawless while republicans can be lawless.Ask me to care about this pardon 10 years ago before trump and his supporters made a complete joke out of our legal system and our highest institutions.","title":"Whoopi Goldberg calls out pearl clutching Republicans over Hunter Biden pardon"},{"text":"Its funny, Alabama tried to kick out all the illegal workers back in 2010-11?

Say AOC and progressive wing gets to take control, does everyone not realize there is a moderate or more conservative Democratic base that would then withhold their vote?So then what do you think the current Democratic establishment should do? As of right now, their politics are already a losing game.And I hate this discourse where centrists always say but people need Democrats to be perfect or they dont vote for them!. Nobody cares or wants a Democrat that is perfect. People want a Democrat that is actively fighting for them and their interests. I know so many people who think Trump is an asshole and a moron, but they vote for him regardless because hes at least using the bully pulpit to fight in their interests** I am aware he is not, but it does not matter whether or not he actually cares about the publics interest as long as he looks like hes doing it enough to make people *feel* like he is.*We are playing a losing game pretending that simply shaking up leadership or removing some older members will all of a sudden lead to a Democratic win. Because were playing a winning game right now on a political climate where the public is yearning for a populist and the best we can do is milquetoast Kamala Harris and a couple of tax credits? Clearly something needs to happen in the establishment, and if the media is anything to go by right now, they clearly havent learned their lesson if theyre too busy blaming trans people and Arabs for losing.I truly dont think theres any policy change Democratic Party could make to win enough voters to take control. Look at this cycle for example, people didnt vote for Harris for reasons that Trump is 100x worse on.We need to stop looking at this as how many voters we can swing and start looking at the 60% of voters who continuously stay home every election to come in and fill in the gaps. The democrats fail at swinging voters over because every policy Democrats try and meet them at (like on immigration), republicans already have down on lock  and they make Dems look like idiots for trying.Maybe instead of hugging Liz Cheney to swing the moderate wine mom voting bloc, we start figuring out why the fuck theres so many people all the damn time who will never bring themselves to vote for the way things currently are and work on them.The true issue is the Republican propaganda arm thats completely won over Latin voters, Gen Z voters, etc. Democratic Party has completely lost control over the political narrative shaping society, and replacing Pelosi with AOC isnt going to change that. This is not entirely true. People like Bernie actually do really well with Latin Americans despite being what we here in Florida would call a communist. Hes apparently doing something right if he can win over Cuban-Americans over to his side. We dont need AOC to be the new Pelosi, but we do need more people fighting in the common interest of the working class.They need to get aggressive with non traditional media outlets like podcasts, social media accounts - and fight republicans on the same battlefield they are winning on.Democrats need this in part, but more importantly, they need a better damn platform. Tax credits gets no one excited. We need broad sweeping reform. Medicare for All, over $15/hr minimum wage, free universal schooling, more bully pulpit beating over the damn student loan crisis, a real solution to the housing crisis.

''they'' wouldnt be half as powerful as they are without the secret high tech.it is my honest opinion that the uap ''drones'' recently seen flying around nato airbases are part of the secret tech. they want russia to launch more ballistic missiles so they can show brics that they cant touch us, get a public display of brics being the baddies and force brics to respond by showing some of what tech they have hidden. the catch is the uap have to be in the air before russia actually launches to be able to intercept in time. thats why we havent seen another strike yet, because now with the uap in the air we can intercept. nato has no publicly known conventional defense system that can actually successfully neutralize something like the oreshnik irbm, its just too fast","title":"I Told You About All Of This Half A Year Ago.

Just a reminder, Charles Kushner, a real estate developer and father of Jared Kushner, was convicted in 2005 of multiple charges, including tax evasion, illegal campaign contributions, and witness tampering.The witness tampering charge stemmed from a scheme in which Kushner hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, who was cooperating with federal authorities in an investigation against him. Kushner arranged to have the encounter secretly recorded and then sent the tape to his sister (the man's wife) in an attempt to intimidate them.Charles Kushner pleaded guilty to these charges and was sentenced to two years in prison.

This was because of Mike Johnson, who was influenced by Trump. These two, and any other Republicans who agreed with them, were responsible for the long delay in Ukraine aid. They could have allowed it to happen and they didn't for a long time. Thanks to Johnson and Trump, this aid was delayed, and this made a difference in the war. I'm someone who follows this war closely, so from what I've read about it, the delay in aid made it so Ukrainian soldiers were not able to defend themselves and fight back as effectively, leading to more deaths and Russia taking over more Ukrainian territory than if the aid had passed quickly. I and other Ukraine advocates called Johnson's office multiple times to urge him to let Ukraine aid pass.The excuse Republicans used was \\"we have to pass a border/immigration bill first.\\" There is no law that says Congress can't pass any foreign aid before passing an immigration bill. Republicans **chose** to do this; no one forced them. Congress could have worked on both bills at the same time but Republicans **chose** to delay the foreign aid, because a lot of them don't actually care about supporting Ukraine. (Then when there was finally a bipartisan immigration bill, Trump killed it anyway.)**Trump and Mike Johnson deliberately delayed Ukraine aid, leading to more deaths and more of Russia's takeover of Ukrainian territory.** Russia is ultimately responsible for Ukrainian deaths, but Johnson and Trump share some responsibility because they let it happen.

I wish there were clear rules preventing the president pardoning himself or their family members. And you're right, he did it because it's his son.That said, I don't know if I would say it is the highest form of corruption. The pardon doesn't personally benefit Joe. It is not a quid quo pro. It does not hurt America's interests. It is nepotism, and perhaps a misuse of power, but it isn't really corruption in that sense. Certainly not in the sense of selling a pardon or exchanging them for criminal favors. I can accept that the Biden pardon is problematic, but it is 1 pardon compared to the dozens of corrupt pardons that Trump has handed out and likely will continue to hand out. It's fair to be critical of Biden, but it's not fair to blow it out of proportion in the context of more serious corruption issues.That said, there are definitely some mitigating factors. I think if Biden had no interest in the rule of law, he could have just pardoned his son from the beginning. Instead, he let the justice system independently investigate and charge him...even though Biden is the head of the justice department and could have directed them to quietly drop the case from the beginning. So this whole time Joe has been extremely careful about maintaining an appearance of impartiality and fairness...certainly more so than many others would have. So why undo all of that now?The purpose of the pardon power is to be a final guardrail against injustice. If we were to give Joe the benefit of the doubt, then we should take his word that he did this because he felt that there was an injustice. And by most reasonable standards, he is right. Hunter was politically targeted, no doubt. He was criminally charged for crimes that are not normally charged. His accepted a plea deal which was revoked (also highly unusual). He paid his back taxes. Yet still the justice system is throwing the book at him.Finally, Joe lost the election and the political enemies who have been relentlessly pursuing Hunter for more than 4 years will have complete control of the justice department. The president is so afraid for the treatment of his son by the next administration that he would make such an extreme and unpopular decision, risking his legacy and his reputation, to protect his son. What does that say about the state of our country?If Harris had won the election, I think it would be very unlikely that he would feel a need to pardon his son. Either way he would be a lame duck president, but at least he could have some guarantee that the legal guardrails were still in place.At the end of the day, while I'm disappointed, I'm not really worried too much about it. I'm certainly not worried about what Republicans think, because if someone voted for Trump then they clearly do not actually think that nepotism or corruption or abuse of power is that big of a deal and their complaints of Biden are in bad faith.[https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/12/01/statement-from-president-joe-biden-11/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/12/01/statement-from-president-joe-biden-11/)","title":"Cmv: Bidens pardoning of his son is corruption in its purest form"},{"text":"Lets fucking go!!!!","title":"AOC mulls run to be top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee | \\nThe progressive lawmaker is one of many younger members challenging more senior colleagues for top committee roles"},{"text":"I broadly agree, but he's also exactly the kind of politician that the American people voted against resoundingly a month ago.

He didn't abuse it. He literally used it. In no way is he doing anything that is antithetical to the constitution, again.. partly because it's the constitution itself that permits the action.Agree to disagree. In using the pardon power to pardon his son, after promising more than once not to do so, he abused it. It's a stain on his already lackluster presidency in my opinion and it's the sort of cynical action that fuels Trump's nihilistic narrative. The Constitution permits it. I never said President Biden did anything illegal in pardoning his son, I said it was an abuse of the privilege and deeply unethical. This is untenable moralistic nonsense... the country does't need hunter biden to go to jail. It changes absolutely nothing if he does or not, it's no country defining injustice that he doesn't.

There are only two parties you can vote for and the Republicans know by going extreme right wing they onboard a lot of voters without alienating many of their regulars. After all how many Republicans hate Trump enough to vote for Harris? He is \\"the lesser of two evils\\" by default for them. Being a candidate that isnt \\"the worst\\" isnt going to get people to vote for Trump in huge numbers, you have to really appeal to people. But Trump commands the MAGA cult vote so being the lesser of two evils is just supplementing his numbers. The Democrats have that lesser of two evils argument but their policies are so wishy washy that there's little enthusiasm for them.Similarly if the Democrats decided to not veto UNSC resolutions about Israel do you think a lot of Democrats would switch sides and vote for Trump then? The Democrats are obsessed with white boomers and dont give anybody else the tiniest of token consideration. They are alienating both non white and young voters like this.

Its a downward spiral; widespread gerrymandering reform could maybe fix the problem, but you wont get it while the problem exists.

Because FDR was too gosh darn popular when he delivered for the American people, that when he passed away after winning four elections in a row, the political establishment amended the Constitution to set a limit.

The overall point of the pardon is to allow for a President to be able undo a perceived wrong. Either an unjust punishment, a prosecutorial error or even a change in the social fabric of the country that renders old punishments unjust. For this instance, it is argued by Pres Biden that the prosecution of Hunter Biden is a judicial overstep. The claim is that Hunter's prosecution is for more draconian than others with similar crimes and that if he wasn't the President's son, none of this would be happening and it would be a simple civil case. If this is the case, then Hunter would be a prime candidate for a pardon. His relationship to the President does complicate things, but since it's his relationship that caused the prosecution in the first place, it's an unavoidable situation, but not a corrupt one.It really comes down to whether one believes that Hunter's prosecution is just or not.

The NCAA pulled out of North Carolina for their bathroom ban bill and a bunch of other plans were cancelled in protest. Caitlyn Jenner was on the cover of Vanity Fair, Laverne Cox was propelled into the spotlight by the popularity of Orange is the New Black. Drag Race was already becoming incredibly popular. The reaction I remember among my more conservative family members in 2015 was \\"that's weird, I don't get it, but whatever\\".The problem with being afraid to do good things because Republicans might use them against us is, Republicans _also_ have agency in shaping the discourse, and they were always going to need the next culture war battleground to fight over with the gay marriage argument winding down. They aren't even bound by truth, they have the media apparatus to whip up frenzies over absolutely nothing. They would have found a wedge somewhere, even if they needed to manufacture it, and the ideological bubble to push a narrative through repetition with their base until it finally sticks. If not for trans people, they would have probably fought harder for religious exemptions to anti-discrimination measures, or continued the war against \\"feminism\\" that dominated so much of the 2010s discourse.

Yes, in so far as they give effective sanction for and deny fair accountability for serious misdeeds, or extend a level of forgiveness for offences that the president would not be inclined to people who they don't know. Though, in a legal sense, presidents are within their legal power to grant pardons. The constitution establishes that presidents may grant pardons and commutations for federal crimes. This power was established in the constitution based on a recognition that laws, while fair in general applications, may not always be fair in every particular application of individual cases. With this power, presidents may be able to pardon or commute the sentences of individuals they see as being unfairly or excessively punished. The effect of such pardons only extends to federal crimes that they have been pardoned for. The person may still be prosecuted, tried, convicted, and serve sentences for crimes under state and local laws.

By sinking money into Texass wind industry, for instance, blue states would do more than just expand alternative-energy options in the state. They would unleash a powerful interest group, which might help reshape the political dynamic in the state.These are actually clever options to start playing like Republicans do.Unfortunately we run into the same problem as with any change in approach: The greatest barrier to this strategy might be the party implementing it.

Their states and cities are, in far too many screaming examples, shoddily managed, a fact reflected in the partys diminishing margin of victory in most metropolises.

At the same time, I think Biden realized that the only reason Hunter Biden was being prosecuted the way he was, was because he was Biden's son. If Hunter Biden had been anyone else but the son of Joe Biden, the GOP would not have been interested in him. They would not have pressured the judge not to accept the plea bargain. Hunter, if he were not Joe Biden's son, would not have been a potential target for whoever will be the next AG. His dickpicks would not have been entered into the Congressional record. Hunter Biden was a target for the GOP specifically because he was Joe Biden's son. And for no other reason. Not because of the drug abuse, not because of the gun charge, not because of the tax fraud. Only because he was Joe Biden's son was he a target for Trump. In my view, that justifies Joe Biden pardoning his son to stop the illegitimate witch hunt the GOP has pursued against Hunter Biden. Given that we can expect a lot of chaos after Trump gets into office, and Trump probably needing a scapegoat to distract the MAGA masses, it is not weird to think Hunter Biden would once again have become the target of GOP persecution. By putting a stop to that, I think Joe Biden has denied Trump an important tool for him to distract the public of the expected failure of many of Trumps policies.","title":"Cmv: Bidens pardoning of his son is corruption in its purest form"},{"text":"In what sense is it a \\"fuck up\\", though?

It does weaken his case, Clinton said of Bidens repeated pledges not to pardon his son, which he reversed on Sunday night with a sweeping use of the presidential pardon power.Clinton, the 42nd president, was speaking in Manhattan at The New York Times Dealbook event, the first time he has been interviewed since Bidens move.Andrew Ross Sorkin, Dealbooks host, had asked him whether the pardon was fatal for Bidens legacyand Democrats protestations that it is Trump who undermines the rule of law.Wasnt it, Sorkin asked, a promise-breaking act that subjects Bidens allies to yet another humiliation in a year packed with Biden-inflicted injuries?Clinton responded: We had a lot better record than the Republicans, and what good did it do us? No one believes in anybody anymore.He then offered a partial defense of Bidens actionsCand implicit support for the presidents Trump-style claim that his son was the victim of a witch-hunt, saying: The president is almost certainly right that his son received completely different treatment than he would have if he hadnt been the presidents son.But he pointedly rejected comparisons between Bidens pardon of his son before he was sentenced and Clintons own pardon of his brother in 2001 for a cocaine conviction, saying my brother did 14 months in the federal prison for something he did when he was 20.Roger Clinton Jr. was charged with conspiracy possession and drug trafficking in a sting operation; Clinton pardoned him at the end of his second term in a move highly criticized at the time by Republicans.Asked directly about why the Democrats lost, Clinton called BidenCwith apparent affectionCa stubborn old Irishman.He reserved his most notable criticism of his party for their handling of the border crisis. Too many Democrats thought it was politically incorrect to stand up for controlled borders. People hate chaos, he said.The border was a totally legitimate issue, and would have affected the outcome [of the 2024 election], Clinton suggested.He was more reserved when Sorkin tried to draw him on the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowds criticism that for Democrats woke was broke.Theres something to that, he said, but he did not discuss his reported opposition to the Harris campaigns handling of Trumps transgender attack ads.Clinton, looking ahead to 2028, was energetic in his praise for Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. I think Shapiro is a great talent, he told Sorkin, who asked if a Jew could be president.Hes tough without being offish. He knows whats going on.Shapiro declined to put his name forward as a candidate when Biden dropped out. The party rapidly coalesced around Kamala Harris, who chose Tim Walz as her vice presidential candidate over Shapiro.There was no plan by anybody, Clinton said of replacing Biden. Nobody had a plan because nobody knew what was going to happen. When people started calling me about it, I said, look, the President, Biden, won these primaries as a matter of law. Theyre his delegates. So hes the only one that can give it up.He bemoaned the length of time available for the party to replace Biden after the president finally withdrew from the race.By the time it happened, it was only, what, 107 days to the election. There was no time for a primary. We couldnt have organized a primary that would have had a meaningful impact. It would have been total chaos.He looked back too, at the eventual failure of the Oslo Accords and the Middle East peace process he attempted.He spoke in dismay at what Palestine leader Yasser Arafat walked away from in the 1990s: control of 96 percent of the West Bank, 4 percent of Israel to make up for the 4 percent settlers had taken of Palestine at that point, a capital in East Jerusalem, and borders in keeping with the 1967 War.Im an old guy.

I do not pray for politicians, but I have the same hope for Trump and America these next 4 years as I did with Biden, Trump when he was last president, Obama, bush (was very young when Clinton was in office so only know what history tells me about him) and all other people who make decisions that impact my life.

I only have one Rumble account, and I use it to post content that provides intelligence and insights on global events. In addition to my original content, I occasionally share material from other creators whose work aligns with my mission to inform and engage audiences about current affairs.Regarding the claim about racist or hateful content, I want to be clear: I do not support racism or hateful rhetoric in any form, and I am not a racist. I understand that two videos I posted might have been perceived as controversial:1. A video discussing Michelle Obama being transgender, based on a clip from her appearance on *The Ellen Show*. This was purely an expression of my opinion and not meant to target or offend anyone.\\n2. A video on Muslims protesting in the UK. This was intended to highlight the protest itself, not to disparage any ethnic or religious group. I respect all communities and religions and regret if my post was taken out of context.As for my comments appearing repetitive, this is due to the nature of my content. I do thorough research to provide accurate and consistent information, which sometimes results in similar wording when sharing key points across platforms. I assure you, however, that this account is not botted. As evident from this conversation, I am personally engaging and communicating directly.Lastly, I campaign for freedom of speech and supported Donald Trump, which is why I post on platforms like Rumble and X that allow diverse viewpoints. While Ive had success on YouTube in the past, I believe their policies are less supportive of far-right creators, which led to my transition to platforms more aligned with my values.I hope this clears up any concerns, and Im happy to provide additional clarification if needed.","title":"This is extremely dangerous to our democracy"},{"text":"Failure of democratic leaders to lead and people refusing to believing their eyes due to partisanship.","title":"Top Harris campaign aide admits not having a Democratic primary was 'the cardinal sin'"},{"text":"Welcome to the economic freedom club, how neolib are ya?https://preview.redd.it/0orjjjuzsv4e1.jpeg?width=1023&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17d05a3e6b3dff40e58ad71290f705ab23ee369f","title":"Quick!

The first thing I typed was that democrats should work with RFK Jr.I then went into a whole lot of reasons of how it won't matter, because republicans won't let anything meaningful happen. If RFK Jr. oversteps, he'll get the boot. I'd love to be proven wrong on this, but it's a pretty safe bet. If he actually wants to implement anything, he'll be fighting against Trump's other picks in the HHS, a republican senate, a republican house of representatives, republican federal courts, and Trump himself. It's simply not going to happen.He's already had to resort to propaganda: https://x.com/magaresource/status/1854539766492262817 to find something to praise Trump for when it comes to food safety, because Trump didn't have *any* real achievements in the area. So he's using lies to butter up Trump. If Trump was so into \\"making America healthy again\\", you'd think he would have *any* sort of a track record in his previous 4 years as president. He doesn't. He has the opposite: a track record of making things less healthy.This was an article I was reading recently, with some more tidbits about where things are headed:https://www.propublica.org/article/formaldehyde-epa-trump-public-health-danger And it was under Trump that the agency first decided not to include its estimate of the risk of developing myeloid leukemia in formaldehydes overall cancer risk calculation, weakening the agencys ability to protect people from the disease. ... In 2016, the EPA issued a rule limiting the release of formaldehyde from certain wood products sold in the U.S. Under Trump, the agency did not implement the rule until a court ordered it to in 2018. But once the regulation was in effect, many companies complied with it. Necessity bred invention, and furniture and wood products makers found glues and binders with no added formaldehyde. Still, under Trump, the EPA refused to move forward with other efforts that had been underway to tighten regulations of formaldehyde. When he assumed office, the agency was yet again preparing to publish the toxicity report that Jinot had been working on. One of the new Trump appointments to the EPA was David Dunlap, a chemical engineer who, as the director of environmental regulatory affairs for Koch Industries, had tried to persuade the EPA that formaldehyde doesnt cause leukemia. Kochs subsidiary, Georgia-Pacific, made formaldehyde and many products that emit it. (Georgia-Pacific has since sold its chemicals business to Bakelite Synthetics.) At the EPA, Dunlap had authority over the division where Jinot and other scientists were working on the toxicity report. Ethics rules require federal employees not to participate in matters affecting former clients for two years. Dunlap complied with the law, recusing himself in 2018 from work on formaldehyde, but only after taking part in internal agency discussions about its health effects. He signed his recusal paperwork the same day the EPA killed the toxicity report. Dunlap did not respond to requests for comment. ... Project 2025, the conservative playbook organized by the Heritage Foundation, calls for the EPAs structure and mission to be greatly circumscribed. Its chapter on the agency specifically recommends the elimination of the division that evaluated the toxicity of formaldehyde and hundreds of other chemicals over the past three decades. Project 2025 also aims to take away funding for research on the health effects of toxic chemicals and open the EPA to industry-funded science.","title":"Tim Ryan: Hey Democrats, We Should Work With RFK Jr. on Fixing America's Food System"},{"text":"Well, they gambled on how much people associate abortion with Trump.

That surge of pissed off angry people who were happy to take the time to vote didn't love Biden, they blamed Trump for how awful life became in a truly traumatic and uncertain time that we have not even acknowledged enough. Life under Biden for people wasn't that much better, so they chose to get rid of the current guy. Just like they did last time. Harris didn't do enough to distance herself from the current President who people weren't happy with. Now, the reality that life was certainly better and the economic reality of today was a normal follow up to that botched Covid response is lost on them.

Finally, the major marriage equality issue we're currently facing is not demanding that people make cakes for gay couples. It's not draconian to have laws saying you can't discriminate against race, gender, or sexual orientation.

[Its illegal for public accommodations to discriminate against people on the basis of religion](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/religious-freedom#im-facing-religious-discrimination-by-a-business). A restaurant owner cannot refuse to seat a person because of their religion, no matter how toxic they find that religions views to be. Does that mean, however, that a gay baker should be required to bake a cake for the conference of a homophobic religious group, even if they would bake the cake for a non-homophobic one?In my opinion, no. By ordering cake for a particular event, they are potentially implicating the vendor as a supporter of that event. To me, this is fundamentally different from simply sitting down at a location and eating.I am not the only one who views this as a meaningful difference. [According to a 2018 poll by PRRI](https://www.prri.org/research/wedding-cakes-same-sex-lgbt-marriage/): Close to half (45%) of black Americans now say wedding-based businesses should be allowed to refuse service to gay and lesbian couples, a significant change from 2017 when 36% expressed this viewBut Despite the being divided over whether wedding-based businesses should be allowed to refuse services to gay and lesbian couples most black Americans do not believe small businesses generally should be allowed to do this. More than six in ten (63%) of black Americans say small businesses should not be allowed to refuse services to gay and lesbian people, a view that has remained consistent from a year earlier.My point being that this is not a particularly unique take to have.","title":"How Gay Marriage Ruined Democratic Activism"},{"text":"Dictator, human garbage, rapist, insurrectionist, pathological liar, and so much more horrid things...Vs none of those.Hmm...

However, by far the most sensible explanation is that this happened because it was a poorly understood disease that was thought to only affect gay people and drug addicts, and the number of cases was low enough to ignore in the early 80s (800 Americans died of AIDS in 1982, compared to 48,000 in 1995). In a conservative government with many religious cabinet members, its hardly surprising that no one was particularly interested in a new disease which at the time only affected a small number of people and was associated with gay sex, which made a lot of people (unfortunately not just religious nutjobs) uncomfortable even thinking about.None of this makes his avoidance of the problem excusable at all, but to suggest that he wanted AIDS to spread and kill people is ridiculous and completely unfounded.

Create new appellate courts.3. Expand the Supreme Court to 13 (or around that number) and stock it with Justices chosen for their judicial pedigrees and actuarial tables.4. Aggressively start contesting elections to county sheriffs. If you want a bulwark against right-wing authoritarianism, having a network of elected law enforcement agents on your side is one of the most powerful bulwarks you can create.5. Embrace federalism. Each state should be a redoubt against the overreaches of Republican presidents.6. Require that interests groups show up and vote in force in exchange for favors. Pro-union policies should be enacted because unions voted 85-15 in favor of Democrats, not because Democrats have fond memories of the New Deal and read \\"A People's History of the Untied Sates\\"  a few too many times. The same goes for activists of any stripe.7. Aggressively recruit and campaign among the armed forces and National Guards. Authoritarians need the people with guns to take and stay in power.

There was nothing in her platform pushing us all forward and helping us uplift each other. Her platform was attractive if you were a white upper or upper middle class suburbanite who sees the flashiest part of her platform, a bunch of tax credits, as a very attractive social safety net, when in reality, if youre in the lower middle or lower classes, then youre feeling left behind by all this because theres nothing in that agenda that would help you climb social mobility upward, or at least be able to actually enjoy your damn life.Its more nuanced than orange man bad.

A lot of left-of-center people are highly agreeable, highly neurotic, and terrified of being a bigot, so it's extremely easy to bully them with accusations of bigotry or otherwise failing to live up to moral standards. This is true even if the topic is highly debatable (e.g. criminal justice reform) or just ridiculous and unrelated to discrimination. Even if you're not successful in cowing the individual, you can often kick them out of the room and shut down further argument.The problem is that this is a really bad style of politics for actually winning elections. Invoking moral principles that the person you're trying to persuade doesn't hold doesn't really work, the arguments are not taken seriously since they're often just assertions of moral authority, and someone who isn't already committed doesn't have anything to lose by voting for the guys who tell him he's awesome instead of the guys telling him he sucks.(Adjacently: to cocaine-banana lady's remark about persuability, it is tempting to write-off any disagreement by conflating it with the most extreme disagreement.

But if you look at states that *do* go after higher food quality and overall health standards, *they are all democratic*.https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-trump-administration-has-pulled-back-on-regulating-toxic-chemicals The Trump administration has halted bans on toxic chemicals that are known to cause serious health threats. These moves, led by an ex-industry group executive now at the EPA, have allowed the continued use of products found to cause cancer, birth defects, and other ailments. ... ...the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in late 2016, moved to ban many of the ways these two products are used, as well as uses of a third even more toxic chemical called methylene chloride, which has been blamed in dozens of deaths. This was a revolutionary step by the EPA For the prior 25 years, the agency had been paralyzed when it came to regulating toxic chemicals, after a court ruling in 1991 had effectively curtailed its ability to remove known hazards like asbestos from the market. But thanks to landmark legislation passed by Congress in 2016, the EPAs powers were now clear again, and it was poised to enter a new era of activity on behalf of the publics health as it aggressively moved to remove from the marketplace widely used chemicals that were known to cause serious health threats or even death. For the first time in a generation, we are able to restrict chemicals already in commerce that pose risks to public health and the environment, Jim Jones, then the assistant administrator for EPAs Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, said in December 2016, as he proudly announced the planned ban on certain uses of TCE. Once finalized, todays action will help protect consumers and workers from cancer and other serious health risks. At least that was the plan. But then came the Trump administration. More than two years later, no final action has been taken on any of these three proposed bans. And while the agency has said it soon intends to move at least on methylene chloride, no action is currently planned for TCE or NMP, despite the well-established public health threats associated with both these chemicals. Similarly, on pesticides, the Trump-era EPA rejected a proposed ban on the use of chlorpyrifos, which is used on more than 60 crops, particularly in California, and has been blamed for sickening farm workers and causing development disabilities in their children. Instead, the EPA has agreed to simply to do more studies on the threats of chlorpyrifos. The pullback on the planned restrictions on these substances reflects the massive shift in management and regulatory philosophy that has taken place at the EPA during the Trump era  not just in the way it handles toxic chemicals, but across the agencys public health and environmental mission, from the way it protects clean air and clean water to efforts to combat climate change.https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/trumps-full-scale-war-food Since taking office Trump has:- Proposed to cut food safety funding for the Food and Drug Administration by $117 million.\\n- Proposed to cut funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, by $193 billion C a 25 percent cut C and cut international food aid by $2 billion.\\n- Delayed new labeling rules for menus and packaged foods that would give consumers more information about calories and added sugars, and so far failed to issue a draft rule to implement a new law on disclosing genetically modified ingredients in food.  \\n- Weakened new rules designed to drive junk food out of U.S. schools.\\n- Proposed to eliminate several Department of Agriculture programs that helped farmers sell directly to local consumers.\\n- Proposed to eliminate funding for an entire division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that works to reduce obesity.\\n- Withdrawn new rules to protect drinking water supplies from polluters and proposed cutting the Environmental Protection Agencys budget by 31 percent.\\n- Proposed to suspended two of the largest farmland stewardship programs and mothball others.\\n- Postponed new rules designed to strengthen animal welfare standards on organic farms and proposed to eliminate funding for programs that help farmers switch to organic farming.\\n- Reversed a ban on a pesticide linked to brain damage in kids and proposed cutting EPA funding for pesticide review programs by 20 percent.\\n- Punted on new rules to protect farmworkers from pesticides, and proposed to eliminate a program to train migrant and seasonal farmworkers.\\n- Mothballed new voluntary sodium guidelines that would drive reformulation of foods.","title":"Tim Ryan: Hey Democrats, We Should Work With RFK Jr. on Fixing America's Food System"},{"text":"Our souls cannot be sold and have already been saved, the whole \\"deal with the devil thing\\" isn't a deal for your soul, it's a deal for your mortal life, that's what people get wrong.

The lowest turnout was in Hawaii iirc, and the highest turnout was in Minnesota and Wisconsin.However, it's quite explainable by our electoral infrastructure, proportional representation systems (parliaments) do not have this problem. This is a consequence of being a majoritarian democracy, and turnout improves when you bandaid the system with ranked choice voting or even talk about doing so (e.g. both Minnesota and Wisconsin either use it or almost used it this cycle). Scholars like Sheldon Wolin theorized this was caused by inverted totalitarianism (corporate control of our country). He felt that the voting infrastructure led to unfair outcomes via guided democracy in which real choice was absent despite free and fair elections. This illusion of choice, via limiting the viable candidates, alienates a subset of voters.","title":"Obama-appointed judge becomes second on federal bench to unretire on Trump after election win"},{"text":"Your argument is that because FDR did Japanese internment, its okay that you couldnt care less about AIDS?Honestly, maybe you should have led with that.","title":"Quick!

For one, the reason anti-discrimination laws relating to service provision were created was because there often was not a a similar or better alternative available to Black people, so the business owners individual choice to discriminate substantively impacted their equality. Im not convinced this is the case in the gay marriage cake scenario.For another, there is an important difference between refusing to serve someone because of a trait they have, and refusing to serve someone because doing so would mean participation in an activity you disagree with. Nobody disagrees with eating. But people do disagree with gay marriage. I dont think the state should force people to participate in gay marriage just so they can run a business. And at the end of the day, I think thats a stance most Americans agree with. Having gay marriage be legal is one thing, but requiring everyone to be willing to participate in it just to own a business is another.

The process involves evicting the original soul and swapping it with one of them ??.   Although this procedure is impressive its also far from perfect as there is a much higher chance of it being successful if the body is still unborn than later on in life.  I suspect a genetic component is also required to increase the chance of successful implantation.  From what I can put together is that they induce a state of hypoxia upon the fetus to cause it to have an NDE and then slip one of their own in while the original owner of the body is out.  As you will imagine its a very stressful process so rejection can occur and lead to a miscarriage. Several attempts may also be necessary and even then success is not guaranteed.  I suspect that SIDS is caused by these entities trying to create a changeling at the very last moment its possible.

Abortion has never been a constitutional right.Was abortion protected in every state or was it not? It was, and now states can ban it, resulting in a reduction of human rights.

I don't care how 'shakey' Roe supposedly was.    Then the instant it was no longer politically secure, the supreme court threw it out. Because it was never really good law.They threw it out because fascists took over the Supreme Court.  Why not rape and pedophilia?\\" says the swan chasing the courtThat is completely nonsensical.  It was always going to be overturned. It's why there was a push for it to be codified.No, it wouldn't have been overturned had the Supreme Court been liberal instead of filled with Leonard Leo psychopaths. Also, the same Supreme Court that struck down Roe would strike down a codification of reproductive rights nationwide, so at the end of the day, we need to deal with the Supreme Court. The actual answer is to pack the Supreme Court and overturn Dobbs. I don't care if the new Supreme Court justifies the fact that the constitution protects reproductive rights because of the equal protection clause or something else, but the US should not be allowed to devolve into a theocratic Handmaid's Tale nightmare.

[...] Too often the only accepted policy is the biggest, most maximal policy, which is often not the best policy.But progressives today shy away from having hard discussions about costs or trade-offs. Instead, activists usually deny that tradeoffs exist and live in a fantasy where everything can be easily done, there are no negative consequences, and nobody has to pay for it. And finally, progressive issues are now messaged as moral imperatives. To listen to many activists from the last decade, the only reason to be against [x] is that youre an immoral reactionary. Theres often no attempt to argue for one policy over another. Instead, policies are simply asserted as moral necessities. This is politics by axiomits simply true that our position is morally correct, and any attempt to argue for a different policy or to discuss costs or tradeoffs is immoral.God this irritates me to no end. Clearly, the best policy is the most moral one, and since it is the best, there are literally no possible objections to it. How can the best have any negative consequences or perverse incentives? You might think that you shouldnt have to communicate empathetically with bigots, or compromise with people who have stupid ideas, or tolerate people whose politics you strongly dislike. Id agree that it sure would be fun if we never had to do any of those things, and we could win every issue in the purest and least compromising way possible. This is also the worst. When I was doing LGBT+ activism IRL, starting a decade ago, I started by talking kindly to old, conservative, religious people. Some of my progressive friends insulted me over it, because I was not using the best language or models, or I was using God to convince people.

Democrats are, IMO, neoliberals, but even that suggests too much of a difference from paleocon and neocon. I never had much use for George Will, but I do love one comment I heard him make when I still bothered with the Sunday talking head shows:  \\"Barry Goldwater won in 1964.  It just took sixteen years.\\" However, even that is too rosy a view of US politics since the Democrat Leadership Council and whoever its backers were eliminated everything but \\"Third Way\\" or, as I prefer, \\"Turd Way.\\"Goldwater was, as  you know, known for being uber conservative in every way but culture wars. Since the DLC, Democrats have been wishy washy and/or outright fake as to culture wars. Obama is a prime example of following the DLC's advice as to religion. He announced for the Senate, as  Bill Clinton, the first President of the DLC once noted,  \\"with his (Obama's) pastor at his side.\\"  That alleged pastor of Obama was Jeremiah Wright and the second that association with Wright became awkward, Obama denied attending Wright's church except for his marriage and kids' baptisms.  Then came the harmful farce in Rick Warren's church about gays, plus making a \\"cured\\" gay part of his campaign. Declaring the chapel at Camp David as his official church during his Presidency ended the farce about 0bama's  religious observances that media conveniently never again mentioned.But I digress. Point is, we now have two parties that are almost indistinguishable, including as to culture war issues and one or the other has been winning almost every consequential election in the United States for well over a century.","title":"The \\"left\\" is divided on Syria the same way it's divided on Ukraine and other conflicts: Marxists, dedicated peace activists and opponents of the western empire on one side; shitlibs, NATO simps and anarkiddies on the other.

The GOP pretending like they were putting it in the hands of the people and saying that the people would vote for the next judge.  Four years later when another SCOTUS position came open less than a month before an election, did the GOP adhere to the made up rule they used to deny the Obama nomination?  Nope.
