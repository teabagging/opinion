That's something that they might not believe is true, definitely isn't true, and helps reinforce actual anti-Semitism. Netanyahu, Ben-Gvir, and Smotrich do not represent Judaism or its teachings, just as Trump does not represent Christianity or its teachings. Just as Trump is corrosive to the Christian faith and it's perception, Israel's current government can be corrosive to Jewish faith and it's perception.Most non-extremists just see an unpopular, extreme far-right government that is acting contrary to Israel's interests, their allies' interests, and regional and global stability. They see Israel's allies making honest attempts at mediating peace and Israel's extreme government spitting in their eye.

Divisions between states are now far more arbitrary, with travel between states, even across the entire country, now being largely trivial.

There is no Texas passport to go abroad with USA on top; you dont get treated differently abroad because you say youre Texan; youre American and thats all that matters. So it should not be difficult to update our system to match what we currently have; states are no longer the sovereign entities that they were in the 1700 and 1800s. A more powerful and centralized federal government speaks on their behalf, defends and assists them, and ensures equality between them, with states being nothing more than subunits with the ability to regulate areas that the federal government is not in charge of. The election system therefore should also adapt to the present, which is that there are 320M+ Americans, not 39M+ California, 30M+ Texans, etc. The common thread between all states is that were Americans. The head of the executive government should therefore be selected by the people, especially when states are already equally represented in the Senate and indirectly represented in the House (representatives are not at large in the nation, but by delegations awarded based on population).","title":"CMV: The US presidential election system is a joke"},{"text":"Don't fool yourself into thinking no one is prepared.","title":"Democrats are going to steal this election ."},{"text":"Trust me, I did.

But then instead just discuss the electoral college and want to change to a popular vote. It seems your issue is actually with the electoral college. Currently our electoral process is having all the states host their own elections for president. Each State then counts their votes and determines a winner. The number of votes eaxh state gets is 2+ a population weighted number. Then that state, following the out of the vote, has a set of people who cast the true votes for the president. These are the electoral votes that are submitted and then counted and confirmed on the certification (Jan 6th last time). Okay let me explain some benefits and what this would actually look like. 1st, you've now stripped the states of the power of hosting their own election and choosing their winner. This is now a federal process. Do you think putting that power under the jurisdiction of the president is a good idea? Or more potential for corruption? 2) if we replayed the last election, we would no longer see states being decided the night of. Counts would go on and then, just like with the last election Trump would sue not just a few states he believes he could flip. But EVERYWHERE he can. Find a county with high democratic voter percentage? Get as many ballots thrown out as possible. Ask for recounts everywhere possible. It would go on for months. This is a benefit of our current system. We can safely know the winner of many states out the gate with no point in challenging\\nNow maybe I can't get you fully on board with the current system. But let me propose an alternative. 1) keep but expand electoral college to much larger numbers. 2) the 2 Votes that represent the senators remain winner take all. Win the popular vote in a state, get those 2 votes. The rest remain percentage of popular vote based. So what would this look like: California goes to democrats 2 votes + 63.5% * 52 = 35.02 .

It's a consequence of how the system was set up, somewhat intentionally, but not for the same intentions that currently keep it alive. What keeps it alive is that winners tend not to want to change the system that fot them elected, unless they expect the other side to do better later, in that case, the other side will not want to change it. States elect electors. There is a race to the bottom that leads to majoritarianism/winner take all, the way to maximize the power of the \\"majority\\" (biggest minority often) of that state.

Its expansion hasn't been into an empty landscape, ripe for the taking, but into occupied settlements. If a group establishes a \\"beachhead\\" or a salient into enemy territory, they may \\"defend\\" that beachhead. But the establishment of the beachhead itself is offensive in nature.

To put it simply this is a conflict that was started by the denial of Palestinians land rights that happened in the Nakba and has been enforced through military occupation ever since. Israel has never offered restitution for this crime therefore the moral responsibility for the ongoing conflict is wholly on them.Edit: One more thing I might add. From the Palestinian view, the Israeli occupiers are all criminals who have committed crimes that are worthy of the death penalty. They don't just want to kill Jews for no reason or because they're all racist or something. They have good reason to believe the death penalty is appropriate for the crimes they have committed in the past and continue to commit to this day. It's like if you stole someone's house 80 years ago, they came back immediately and tried to take possession of it but you ran them off with a gun and then kept that gun pointed at them the entire time and then all that time later when they get a gun and try to use it to run you out of the house having the audacity to be like \\"hey, what's the big deal, that is all ancient history, water under the bridge, how could you still be upset about that? You just hate me for no reason you no good dirty criminal, how could you try to steal my house using violence, didn't you know violence is wrong?\\". Doesn't it seem ridiculous when you put it on individual terms? So why does that multiplied by 700,000 not also seem ridiculous? Hamas is waging a war that is fully justified on moral terms from their viewpoint as well as the viewpoint of any impartial observer. I don't see a lot of people crying about Azerbaijan taking back territory from Armenia. It's because people understand if you run someone off from their homes with violence, don't be surprised if they come back later and try to do the same thing to you.

Obama is unelectable except perhaps against Attila the Hun, Mark Penn, her top strategist, wrote in an internal campaign memo in March that year. Mr Obama was trying to celebrate his background as diverse and multicultural, but Americans were not ready for that message. Save it for 2050, Mr Penn wrote.\\nThe future arrived much sooner than Mr Penn expected. But then it went on to prove stranger than anyone could have imagined. To attend Kamala Harriss rallies in the closing days of this years presidential campaign is to be reminded what the future once looked like, before the rise of Donald Trump and his destabilising synthesis of atavistic and innovative politicking, of old dog whistles and new media methods, of nostalgia and revolution.\\nMany recent news reports have noted that Ms Harris has shifted from her politics of joy to a more solemn message about the menace of Mr Trump. That is partly trueshe has honed her case against himbut her rallies are still exuberant. On October 19th in Atlanta, Georgia, about 11,000 people, a pageant of diversity, filled the lawn spreading uphill from the stage of the Lakewood Amphitheatre. They all seemed happy. Young or old, singly and in synchronised groups, they danced in the late-afternoon sunshine as a dj played hip-hop and pop tunes.\\nMs Harriss soundtrack tends to be more contemporary, and blacker, than the pop ballads, classic rock and country tunes at Trump rallies. Yet in Atlanta the crowd belted out the chorus of Neil Diamonds Sweet Caroline as lustily they did the chorus of Whitney Houstons Im Every Woman. The seating section reserved for pink-and-green-clad members of Ms Harriss black sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, was among the signs the Harris campaign is different from that of any nominee who came before.\\nBut when the candidate appeared onstage, to ear-splitting cheers, the rally turned into a throwback to a more conventional time. Ms Harris is a strong stump speaker. She improvises confidentlyYou guys are at the wrong rally, she responded to some hecklers recently in Wisconsin, I think you meant to go to the smaller one down the streetbut she delivers only slight variations of a standard speech. This can be a strength. In Atlanta the crowd rapturously chanted We are not going back! as she reached that signature line. When she mocked how Mr Trump described his proposal for health care, she spread her arms wide and made air quotes with her fingers that the crowd filled in by roaring his limp assurance he had concepts of a plan. Unlike Mr Trump, Ms Harris smiles and laughs, warmly and often.\\nMr Trump connects to his audiences in a different way, through the free-form speechmaking he calls the weave. In execution the weave can conjure less an image of disparate threads forming a beautiful tapestry than of a drunk lurching down a pavement. But though Mr Trumps digressions may be baffling or squalid, as when he recently rhapsodised about the penis of Arnold Palmer, a golfer, his storytelling creates a sense of intimacy. Whereas Ms Harris might be on and off the stage in half an hour, Mr Trump can meander about himself and his relationships for nearly two hours. To critics this seems like self-indulgence, but to his audiences it seems like generosity and authenticity, the candidates real thoughts rather than the speechwriters epigrams that signpost Ms Harriss remarks. Whereas her rallies succeed in the conventional aim of commanding local publicity, his often make national news that crowds her out of the spotlight and excites the disaffected voters he is trying to prod to the polls.\\nMs Harris reels off policy objectives and criticisms of Mr Trump, but she is not given at rallies to telling stories about herself. The closest she came in Atlanta was to say I took care of my mother when she was sick, in explaining her proposal to have Medicare cover home health care. But she couched even that experience in generic terms. Its about trying to help them put on clothes that wont irritate their skin, she said. Her supporters hear in such universalising an authentic generosity, a signal Ms Harris is more interested in their experiences and needs than her own.\\nThis approach seems true to Ms Harriss guarded persona, and it also seems intended to supply a soothing, grown-up counterpoint to the melodrama of Mr Trumps unending perils-of-Pauline act. And unlike Mr Trumps messages it seems meant as much for swing voters, particularly female ones, as for her core audience.\\n**Womans work**This was underscored by Ms Harriss choice to campaign with Liz Cheney, a former Republican congresswoman. Together the two made a case against Mr Trump that was not just bipartisan but decidedly female. In Malvern, Pennsylvania, on October 21st Ms Cheney spoke as a mother who wanted her children to grow up without worrying about the peaceful transfer of power. She condemned the misogyny that weve seen from Donald Trump and J.D. Vance, the Republican nominee for vice-president. Describing herself as pro-life, she nevertheless decried what has happened to women since the Supreme Court struck down the right to abortion. It was a glimpse back at what the future looked like when Mrs Clinton was the nominee.\\nBy clinging to the presidency, President Joe Biden put his party in a deep hole. Ms Harris has had less than three months to establish her claim to the office while trying to shuck the burdens of the dismal public opinion of his presidency and of her own former leftist positions. She has made considerable progress because of Mr Trumps own enduring unpopularity and because, unlike Mr Biden, she has promised to give Americans back their old idea of the future. The question is how many still have faith in it.","title":"Kamala Harriss closing argument: Her vision of the future is also a nostalgic one.

Those things combined make it very politically difficult for the government to oppose Israel - particularly during an election. And Bibi knows this and is turning the screws. He also has his own shit going on and doesnt want to relinquish power - the war gives him opportunity to continue to cling to power. I really think a Democratic president could and would flip this around on Bibi after the election. To do so right now would likely lose the election for Democrats.

Why do Florida and New York arabs (large population, low odds of swinging the election) and Arizona (low population) arabs feel voting for Harris is the obvious move while Michigan arabs, probably the only state where a concerted movement among arabs could hand it to Trump, desparately need to make a futile statement, consequences be damned?\\nCards on the table,? I think there's likely been a very targeted social media effort by conservative PACs, and foreign influences to push this idea as though it was from within that community, and it's successfully incepted that idea. The fact that Jill Stein, patron saint of astroturfing for leftist causes is right in the middle of it only confirms this to me","title":"CMV: Kamala Harris is very likely to lose the elections due to Arab-Americans voting for Trump in Michigan"},{"text":"Dane here. I know you don't like to hear it, but your voter turnout is too low. Too many of you are sitting at home or don't care about the outcome. That's why it's a close race.Only about 66% of eligible American voters voted in 2020, and I'd bet that getting 10% more to vote would move the needle *by a lot* towards the Democrat side. Republicans are aware of that.The system is rigged to make you apathetic towards voting, and I think voter registration is one such cause (of multiple causes), and it should be abolished. Voter registration isn't normal in democracies and is a system that was invented for 19th century America, where knowing who you were at the polling station was a challenge. This is no longer needed.Republicans are actively working towards making voting and voter registration more ambiguous and complicated, hoping you'll give up and go home.In our last election here in 2022, our voter turnout was 84%, which was considered the lowest since 1990. Voting here is very easy. You don't have to do anything to be permitted to vote.I believe if Democrats is to get better footing in the future, you need to make voting as easy and simple as possible for every adult American.","title":"Kamala Harris breaks her own rally crowd record in 24 hours"},{"text":"Trump seems to be more open to a more moderate role in abortion, but he seems to be flip flopping.https://www.ncronline.org/news/presidential-run-trump-tries-moderate-position-abortionArguably as an outsider, he does have more room for maneuvering.

When a powerful group or state faces scrutiny over human rights abuses, it can be tempting to point to other crises, implying that the existence of these conflicts somehow diminishes the severity or legitimacy of criticism against their own actions. This tactic doesnt resolve the issue or address the specific grievances in questionit merely deflects.Yes, its true that many conflicts around the world warrant attention. The ongoing civil war in South Sudan, the crisis in Haiti, and many others are each serious and devastating. However, theyre not reasons to overlook the particular global relevance of the Palestinian issue or to dismiss it as unworthy of attention.The Israel-Palestine conflict resonates globally not only because of its enduring human rights issues but also because, much like the Ukraine crisis, it touches on larger geopolitical themes. These conflicts represent key flashpoints in a broader confrontation between Western hegemony, neocolonial practices, and global power dynamics. Just as Ukraine highlights tensions between Western and Eastern blocs, the Palestinian issue illuminates the complexities of Western supportparticularly from the U.S. and U.K.for a state engaging in actions that many view as colonial in nature.Moreover, Western countries' nearly unconditional support for Israel  reflects a double standard in how principles like sovereignty, self-determination, and human rights are applied. When people critique Israels policies toward Palestinians, theyre often pointing to this contradiction in Western foreign policya policy that unflinchingly condemns similar actions in other contexts but provides tacit approval or support in this case.The fact that these critiques persist and resonate widely isnt due to misplaced anti-whiteness or selective empathy but because the situation embodies unresolved questions about human rights, justice, and power imbalances on the global stage.","title":"CMV: I believe the Israel-Palestine conflict would be old news not really talked about anymore if there wasn't a perception that Jewish people are white"},{"text":"please repost this one todays daily chat - this was like 3Am EST.

During the late 1980s, the British government secretly granted Coventry-based engineering company Matrix Churchill permission to sell parts to Iraq for use in their weapons programs, while several UK firms sold components to Canadian engineer Gerald Bull for Project Babylon. In March 1990, a case of nuclear triggers bound for Iraq was seized by HM Customs and Excise at Heathrow Airport. The Scott Report uncovered much of the secrecy that had surrounded the \\"Arms-to-Iraq\\" affair, as it became known when knowledge of UK arm sales to Iraq became public.*_____the 2002 dossier - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_Dossier  *However, two sections later became the centre of fierce debate: the allegation that Iraq had sought \\"significant quantities of uranium from Africa\\", and the claim in the foreword to the document written by British Prime Minister Tony Blair that \\"The document discloses that his military planning allows for some of the WMD to be ready within 45 minutes of an order to use them.\\"**Britain's biggest selling popular daily newspaper, The Sun, subsequently carried the headline \\"Brits 45mins from doom\\", while the Daily Star reported \\"Mad Saddam ready to attack: 45 minutes from a chemical war\\", helping to create the impression among the British public that Iraq was a threat to Britain.*those that remember, will remember the 45 minute claim, and the consequences of that claim being made.\\n_____the dodgy dossier (2003) - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Dossier  *...much of the work in the Iraq Dossier had been plagiarised from various unattributed sources including a thesis produced by a student at California State University. The most notable source was an article by then graduate student Ibrahim al-Marashi, entitled Iraq's Security and Intelligence Network: A Guide and Analysis.**Whole sections of Marashi's writings on \\"Saddam's Special Security Organisation\\" were repeated verbatim including typographical errors, while certain amendments were made to strengthen the tone of the alleged findings (e.g., \\"monitoring foreign embassies in Iraq\\" became \\"spying on foreign embassies in Iraq\\", and \\"aiding opposition groups in hostile regimes\\" became \\"supporting terrorist organisations in hostile regimes\\").**In its opening paragraph the briefing document claimed that it drew \\"upon a number of sources, including intelligence material\\". Before the document's release it had been praised by Tony Blair and United States Secretary of State Colin Powell as further intelligence and quality research. The day after Channel 4's expos, Blair's office issued a statement admitting that a mistake was made in not crediting its sources, but did not concede that the quality of the document's text was affected.*","title":"The 3 stories of Iraqi WMDs"},{"text":"Gotta love how this is the behavior of a lot of the left.

The Israeli government without a doubt does partake in settler colonialism in the West Bank. They quite literally identify Israelis living in the West Bank as settlers. WB land is annexed, settled and its original occupants homes are emptied and sold to the highest bidder with no compensation provided to Palestinians. To make matters worse, this land is often auctioned in synagogues and Jewish community centres outside of Israel, in the US/Canada - countries with a history of colonialism. These are facts that are pretty indisputable. Those settlements are also seen as illegal almost universally, including by Israeli allies. Up until 2005, Gaza was subject to Israeli colonization as well. The US support for a nation actively participating in illegal settlements on foreign/sovereign land is seen as particularly in poor taste given their own history of colonialism. The fears that Israel will colonize Gaza again in the name of self defense are well founded in their history and military strategy. Though I do agree that the Israeli population is ethnically diverse, I think its disingenuous to conflate anti-colonialism with anti-whiteness and antisemitism. Non-white populations are also capable of colonization and being non-white does not excuse one of that crime. You can be pro-Israel but also denounce their settlements. 2. Israel is an important ally to NATO, namely to the US. The US has maintained a vested interest in the region for decades and American taxpayer money directly contributes to their current war machine. American taxpayers thus have a vested interest in this conflict. Much like Iraq, Afghanistan, Korea, Vietnam and a lesser extent, Yugoslavia. Given Israels far superior military, the standard to prevent civilian casualty is also much higher. Americans typically care more about wars in which their institutions are directly involved vs not. Syria is another good example where US coverage was constant for many years because well, its American taxpayer dollars. 3. The Israel-Palestine war is also unique in that having a favourable opinion of one side results in extreme backlash from the other. All nuance is lost. For example, one side sees IDF criticism (the army of a democratically elected ally) as antisemitism, pro-Hamas and pro-Jewish erasure. Conversely, being anti-Hamas and pro-military action against a designated terrorist group is immediately seen as being in support of civilian murder and collective punishment. Conflicts like Russia/Ukraine are much more black and white. 4. The role of propaganda and government/institutional censorship. It would be naive to assume that both sides of the conflict arent marred with propaganda. Acknowledging that, criticism of Israel by civilians in the US has led to disproportionate amount of censorship. Such as in universities, schools, private businesses and government institutions. This leads to more sympathy for what appears to be the underdog.","title":"CMV: I believe the Israel-Palestine conflict would be old news not really talked about anymore if there wasn't a perception that Jewish people are white"},{"text":"The ones who quit did exactly that.Those are the ones we have to worry about.","title":"Washington Post Readers Revolt Over 'Shameful' Decision to Not Endorse Kamala Harris"},{"text":"I'm just not buying that Arab Americans are finding Trump favorable.

So while you may try to push Trump being rich as a bad thing. I believe it to be the opposite.

Why does it exist at all? The answer is because colonialism was historically perpetrated by white countries on non-white countries and beliefs of white supremacy were a cornerstone of the ideology that facilitated colonialism and its entire rationale. The narrative went something like \\"these poor savages need to be conquered and enslaved in order to become proper civilized peoples\\". The attitudes you're talking about only arose as a reaction to those beliefs of white supremacy and the evils that they they enabled. People began to push back against those narratives Colonialism and white supremacy are forever tied together at the hip thanks to the historical precedent set where white supremacist beliefs enabled colonialism. That's why it's waaaay off base to say that people are just accusing Jews of being colonizers or oppressors because they are white. First off the only reason anyone has a problem with white people is because of their association with colonialism and use of white supremacy as the ideological underpinning for said colonialism. Secondly, and more importantly they are literal actual colonizers who are occupying territory that they took from the natives via military force. They drove them off their land, stole their stuff, then bulldozed their homes and built new ones there and said the original inhabitants couldn't come back. It literally is just one more example of white European colonizers using their superior technological ability to exploit and oppress less advanced indigenous people. They're getting accused of what they are guilty of. Whether you want to call them white or Jewish is ultimately completely meaningless and moot.","title":"CMV: I believe the Israel-Palestine conflict would be old news not really talked about anymore if there wasn't a perception that Jewish people are white"},{"text":"On the podcast with trump.

Iran was/is terrified of Israel normalizing relations with the rest of the Middle East because it effectively isolates them. Without Hamas/Hesbollah/random terrorists they have little for allies in the region and their posturing seems hollow. Theyre also still a while away from a nuke.The move of the embassy to Jerusalem and the Abraham Accords helped put I/P in this position today. Both of these happened under the Trump administration. Coincidentally he was also responsible for removing pressure on Israel for settlements in the West Bank, which Biden promptly put back and has only further ramped up since October 7th. You can also argue Bibi is not eager to get ANY cease fire deal cause hes trying to wait out the US elections hoping Trump will win so he can proceed with his aims unburdened and get his own reelection secured as a war time PM.The suffering is awful, you can be mad at the weapons shipments (some of which are literally mandated by congress btw).

Wiltshire Wildlife Trust is re-meandering the River Were at Smallbrook Meadows Nature Reserve to allow water to flow over onto the fields rather than down stream. Originally, the river had been artificially straightened to make it flow faster. Connor Stapleton-Goddard at the Trust said: \\"We want the rain to spill over the land where we want it to rather than funnelling all that water down stream where it's flooding towns or cities.\\" Flooding has become more frequent with climate change, the Trust said Rebecca Clay from the trust added: \\"If you look one side of the bridge, the river looks straight, and if you look on the other side you can see that's where we started to re-meander the river. \\"It helps with soil erosion, biodiversity and habitats for creatures, things that are really important to us in the Trust.\\" Work to re-wiggle the river will include digging new ditches and reducing the banks in certain places. Mr Stapleton said: \\"What we're seeing in the light of climate change is an increased variability in rainfall patterns, and with that you get increased rainfall events. \\"The drainage systems just aren't able to cope with it.\\" He added that they are looking at long-term funding for the project. \\"We're not expecting land owners or farmers to give up their land for nothing.\\"!ping ECO&amp;UK","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Hell yeah, the President who couldn't rein in his party that tried to eliminate free speech during McCarthyism.

The numerous fossils of the animal now known as Quaestio simpsonorum also show clear left-right asymmetry, concrete evidence of when complex lifeforms took shape on Earth. This fossil find is significant, as the preservation of soft-bodied marine animals from the Ediacaran period C which spanned 635 to 538 million years ago C is incredibly rare, and of the 100 or so species we know of, this mobile, round marine animal confirms the evolution of bilateral symmetry, which is a hallmark of most flora and fauna that exists on the planet today. The animal is a little smaller than the size of your palm and has a question-mark shape in the middle of its body that distinguishes between the left and right side, said Scott Evans, assistant professor of geology at Florida State University. There arent other fossils from this time that have shown this type of organization so definitively. This is especially interesting as this is also one of the first animals that was capable of moving on its own. One of the most exciting moments when excavating the bed where we found many Quaestio was when we flipped over a rock, brushed it off, and spotted what was obviously a trace fossil behind a Quaestio specimen C a clear sign that the organism was motile; it could move, said researcher Ian Hughes, a Harvard University organismic and evolutionary biology graduate student. While we know of many Ediacaran species, this little sea vacuum is a significant find C because, unlike the others, its ridged back with a question-mark-like indent detailed clear left and right sides. Bilateral symmetry is the predominant trait of Earth's extant species, which provides a timeline of evolution from more than half a billion years ago to the present day. What is really exciting about this fossil is that its basically bilaterally symmetrical, which means its right side mirrors its left side, but then it has an asymmetrical element that forms the shape of a backwards question mark, said researcher Mary Droser, a professor at the University of California. This sort of symmetry indicates a certain level of genetic complexity. Humans are bilaterally symmetrical but have a number of asymmetries, for example the location of the heart and appendix. A number of other such asymmetries are found throughout the animal kingdom - this appears to be one of the first organisms to organise itself in that way. \\"Its incredibly insightful in terms of telling us about the unfolding of animal life on Earth, Droser said. Were the only planet that we know of with life, so as we look to find life on other planets, we can go back in time on Earth to see how life evolved on this planet. Studying the history of life through fossils tells us how animals evolve and what processes cause their extinction, be it climate change or low oxygen. The discovery is also an important one in terms of better understanding the role genetics has played in the evolution of simple single-celled organisms to complex animal life. As the oldest fossil animals, the Ediacara biota, can tell us a great deal about early developmental processes, Evans said. Determining the gene expressions needed to build these forms provides a new method for evaluating the mechanisms responsible for the beginnings of complex life on this planet. \\"Because animals today use the same basic genetic programming to form distinct left and right sides, we can be reasonably confident those same genes were operating to produce these features in Quaestio, an animal that has been extinct for more than half-a-billion years.\\" The research was published in the journal Evolution &amp; Development.!ping BIOLOGY","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"That's my thinking.

The Department of Education under Title IX actually does specify that colleges receiving federal funding follow certain standards to assume a fair process for both the accused and accuser. In the 2024 Title IX Rules Overview the DOE specifies that: A schools grievance procedures must include a presumption that the respondent is not responsible for the alleged sex discrimination until a determination is made at the conclusion of the schools grievance procedures.andIn evaluating the parties evidence, a school must use the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof.The fight over how Title IX investigations should be organized is a whole thing and way too involved to go into in this reply, but the Obama admin actually wasn't particularly liberal in their approach, and kowtowed to progressive grievances.

The recoveries derive from investigations concluded by the division from Jan. 20, 2021, through Sept. 30, 2024.  \\n...  \\nThe division enforces some of the nations most foundational labor laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act that requires payment of a federal minimum wage and overtime wages, as well as laws that require prevailing wages for federally funded and assisted contracts. The agency prioritizes helping workers in low-wage, high-violation industries, including healthcare, agriculture, construction and many others.Joely Maniscalco is one of many workers who the division has helped get back their hard-earned wages. A home health aide in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, she works to care for people in their homes by providing assistance with bathing, eating and other activities of daily living. In 2024, the Wage and Hour Division found that Maniscalco had been the victim of wage theft from two different employers and recovered more than $1,000 in back wages for her. I am grateful to the Wage and Hour Division. They helped me understand my rights as a home care worker, she said. Maniscalco was facing eviction and was able to use the back wages to secure a new apartment. Housekeeper Demetria Jones is another worker who sought the divisions help after Jones was not paid for all the hours she worked at a motel in Florida, and she struggled to provide for her family. Jones bravely stood up for her rights and contacted the Wage and Hour Division. I worked hard for my money, and everyone deserves to be paid properly, she said. As a result of the investigation, Jones received more than $2,000 in minimum wage and overtime compensation.  \\n...  \\nIn addition to its enforcement efforts, the division provides outreach and education to employers, workers and other stakeholders to raise awareness of workers rights and prevent violations of federal labor standards. To assist employers, the division offers many compliance assistance resources to ensure lawful employment practices.Statement from Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su:As part of the Biden-Harris administrations efforts to protect and defend Americas working people, the Wage and Hour Division has recovered more than $1 billion in back wages and damagesachieving both justice and economic relief for more than 615,000 workers, said Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su. Thanks to the leadership of President Biden and Vice President Harris, this department has been focused on protecting those workers who need us mostthe hotel cleaners, home care aides, meatpackers and hundreds of thousands more. And by ensuring that employers who violate the law are held to account, we are deterring businesses from exploiting workers in the future. I am so proud to say that we are putting money back in workers pockets and signaling to bad actors that they wont get away with wage theft and illegal child labor on our watch.","title":"US Department of Labor recovers more than $1B in wages, damages for 615,000 workers under Biden-Harris administration | Enforcement milestone puts hard-earned wages back in workers pockets"},{"text":"sleep fetishists smh","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Yes","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"based","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Ive kinda unplugged from politics since Im too busy having fun irl.

Her voice was cold and choked, still thick with mucus.You can call me the Princess. The woman smiled at her, a sharp, feral, predatory smile. Welcome to the Kingdom.Im not part of your Kingdom. I wasnt part of the Union, either. Im no criminal. Im just trying to live my life.

You were happy, because you felt it.Sara swallowed. Felt what?You felt *power*. The woman looked her up and down appraisingly. We need to get you cleaned up. Youre covered in blood, my dear. The Princess shrugged off her suit jacket, turning and hanging it on one of the hooks in Saras closet, then, as she deftly began to unbutton her shirt the rest of the way, turned back to Sara, and stopped, meeting her gaze in a way that seemed almost telegraphed, smug, as though everything had happened as she had expected.

It was a constitutional democracy with three branches of government, just like the US:The Weimar Republic had three branches of government:* Executive: Headed by the President, who was elected by the people for a seven-year term, and the Chancellor, who was responsible for the day-to-day administration of the government.\\n* Legislative: Comprised of two houses - the Reichstag (lower house) and the Reichsrat (upper house). The Reichstag members were elected by the people, while the Reichsrat represented the states.\\n* Judiciary: The judicial system included the Reichsgericht (Imperial Court) as the highest court, along with various lower courts. The Weimar Constitution included several key guarantees and protections for its citizens:* Universal Suffrage: All German citizens over the age of 20 had the right to vote, regardless of gender\\n* Proportional Representation: The electoral system ensured that the composition of the Reichstag (parliament) reflected the proportion of votes each party received\\n* Bill of Rights: The constitution included a Bill of Rights that guaranteed freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and equality under the law\\n* Separation of Powers: The government was divided into three branches - executive, legislative, and judiciary - to ensure a system of checks and balances\\n* Direct Democracy: Provisions for popular referendums and initiatives allowed citizens to introduce bills and force votes on them if necessary\\n* Independent Judiciary: The judiciary was intended to be independent, with the Reichsgericht (Imperial Court) serving as the highest court","title":"Exclusive | Holocaust survivor rips Kamala Harris for boosting Trump-Hitler comparisons, says ex-prez is a mensch"},{"text":"Bruh","title":"Leonardo DiCaprio endorses Kamala Harris for president"},{"text":"No thoughts, just bread","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"Women are not second-class citizens in this country in 2024.

Kristallnacht wasn't until 1938, and mass execution of Jews started in 1941.The ascent of Trump to power at this point roughly parallels Germany in the early 1930's, which Wartski obviously doesn't remember. While he experienced the Holocaust, the question is whether his experiences, as a child, dealing with the most horrendous monster the world has ever seen... whether those experiences at that age make him more or less likely to recognize the early stages of the ascent of another monster.Growing up in a Jewish household with Jewish acquaintances, I found that people in the US tend to follow one of two views on Hitler:a. Hitler was a *uniquely* evil individual, and what happened in Germany is something that could never be repeated, least of all here in the US. b. Hitler, while an evil individual, was not unique; and the conditions that allowed his rise to power could happen anywhere, including in the US, if we are not vigilant. Most Jews (myself included) are hyper-sensitive to Fascist/Nationalist forces in society, and the phrase \\"never again\\" is a mantra seared into our psyche. We're conditioned to recognize behaviors which lead to the rise of Fascism. I would suggest reading Umberto Eco's \\"14 common features of Fascism\\" and seeing how the compare to the modern-day GOP (Eco was born in 1932 and his childhood was colored by the rise of Mussolini and Fascism in Italy).","title":"Exclusive | Holocaust survivor rips Kamala Harris for boosting Trump-Hitler comparisons, says ex-prez is a mensch"},{"text":"Who said women dont have rights now?","title":"Tell me why youre a democrat"},{"text":"Got u boo.

Anyone my age or older with any working memory remaining knows full-well the sun used to be yellow and not white, like it is now. My current belief is they are using refractors, like magnifying glasses, in earth orbit, to harvest the sun's energy for solar power.  They are either doing this for profit, or because they have stated we will run out natural gas, coal, oil, and hydrogen before the end of this century (I'm not saying that's true, but that's what the controllers say), or because we are actually entering a cooling period/ice age and they are attempting to manufacture warmth, or all of the above. The refractors would explain why the sun now looks like a bright, white LED light, and why no one can stand to be out in the sun for any extended period of time anymore, when it used to feel healing. It would explain how people are dropping like flies from melanoma. Every sky-watcher who is old enough knows they spray the living snot out of the sky with aerosols (i.e. chemtrails on a daily basis); this could be to trap the warmth and create a greenhouse effect (which it does), or create a modified ozone (as the magnified sun would surely be damaging the ozone layer), or as a depopulation tool, or all of the above. It is well known there is a patent for a sun simulator. If they patent something (the government), they almost always put it to use. There's too much money in it not to. They have made no secret about \\"wanting\\" to use space mirrors. If they are talking about doing something, it means they have been doing it for at least 20 years already -- that is what a former CIA agent and whistleblower stated in a speech posted on geoengineeringwatch.org.

Personally I find it creepy. Although I certainly have no issue with requiring insurers and Medicaid to pay for contraception itself. Forced abortion and sterilization is far more repulsive. I have no idea what else \\"I don't think somebody should be allowed to go forward with a pregnancy unless they can prove their fitness\\" can possibly mean in practice.It does feel subversive of reproductive freedom that there are women who want to have children, and possibly have moral reservations about abortion and contraception, who are not having them solely because they are poor. The policy suite that maximizes choice (and reduces child poverty) is to support parents with child allowances and daycare subsidies while also permitting abortion and contraception and covering them universally through public or private health insurance.Child allowances and free daycare just offset the *cost* of having a child ordinarily absorbed by parental income. It doesn't really promote having children for women who do not otherwise want to have them. Covering contraception and abortion also just offsets costs. It pays for the procedure, device, or treatment. It doesn't promote abortion for women who otherwise want to go forward with their pregnancy. If somebody is \\"unfit\\" as a parent then that's just a later determination for state social workers. We don't need to forecast somebody's fitness and try to pressure them into getting an abortion by penalizing them with poverty. We certainly should not promote other grossly dehumanizing policies. To the extent people are poor because they are parents, and they are \\"unfit\\" because they are poor, socializing the costs of childcare just takes care of that problem.Basically I think this whole logic of if you want a child you should be financially and socially prepared to provide all the support is stupid. We have free public K-12 schools because we don't expect parents to be solely responsible for educating their children. We're just stingy with other childcare benefits.","title":"CMV: Im pro-abortion.

It's a myth. Every Republican administration since Reagan has shoved trickledown economics down our throats, which has...* caused greater wealth disparity,\\n* added more to the national debt than Democratic administrations, and\\n* left the country in recessions.Subsequent Democratic administrations all pulled the US out of those recessions and ended with healthy economies.  Trump inherited a health economy from Obama and immediately tanked it.  Trump also grossly mismanaged the Covid pandemic causing many pointless American deaths.   Now, while still recovering from Trump's blunders and the global pandemic, Biden's economy is the envy of the world.See...* [New report finds that the economy performs better under Democratic presidential administrations](https://www.epi.org/press/new-report-finds-that-the-economy-performs-better-under-democratic-presidential-administrations/)\\n* [The U.S. Economy Performs Better Under Democratic Presidents](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/democrats/2024/10/the-u-s-economy-performs-better-under-democratic-presidents)Democratic administrations also have added more jobs post Reagan - **50 million** over 20 years of Democratic administrations to **1 million** over 16 years of Republican administrations.**Governance...**Republicans claim to be the \\"party of small government\\".  This also is a myth.  Republicans have built more bureaucracy than Democrats.  GW Bush dragged the US into pointless wars (Iraq 2 and Afghanistan), created the Department of Homeland Security, and pushed through the Patriot Act to spy on Americans. Republicans now want to track every woman's menstrual cycles and build internment camps for Trump's immigrants and Trump's enemies.Republicans also claim to be the the \\"party of law and order\\", another myth.   Not only is it a myth, it is a sad joke for a party that supports Trump, who is an adjudicated rapist and was convicted by a jury of his peers on 34 felony counts for falsifying business records in an attempt to interfere with the 2016 election.He also was indicted by grand juries of his peers for the following crimes:1. Violating the Espionage Act and Obstruction of Justice in Florida for unlawfully retaining and storing documents containing sensitive national security information in unsecured areas thus exposing them to unknown people, and for criminally avoiding attempts by the US Government to retrieve them.\\n2. Conspiracy to Defraud the United States and Conspiracy Against Rights in DC for his attempted coup after losing the 2020 election where he also unleashed a violent mob on the Capitol.\\n3. RICO conspiracy in the state of Georgia for his attempt to overturn the will of the people and steal their votes.Trump has avoided timely trials for these indictments only by gaming the justice system with frivolous appeals while also getting help from the presiding MAGA judge Aileen Cannon with her improper dismissal of the Florida case, which will be successfully appealed, and the MAGA SCOTUS with their ridiculous immunity decision.**Society...**Democrats are constantly accused by the right of being \\"radical extremists\\" and \\"Woke\\".  What the fuck do those even mean?  What makes Democrats so radical?* Is it believing people should be able to love who they choose without judgement or prejudice?\\n* Is it allowing trans people to live their lives in peace without fear of being attacked?\\n* Is it supporting women who want sole control of their reproductive choices without government interference?\\n* is it wanting to shelter and help those fleeing repression or horrific conditions in their own countries?\\n* Is it protecting public education and the rights of children to learn freely without limitations based on religious and bigoted ignorance?\\n* is it requiring a separation of church and state as defined by the 1st Amendment?Theses are not radical positions to me.  They are based on intelligence, common fucking decency, and having compassion for fellow humans.Furthermore, these are only **issues** because Democrats are forced into pushing back against Republican religious, homophobic, misogynist, racist, and xenophobic extremists who simply cannot allow others to live their own lives, and who are trying their damnedest to turn America into some sick version of the Republic of Gilead (from *The Handmaid's Tale*).  If you haven't already read the novel, or watched the Hulu TV series, I urge you to.  It paints a glaring picture of the hellscape that Republicans and Project 2025 will create if given power.In short, Democrats believe in personal freedoms and expect a fiscally-responsible, functioning government that protects the greater good and needs of the many as opposed to only the utra-rich and large corporations. Recent examples of these under the Biden administration include:* capping prescription costs,\\n* requiring airlines to refund customers for cancelled flights,\\n* enforcing net neutrality on ISPs,\\n* eliminating data caps imposed by ISPs, and\\n* requiring businesses to simplify canceling of subscriptions.A Republican administration, and specifically a Trump administration, would never regulate business behavior to protect citizens. They gladly will allow businesses to fuck you over with impunity.","title":"Tell me why youre a democrat"},{"text":"I'm assuming this is talking about classical liberalism, which states as a theory/ideal that the rights of the individual, as they apply to every individual, are the basis of moral society.

DiCaprio opened the video by noting that the devastating hurricanes that recently struck Florida, Georgia and North Carolina were some of the strongest ever recorded. These storms have done an estimated $100 billion in damage, and make no mistake, these unnatural disasters were caused by climate change, he said. Donald Trump continues to deny the facts. He continues to deny the science. He withdrew from the Paris climate accords and rolled back critical environmental policies. Now hes promised the oil and gas industry that hell get rid of any regulation they want in exchange for a billion dollar donation. Climate change is killing the earth and ruining our economy. We need a bold step forward ti save our economy, our planet and ourselves. Thats why Im voting for Kamala Harris. She helped lead the most significant climate action in U.S. history, including passing the Inflation Reduction Act. Under her leadership, we set ambitious targets for achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and building a green economy that not only creates jobs, but also helps save our planet. He said that he would be voting for Harris because we cannot afford to go backwards.

I do, and think it's about time we acknowledge the things that have been done to Indigenous people.

Regardless, while white men without a college degree have always been Trumps base, his support from this demographic seems to keep growing. Republicans perform better with men than women among all races, but Democrats rely on receiving the votes of an overwhelming majority of black voters, a trend which appears to be weakening among black men. Further, Hispanic support for Democrats continues to erode, led by Hispanic men. In 10 years or less Hispanics could vote for both parties evenly or even vote majority Republican. In short, Democrats need to staunch the bleeding of male voters, and for that matter their wives, but they are comically unqualified to do so.\\"","title":"Man-Hating Proves Unpopular with Men - The Democrats' Comical Courting of the American Male | This is a culture war centric post, but I think that it is worth a read and a commentary on how self-destructive the Democratic Establishment has become in its campaign strategy"},{"text":"Collect my winnings.","title":"What is the first thing you will do if Kamala Harris wins the presidential election?"},{"text":"Do you think they're waiting til later?","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: October 25, 2024 - 11 days until election day!"},{"text":"It doesnt matter if you dont go vote.","title":"Kamala Harris breaks her own rally crowd record in 24 hours"},{"text":"She ran out of other things to blow!","title":"Democrats Freaking Out, Fear Kamala Harris Is 'Blowing' the Election"},{"text":"Left media doesnt comment on her because shes not really relevant.

So they knew that Israel would stop at nothing to release them, including blowing up their human shields. Do you really think Hamas cares about civilian lives? They also knew that their propaganda machine, ft. Iran and their buddy Russia, could convince already primed college kids to simp for Hamas and condemn the new \\"Zionist\\" (aka 80% of American Jews) boogeyman.Also, not so fun fact... when the college kids consume their propaganda non stop on social media, it actually gives Hamas more reason to use human shields. Why? Because doing so ensures fresh death porn videos for the West's cosplay revolutionaries and help keep them engaged. Not great for Gaza, but good for Iran and its proxies and their delusional holy war.I'm glad you're voting for Harris, but I hope you come to see that the left has been inundated with propaganda as well.

Of course, this also portrays men as Neanderthals who care more about sex than the future of their country. While were here, why do Democrats always say Make a plan to vote? Voting is going to a place at a time. This is how anything in life works, from buying groceries to having your teeth cleaned to watching your kids sports games [to the extent that Democrat voters have children.] Any idiot can do that no problem- literally mentally disabled adults can keep appointments if they are decently functional- but I suppose the person who cant do it easily is a neurotic midwit: the Democrat base. Regardless, the point of the ad is clear: this 65 black man who works in finance will only get the sexual prize of fornicating with these women if he supports Kamala Harris. I suppose all these years after Willie Brown, she still thinks sex is the only way a woman can get ahead.  I think there is an ulterior motive. Playing culture war is a strategy by the elite. The culture war is a diversion from the class war. Contra Mr. Tisdall, I assure you that if male voters cost Democrats this election it will primarily have to do with the genuine support for Donald Trump, the fact that the average Kamala Harris speech is like the worst comedy open mic you have ever seen, and that her status as an incoherent empty vessel cannot be hidden from normal men. However, to the extent sexism is a factor in deciding this election, it will have more to do with the misandry of Democrats than the misogyny of Republicans. Democrats are doing the meme:Tisdall can't understand because he is a chosen one from the rich.","title":"Man-Hating Proves Unpopular with Men - The Democrats' Comical Courting of the American Male | This is a culture war centric post, but I think that it is worth a read and a commentary on how self-destructive the Democratic Establishment has become in its campaign strategy"},{"text":"No, it wouldn't have","title":"Kamala Harris is not perfect, but far better than Donald Trump"},{"text":"We all know why.

As far as I can decipher, the top occultists have differing opinions to some degree, but usually fall under the large umbrella of Gnosticism/hermeticism, and teach that the demiurge is the highest being to worship. Many of the lesser occultist (still the top .01% elites) are atomists and very few are atheist or of a mainstream religion. The great mother (Ishtar) is also a primary deity. The hardest pill to swallow is that most of the world religions DO have real true wisdom at their core, but the truth they are pushing for the population to discover is obviously just a deception.

For those living on border states, I assume this is the biggest reason.(2) Many feel that permitting illegals makes the entire legal process worthless and that it's a slap in the face for those who actually had to go through the entire process [it is.] Additionally, if you don't know whose coming through this does open up a security risk (both safety wise and health wise.)(3) Immigrants tend to dislike illegal immigrants because immigration [legal and otherwise] has the most notable effect of reducing the wages and demand of immigrants.

When I listened to my parents talk about their higher level courses in physics, chemistry, biology, etc. they were always talking about the experiments and practical lessons they got. They got to watch their professors make thermite and got to do awesome rocket launch contests when they were in class. Their experiments/tasks were given weeks of prep time in class and had tons of involvement from their teachers (and they were in a poor middle-of-nowhere school in East Tx).We had some of those same experiments (HS class of 2020, and unfortunately not the thermite one), but we were given a couple days of prepping the experiments at home, a day to collect data, and then 1.5 weeks of writing up the results. Thats just not engaging for young men. Men want to do, they want to see, and they want to learn from those things. And this was in one of the top districts in our state!Im not saying that learning to write well and proper lab reports are irrelevant, but what sounds more beneficial to male students? Multiple weeks of hands-on experimentation, in-class completion of the task objectives, and working with your best friends, or everything being tossed onto their backs, being told to read the book, and the entire process being an exercise of taking time out of your own day to do schoolwork with people you barely know outside of that class?And before you blame my teachers, they were amazing, and also hated the rules and schedule put on them by the school board and PTA (teachers might as well just be removed from that acronym, the parentsespecially the momshad all the power). This also wasnt exclusive to our district. This was the common story with virtually every school district when I met their students (mostly at competitions).Women are (generally) better at what were now prioritizing: socializing independently, combining that socialization into their work/tasks, and setting aside their own time to read their class materials for hours and hours on end. Boys want to get together with their close friends (almost exclusively) and play some video games when theyre not at school. Boys have the same capacity for thought and learning, but our way of teaching has been shifting farther and farther away from the methods that support their learning tendencies.P.S.: Your username is great!","title":"I visited JD Vances hometown.

It's not much, but it's slowly educating people and a silent signal to show support to survivors and their families and that we  (Canadians) expect the government to acknowledge what they did and the many things they still need to do. I do happen to care about Truth and Reconciliation Day, but I'm also annoyed at how long it's taken to Government to create the day and to acknowledge the Call to Actions and many things that are still happening. Don't shit all over me just because I don't trust the government and know it Truth and Reconciliation should have been created decades earlier or even getting land acknowledgements adopted as a practice to show respect. (I know that some people think land acknowledgements are irrelevant or performative, but I think it reminds people that Canada is \\"Our home ON native land\\", as Jully Black sang. People in politics and in positions of power need to be reminded of how there are many Call to Actions left to address. My point in posting about Orange Shirt day was because I think the communities affected should have a voice to share their stories, there is alot of power in that, even if it is a considered a grassroots movement. It was literally the rise of Orange Shirt Day gaining attention that pressured the government into creating Truth and Reconciliation Day a few years ago.","title":"Biden delivers \\"long overdue\\" apology in Arizona for Indian boarding school atrocities"},{"text":"White people are 60-70% of the country(depending on how you define white) and Democrats actively deride them.

This is NOT a pro list for Trump. We had 4 years under Trump, he has a record, many hate his record, many more (by the polls) liked his record. Some don't like it, I wish we spent less, but it is what it is. I don't believe she has any foreign policy experience or expertise. She does not seem well equipped to handle any international diplomacy. Trump is a bull in a China shop. But also nothing happened under Trump. US has looked very weak under her and Bidens administration. I don't believe that her or the Biden energy policy addresses the global challenges of international actors and their incentives Vs. the US. I believe in climate change but EV mandates need to be implemented cautiously if at all. She was anti fracking, now she is pro fracking. Which is it? I don't think Kamala understands economics. She talks about an opportunity economy and that's it. Trump incorrectly talks about broad based tariffs and I think that while that is a brushstroke statement he will probably use targeted tariffs as a threat to undo legacy EU and Japan Marshall plan tariffs that are unfair. All I hear from Kamala is fair share from the top 1% who already pay 25% of taxes (and it's like 50% net taxes paid by the top 5%).I think the lack of clarity on a border policy is terrible. She hated the wall because it was racist, now she wants it. Which one is it? Where was Biden wrong, or right? What is her difference? She was a prosecutor but she has rhetoric in the past of bailing out people who committed violent  crimes. She cannot take a clear position on should we pay for gender reassignment for people who are imprisoned who illegally entered this country. How can you not just take a yes or no on that? She does not represent her ideas in a clear or articulate manner. She repeats boilerplate platitudes that have been handed to her by her campaign on a teleprompter. Wrong Track is negative 33% yet she does not say at all what mistakes she has made or how she is different. The current president and administration has to have some responsibility for such a low right/wrong track rating. If it is wrong track and she had no mistakes, what are people voting for if she is the change candidate? I believe she is a poor candidate. That is NOT to say Trump is a great candidate. I just think she is horrendous.I guess I forgot to mention the border but probably because that is obvious and even a Harris/Biden voter knows how ridiculous their policy was on that.
