Rates of physical/mental abuse, neglect, and sexual offenses are significantly higher among state-ran \\"child protective services\\". It is one of those things that people just don't like to talk about.  But it is why it is so horrifying to have CPS take away children from parents over petty reasons.... like letting a 12 year old walk around by themselves in the park or children seized through unproven accusations from schools or neighbors.It is essentially throwing the children to the wolves.Even incompetent parents are better. So one of the things that is important to understand in these sorts of discussions is that the current \\"solution\\" doesn't work.   That is we are not discussing something that functions and we are going to replace it with a theoretical framework that may work... We are talking about a situation were the current system is broken, quality is highly variable depending on location and who is in charge...  and we are looking for something better.   Or to reform it into something better. Fundamentally we need to have local solutions for problems like this.  It is unlikely that a approach will work equally well across all situations and communities. It is important, as well, for extended family and local community to be aware of what is going on and keep a eye on children as well.   Because how else would one know if anything very bad going on?Any potential solution also has to have due process.  This is a hard requirement.  No just kidnapping children based on accusations.  It is up to 'the system' to prove guilt of the parents. \\nIn many cases of neglect or abuse it is simply because the parents are incapable or unable or unwilling to care for the child properly.  They see their child as little more then a burden or inconvenience. In most of those cases it should be possible to convince them to surrender their parental authority, even if it is partially.   For example you could simply pay them off.  If they are willing to accept money in exchange for surrendering their children to a relative or charity then that would probably be the cheapest and most effective way to go about it.  It would only be in extreme cases were it would be necessary to use violence to remove a child from a abusive parent.  Seize the child, seize their property, and essentially exile the parents from the community.  Since you are dealing with a Libertarian-type-place were roads and communities are privately owned you can do things like that.  If the bad parents show up you can arrest them for trespassing and use physical force to eject them. Also it can be assumed that 'reputation systems' are in place, which is something that discussed quite often.  A private reputation system doesn't have force of law so that communities can ignore it or people could create new identities for themselves and 'reset' and start their lives over, but they are still would be effective at knowing what type of people you are dealing with.   So the penalties associated with being a degenerate are pretty significant. It will directly impact your ability to exist in polite society, etc etc.","title":"Child protection, statism &amp; Libertarianism"},{"text":"Literally 0 argument that Bidens first two years were productive as shit.

But a more particular reply may be given.Before such a revolution can be effected, the Senate, it is to be observed, must in the first place corrupt itself; must next corrupt the State legislatures; must then corrupt the House of Representatives; and must finally corrupt the people at large. It is evident that the Senate must be first corrupted before it can attempt an establishment of tyranny. Without corrupting the State legislatures, it cannot prosecute the attempt, because the periodical change of members would otherwise regenerate the whole body. Without exerting the means of corruption with equal success on the House of Representatives, the opposition of that coequal branch of the government would inevitably defeat the attempt; and without corrupting the people themselves, a succession of new representatives would speedily restore all things to their pristine order.\\"- Alexander Hamilton or James Madison  Federalist 63","title":"Trumps big Mike Johnson decision"},{"text":"Why would I ever support the death penalty?

College-educated voters are voters with more secure and higher-paid employment and are more proximate to the good economy that this sub is always talking about. Hell, Case and Deaton find that there's a **ten year life expectancy gap** between college-educated and non-college educated voters.Forget about what the mechanisms of that life expectancy gap for a minute. Really spend some time marinating in the inherent injustice in it.That's just the life expectancy gap. I'm not even talking about economic outcomes. I'm suggesting that being insulated from these disparities can make college educated voters unwilling or incapable of engaging in solidarity with working-class voters. Graduating from college can leave a person with a sense, not just that they've earned their place in the economic order, but that those who did not make the same choices as them ALSO earned their place in the economic order.Over Thanksgiving, I started playing a few More Perfect Union videos (their Dollar General one and Right to Repair one in particular) and my very rural family ate them up like candy. It's one of the few times I ever felt on the same page with my conservative family politically. But people are allergic to that kind economic populism on this sub, despite it being quite appealing to working class voters.I made more headway defending trans rights to my family, not by giving them a lecture on the difference between sex and gender, but by reminding them that it's not trans people who are driving up their grocery bill or health insurance premiums, but people with master's degrees and Patagonia vests in some giant glass building somewhere. Working class people are struggling and are looking for someone to blame. This sub wants to tell them that they're not struggling, actually. I think that's the difference you're looking for.

Torrez was not originally a suspect in this case.  One of the girls father, a guy named Jerry Hobbs, was who the who the police zeroed in on.  Hobbs actually CONFESSED to the murders after the police allegedly used rather questionable interrogation tactics.  Hobbs was charged and was facing the death penalty himself (back when Illinois had it) until forensic evidence came back and implicated Torrez years later shortly before Hobbs was going to go on trial for his life.  Torrez came back to Lake County, Illinois after he had already been sentenced to death for killing the Navy servicewoman and plead guilty to the murders and got life sentences (the killing of the sailor in Virginia is what got him the death penalty).  If Torrez was more careful about leaving his DNA behind, who knows what could have happened to Hobbs?

Was hoping some folks here could steer me the right direction with this question.The Affordable Care Act, to my understanding, means healthy people pay in via individual mandate (no longer mandatory federally, but mandatory in CA, RI, NJ, MA, DC, and still a popular option from what I see) and that lessens the burden when people (often old or chronically ill) need treatment more regularly than healthy people.What I'm wondering is, is there a way to do this on a statewide level? If certain states wanted to set up a statewide healthcare coverage system for their own state (perhaps alongside the federal ACA or to safeguard against its sabotage by the GOP) is it legal? Or is it something that'd be struck down by federal courts (interstate commerce?), or would be lobbied too hard against by insurance companies, or is there just a fear that it'd be too electorally unpopular or drive people away from the state due to cost of living?I remember that in 2012 Romney had to dodge critics that said the ACA was based on something done during his time in Massachusetts. While a statewide ACA would be a hard measure in a swing state, you'd think that a state like CA (solidly Dem) would give it a try. Or maybe a smaller state like DE and MD which (1) is solid Dem, (2) is not going to see people move away to other states due to COL increases, (3) probably pays more $ in per capita than they receive back from the federal govt- as opposed to states facing poverty like MS or WV.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 23, 2024"},{"text":"Dems need to fight tooth and nail against Trumps plans.

Simply put:If social hierarchies are artificial, then it follows that the values of a social group should be enforced equally for all members - for the status of each member is equally artificial, and therefore irrelevant.This is why progressives are quick to eject even high-ranking members that violate group values.If social hierarchies are natural, however, then it follows that members should receive differing treatment based on status.This is why conservatives will handwave the crimes of high-ranking members, while inventing crimes with which to persecute the low-ranking members.Literally: conservatives do not believe that behavior determines whether a person is moral. Rather, the persons status *determines whether their actions are moral.*Donald Trump has many failings; but his assessment - that he cannot do wrong in the eyes of his supporters - is wholly accurate.","title":"Matt Gaetz ethics report says his drug use and sex with a minor violated state laws"},{"text":"Nah, man.

Victim A said that she did not inform Representative Gaetz that she was under 18 at the time, nor did he ask her age.The former Congressman had denied having sex with an underage girl.Mr Gaetz was the subject of a three-year FBI investigation into allegations of sex-trafficking that produced no criminal charges.**Read more here:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/12/23/matt-gaetz-paid-underage-girl-400-for-sex-us-ethics-report/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/12/23/matt-gaetz-paid-underage-girl-400-for-sex-us-ethics-report/)","title":"Matt Gaetz paid underage girl $400 for sex, US ethics report finds"},{"text":"Oh please oh please let them turn on each other and reveal everyone's secrets.","title":"House Ethics report finds evidence Matt Gaetz paid thousands for sex and drugs including paying a 17-year-old for sex in 2017"},{"text":"If I had a dollar every time I had to sarcastically say, nooo.","title":"Trump Organization accused of tax evasion in Panama"},{"text":"Did this make Faux News?

So water is diverted away from the falls upstream of the Niagra river via underground tunnels into two separate reservoirs, one in Canada, one in the USA. This feeds a series of 5 power stations, three Canadian, two American. They generate power throughout the day and drain the reservoir. At night, more water is diverted to the reservoirs, and less water over the falls. They could divert *all* the water. This actually happened in 1969, the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers conducted a study of the falls, part of which was draining the whole thing. You can actually look at real photos of what underneath the falls looked like in November of 1969. The opposite can happen too. Water can be all diverted back to the falls, and none to the power station reservoirs (at least for a while)I'm not sure how independently each side operates, I'm guessing they work together so equilibrium can be maintained. If the Americans decided to take more water(if they're even allowed to), Canada could likely do the same, and the falls would be less active.","title":"Trumps way of thinking."},{"text":"I suppose this is a big part of why Gaetz is the ONE candidate so far that Republicans could say \\"aw HELL naw\\" to.","title":"House Ethics report finds evidence Matt Gaetz paid thousands for sex and drugs including paying a 17-year-old for sex in 2017"},{"text":"first answer why you choose to live in a country where the majority of states allow pedophilia according to your personal definition.","title":"Ethics Report: Fmr.

Immediate ?hangmans fracture, and their neck snaps. However, that still isnt an instant death, either. All it does is break the nervous connection between the head and rest of the body. It doesnt immediately cause unconsciousness. Typically, this kind of method causes asphyxiation, with death resulting from a lack of oxygenated blood in the brain, but that can *still* take up to 3 minutes. There have been numerous accounts of executed (whether legally, or extrajudicially) individuals continuing to make deliberate facial expressions, grimacing in pain, etc.Rope too long: yeah. Their head can come the entire way tf off. Its functionally a guillotining by rope. Also has the same issue as the previous, although at least this way the blood loss is quicker. Much ?oopsiesAnd finally, the last one- rope not properly fitted around the persons neck: the rope slips from around their head, and they fall unimpeded to the ground, potentially breaking a leg.

I oppose the death penalty because it's wasteful of taxpayer dollars which could be better spent elsewhere.\\nMeanwhile people with life sentences are almost always denied this extravagant appeals processes that is extended universally to death row inmates. Without all this extra money being spent on them, it's more likely an innocent person will sit in prison for life than if we tried to execute him.

Trump won because he is a rich guy who is masterful at speaking to working class people despite actively disliking them and thinking theyre rubes. The modal r/neoliberal user (and democrat if Im honest) is either incapable or unwilling to hide that contempt and appeal to that electorate compared to Trump. Another reason is that (and idk if this is downstream of this subs gender composition), but the modal user is completely unwilling to engage with the inherent emotionality of voting. When you treat electioneering as an optimization exercise, you forget how much of it comes down to vibes and sentiment. Trump has very little active policy but he evokes strong feelings in both his supporters and detractors. Ultimately, though, these two problems synthesize into a unique third problem: language. Because this sub is oriented toward policy that most immediately advantages upper-middle class people, and because its users are unwilling or unable to appeal to the emotions of voters, these preferences crystallize into shibboleths that not only fail to land with the median voter, they actually turn them off. The end result is that neoliberals come across as out of touch, eggheaded elites. That smugness was only appealing in the Obama administration, and has come to characterize, for many I think, the defining problem with Democrats and liberals more broadly post-Trump. There are solutions to this, but I think a lot of people in this sub (and neoliberal-adjacent politicians) are so opposed to entertaining them that this problem will persist for another decade.","title":"How can we bridge the cultural gap between neoliberals and the median voter?"},{"text":" Matt Gaetz is a paedophile.He is not.

We're also in the midst of [120+ prefiled anti-trans bills](https://www.advocate.com/politics/120-anti-trans-legislation-2025) in state legislatures.

As with Greenland, at best Trump may want to ultimately negotiate some sort of fee reduction, access guarantees, or other changes...which may be feasible.  Purchase or acquisition of either land areas would require a treaty that Congress would have to ratify.  Even with the current Republican majorities, it's not a sure thing that either would be approved.  The huge cost would be a sticking point with whatever actual fiscal conservatives we have left.

As someone who is very well-versed about the death penalty (and as someone who personally doesnt support it), one of the roadblocks in discussing its use is that a lot of people dont understand what commute means/what a commutation is. Ive run so often into people where, when I mention the prospect of commuting a death sentence, their response is something like, Would you want them to move in next door to you and your family, then?! Because theyre operating under the assumption that lessening a death sentence means that person will be released from prison. That is not what it means; it means the person WILL die in prison just the same, but not by means of execution.And a lot of people worry that a death sentence commutation will eventually lead to a release, but that was far more common in the past than it has been in the modern, post-1972-moratorium era of the death penalty. Nowadays, when it comes to murder cases, life without parole always means life without parole. (In fact, some LWOP sentences are conditional on the inmate never pursuing appeals or pardons again - like, assuredly, they are NEVER getting out.) No ones getting out to continue being a menace to society if their sentence is commuted. None of these federally commuted death prisoners are moving next door to you or your loved ones.","title":"Biden gives life in prison to 37 of 40 federal death row inmates so Trump can't have them executed"},{"text":" It seems fairly arbitrary.Your comment seems to imply that the number of people killed (only killed one or two people) should be the only metric used to determine if someone should get the death penalty.I could think of so many things that would make one murder worse than others. Was the murder premeditated? Was it planned? Was there actually a more legitimate reason (e.g, revenge) or was it based on a hate crime like murder against black or gay people? Was it done against a minor? Was the victim tortured or went through additional suffering prior to the murder? Was there sexual abuse before killing the person? Without actually positioning myself explicitly in favor of death penalty, those cases seem way more justified to go through it than someone who got too drunk, entered a fight with a dude in a bar and killed him.","title":"Biden gives life in prison to 37 of 40 federal death row inmates so Trump cant have them executed"},{"text":"Per [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/matt-gaetz-ethics-report-released/): Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican who briefly stood to become President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to be attorney general, was found by congressional ethics investigators to have paid numerous women  including a 17-year-old girl  for sex, and to have purchased and used illegal drugs, including from his Capitol Hill office, according to a final draft of a comprehensive investigative report obtained by CBS News. Those were among the findings of the long-running investigation by the House Ethics Committee into Gaetz, which concluded the former Florida congressman violated multiple state laws related to sexual misconduct while in office. \\"The Committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House Rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress,\\" the 37-page report concludes.Edit: Congress has released the report [here](https://ethics.house.gov/press-releases/statement-of-the-committee-on-ethics-regarding-representative-matt-gaetz-2/).","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: December 23, 2024"},{"text":"Weve seen this before back in his first term.Trump wont do fucking anything with Greenland, the Panama Canal, or Canada (except possibly cause a trade war) because he cant.Who exactly would he buy Greenland from?

Frankly, if the economy does well under Trump (and not necessarily because of Trump), the Dems will not have anything to run on in 2026. But, if the opposite happens, then that opens a door. The best ally for the Dem Party going forward is Trump himself. If he actually does the things he says he wants to do, then it should lead to real, tangible negative economic consequences. His cabinet nominees are mostly unqualified loyalists. A failed Trump admin in years 1 and 2 will open the door for Dems to retake the house and senate. Dems could then argue that Trump inherited a strengthened economy and promptly tanked it with his P2025 policies. Icing on the cake? Several issues: RFK, Jr mis-management of the health dept and promotion of his anti-vax conspiracies that lead to measles outbreaks among children. Any smack-down by SCOTUS because of how outrageous Trumps claims are. Frankly, if SCOTUS is truly just another MAGA/Trump lapdog, then the country is toast anyway. And finally, anything coming from Putin if he finally decides he wants to cause chaos by exposing Trump in some way. Butits the economy, stupid. Nothing else mattered in 2024. Identity politics were a turn off for that segment of the electorate that actually played a role in choosing Trump. So, Democratsrefocus on getting back the working poor, labor unions and lower and middle class Americans. Hammer Trump and his admin as friends of billionaires.

Trump wants to buy Greenland, but have you considered what makes Greenland a great place to live? It's their social policies, folks! They have free education and healthcare, courtesy of Denmark. Their citizens enjoy a high standard of living, low poverty rates, and a strong social safety net. It's a progressive's dream come true.But here's the kicker: this is exactly the kind of society Trump claims to want for himself, yet he's busy turning America into the opposite. He's more interested in cutting social programs, increasing inequality, and lining the pockets of his wealthy friends. It's like he wants to live in a Scandinavian utopia, but only for himself, not for the American people.Greenland's social policies are a testament to the power of progressive values. They show that it's possible to create a society that's both prosperous and equitable. So, instead of trying to buy Greenland, maybe Trump should take a page out of their book and work on creating a better society for all Americans. But I won't hold my breath.edit: Top info to note about Greenland in the responses are that Greenland is not a nice place to live. It has declining population.

The number of innocent (the Innocence Project is the worst offender of this).I personally think the sheer low numbers of deaths to begin with, coupled with the (likely low) rate of exoneration, etc. really dont make DP policy important at all relative to lives saved.","title":"Biden gives life in prison to 37 of 40 federal death row inmates so Trump cant have them executed"},{"text":"Realize that anything that contradicts their worldview is \\"fake news\\".","title":"Panama president hits back at Trump over canal U.S. takeover comments"},{"text":"Thank you Trump! ??","title":"BREAKING: Trump announces that it will be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female."},{"text":"If the committee found this info on Gaetz, please explain why he hasn't been charged.","title":"Matt Gaetz ethics report says his drug use and sex with a minor violated state laws"},{"text":"Does it involve forcing out the gerontocracy?

Really?Point out a Democrat who is a known pedophile. C'mon. I'll wait.The evidence says you're wrong. The number of criminal charges is vastly higher among Republicans than Democrats. If we assume that both sides are turning a 'blind eye', then convictions are a small percentage of the total number of scumbags. That leaves us with two options: either Democrats are getting charged at a far lower rate than Republicans, or Democrats are much less tolerant of blatant evil and are much better at weeding out the truly bad apples from their own party.Well, which is it?I think the answer to this one is super obvious; the Republican party has been *positively rabid* about trying to make Democrats look evil in recent years. The way they targeted Hunter is a perfect example - the 'witness' they used to link him to crimes of any substance (beyond owning a gun - which just makes me cackle every time a Republican brings it up) is now being charged with lying to the FBI (a federal crime) because nearly everything he told them about Hunter's \\"illegal business dealings\\" is a lie.Look back at Hillary. What was the 'great mistake' that Republicans charged her with? A private email server. The charge was so minor that the FBI ultimately declined to prosecute because they knew she would settle for a slap on the wrist. Yet the Republican base was positively rabid to 'lock her up'.No, the Republican party has been grasping at straws to try and make Democrats look evil in order to justify their own corruption. \\"Everybody does it\\" is a piss poor excuse, but the cover it offers is just enough that everyone looking for a reason to ignore their blatantly disgusting behavior can shrug about it and pretend that they aren't enabling the very moral decay they pretend to be in such a panic about.The Republicans voted for an adjudicated Rapist and Felon, one who led an insurrection, who coordinated a months long campaign to overturn an election, who consorts with White Supremacists and uses the rhetoric of hatred. They voted for him despite all of that, making it perfectly clear that they don't give a *shit* about 'moral character'.Is it any surprise, then, that their party is filled with people who are reprehensible?

You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone.

If you have a family heirloom thats been passed down for generations and is valued at $1 million, but the family is not a wealthy family, that heirloom is only worth a million to them if they sell it. The tax system is based on the wherewithal to pay, meaning the tax follows the money. For example, a company makes $100, it would owe $20 in tax on that income. But if they have an employee and they paid them $50 with that $100, then the company would pay tax on their $50 and the employee would pay tax on their $50. Similarly, if you hold a stock, you paid tax on the income you used to buy it, but you wont pay tax on the amount its appreciated until you sell it, because thats when youd have the cash to pay it. Many inheritances arent liquid, so there isnt cash to pay the tax and often keeping the asset itself is more important to the person receiving it, imposing a tax on it would force them to sell it. If you limit the tax to just cash, the people who have that kind of cash would find a way to transfer it as something else to avoid the tax and they could afford to hire a good tax advisor.","title":"CMV: Inheritance tax is morally consistent with conservative values"},{"text":"This whole both sides bullshit is boring.

The participant must be 35 years of age at a minimum 2. Must be born in any of the 50 states, within The United States. 3. Must be a Resident for 14 years or more.The votes are attained through ballots, designated to each state. Because there are different numbers of people within each state, the votes are counted to be as equal as it can be, so the population gets a the fairest possible result for the Election. This process is called The Electoral College. It is the final say on the victory of the US Presidential Election. Elon Musk fits two of the three criteria for the Presidency. He is over 35 years of age and had been a Resident of The United States Of America for over 20 years. However, he was born in South Africa, rendering him ineligible for the Presidency.It is unconstitutional for him to buy the Presidency, resulting in serious consequences should he do so.","title":"Trump Makes It Clear: Elon Musk Won't Be President!'

For Europeans, Right meant social hierarchy. So basically anyone that wanted a hierarchical society like Feudalism was a rightist. But the extreme right were those that wanted a rigid hierarchy where people had defined roles at birth until death. Basically some form of Medieval Feudalism.Leftists were people who wanted social equality, which was very broad. Since Liberals and free market capitalists opposed the kings control over property and restriction of property rights, they were known as Leftists. Anarchism was also the left because the state is considered a form of hierarchy. Anarchism is the abolition of all hierarchies so it was the extreme Left. Socialism and Marxism are somewhere between anarchism and liberalism, and still part of the left.Americans didn't use the Left-Right spectrum at all until the 1950's. Ideologies were defined more on their parties. So it was more common to refer to concepts as a Whig/Republican/Democrat/Jeffersonian idea, but not as a leftist idea. Then the John Birch Society came along and labeled everything as a Communist conspiracy and everything was Leftism. Then the New Right came along and they changed the definitions of Left and Right in terms of minimal government intervention or maximum government intervention.This is why Americans have a huge problem trying to fit American Rightism into the definitions of European Rightism. Fascists and Nazis explicitly called themselves a right-wing ideology because they based their ideas on Feudalism. They wanted a Feudal society that classified individuals into specific roles and then regulated those roles and functions in the economy.But American Rightists don't understand why Nazis and Fascists could possibly classify themselves as Rightists even though they heavily regulated the economy. A rigid social hierarchy implies rigid control of society and rigid control of the economy. So European Rightism is always going to heavily regulate capitalism.If American conservatives classified themselves as Leftists it would make a lot more sense. They aren't Rightists in any degree.","title":"Why did conservatives start calling themselves the right?"},{"text":"Musk is just getting started. Trump is being rendered useless.

This declaration won't affect your friends daily lives. This is about fixing weaponized policies in govt.I guess you've never heard of how changing language changes the law without legislation.

If we don't put a stop to this, it won't take long before anyone who doesn't conform is sent to the gulag.If you don't believe me, think back to how they acted during covid hysteria. They were demanding anyone who didn't take the jab should be rounded up into concentration camps, be refused access to hospitals/healthcare, have their insurance taken away, and have their access to the digital town square removed. During that same timeframe, California democrats (aka marxists) tried to have their civil rights language removed from the state constitution. And then they rioted across the country and destroyed everything that got in the way of their power grab.You may not agree with what trump is doing, but this move is tactical against the bad actors who have amassed way too much power in our country.

These policies included requiring nonviolent illegals who are caught to pay a huge fine *and* learn english if they wanted to stay here. Any violent illegals who were caught were immediately sent packing, hence Obama's nickname the deporter in chief.But just because they needed as many weapons as possible to use against the bad orangeman, those politicians all did a complete 180 and abandoned literally every single policy they've ever pushed for in the past. I guess that's why they prey specifically on the youngest demographics these days, because they're too young to know that those politicians have become complete hypocrites in their efforts to protect their legacy from being exposed.I guess the most shocking part imo is how many voters have lived through it all and accepted the hypocrisy in order to keep their allegiance to The Party? intact.","title":"BREAKING: Trump announces that it will be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female."},{"text":"Yes and no.

The worst thing about this is that his followers agree with him on both, which is why they applaud him when he engages in corruption and fraud, and when he destroys their country's diplomatic position.They, like him, don't realize that the USA's position as a global hegemon depends largely on its network of allied governments and friendly nations (not always the same). People talk a lot about Russia's, China's or Iran's network of allies but all of those are small beer by comparison. Military force, in which the USA also dominates, if a fairly limited tool by comparison because it is politically costly to use and even the USA could quickly overextend itself (as it did in Vietnam, Afghanistan or almost every colonial European state did in the 20th century). Trump and his followers lack this perspective because they are obsessed with status and power for its own sake; they see everything as a zero sum game so if the USA isn't \\"winning\\" from any exchange then it must be \\"losing\\".","title":"BBC.com: Trump threatens to try and regain control of Panama Canal"},{"text":"doctoralJuris Doctor isn't a scientific doctoral degree despite the name, it doesn't require a dissertation.
