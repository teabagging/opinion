Or at least uhhh ignoring the WW2 axis, which were technically all parlimentary-ish systems, sort of.In general though, 1) the US system was intentionally structurally designed + patterned after the roman republic. And includes among other things a strong independent appointed / elected executive, ie the president / consuls / dictator. Although to be clear even the *romans* thought giving a single independent and somewhat / to a limited extent legally immune executive total power over the military et al was a *terrible* idea, which is why they had two of them.Unsurprisingly, 2) the general pattern in *many* US style / roman-style govts - thus far excluding the US - has been for a sitting / elected president to simply seize absolute power over the military and/or legislature, and turn themselves into unelected (or semi-elected) totalitarian dictators, in the post-caesar / post-augustus (and modern / conventional) meaning of the termIn general, directly voting for an elected president every 4 years - ie *a democratic king* \\\\- is a *terrible* idea.While yes democracies are *terrible* at making decisions, in times of true, absolute crisis *they will absolutely* get their shit together.An elected autocrat is ergo *not* necessary. The US house speaker / British PM / what have you should more than suffice.We should also throw out the senate entirely while we're at it, mind.If the people's directly elected representatives make *bad* decisions, they *will* be directly responsible for them. And will, if those decisions were sufficiently terrible, be quite capable of changing their minds.You do *not* need a 2nd chamber to \\"review\\" - and essentially just slow down and block - legislation either.The US form of govt (and its 2nd form of govt) was both an experiment and a compromise. And as it happens history - or at the very least recent modernity - has pretty conclusively demonstrated that the British west minister system - also heavily reformed and modernized over time - does in fact work better, and lead to at least *slightly* better and more sane politics than our system does.See also - or in particular - modern Germany, Japan, et al. Which have quite possibly some of the best (or at least *better*) forms of democratic govt, as young democracies that were built on reflections from past mistakes, *and their own prior mistakes* in particular. And that were, ofc, heavily shaped and rebuilt by the US / US leaders itself, to *prevent* the reemergence of fascism / autocracy from within those countries, ever again.As such, unsurprisingly, they have better forms of govt than we do.Cross reference [this map](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/dictatorship-countries) with [this one](https://i.redd.it/fentxfjscimx.png), and yeah, those results pretty much speak for themselves. Specifically presidential vs non-presidential ones.Banana republics tend to be run by \\"El Presidente\\", *not* \\"El democratically-elected-and-coalition-appointed Prime Minister\\". And that is backed up by *nearly* all available evidence, and pretty much all history of the past 79-ish years.The fact that the US state dept doesn't recommend its own form of govt for emerging democracies makes sense.Like no shit, there's probably an 80% chance that'll directly result in some kind of totalitarian dictatorship.The *structure* of presidential elections both reinforces and leads to cults of personality. Or an unsuccessful presidential run. ie a candidate that just was not popular + charismatic enough. It also directly reinforces 2-party (and above all tribalistic one-party) politics, for obvious reasons.Parliamentary systems sometimes - and often - elect / appoint (note: accidentally or not) people like Kier Starmer to run their govts. There *is absolutely no way* that someone like Starmer would be capable of winning a presidential election. Or turning his country into a fascist dictatorship.","title":"Would you be for reforming the two party system to allow third parties to gain more power?"},{"text":"To be an ally is to acknowledge the struggles of others and agree that its unfair.

It is irrelevant what that person sees on the phone because the system could show a barcode and just record something else. And how do you audit each individual person who scans their barcode. You cant. The voting machines already have software to record a vote and a paper audit trail generated at the same time that is not change able and is fully centrally auditable. This exists with the current voting systems. Fox News lost nearly 3 quarters of a billion dollars falsely claiming it doesnt work or isnt secure. Making yet another system open source doesnt solve the problem because the average person cant read and understand source code. Well do t worry about that, we have experts who will review it. We already have experts review it, some people just want to keep changing experts until one tells them what they want to hear, not that the code is safe because one candidate is screaming from the hills that systems are rigged when they are not to setup a situation where if he wins its a win and if he loses its fraud.","title":"Until we see the source code for all the voting machines, any winner of an election will be illegitimate.

The idea is that a person needs to be independent to have the franchise, otherwise the dependent person will be another vote for the person they are dependent upon. If Person A owns a factory employing 100 people, Person A can coerce those 100 employees, by threatening their pay or employment, or offering them extra benefits, and thus gain undue influence over the affairs of the state. This is the reason that liberal political theory in the 18th century required some sort of property or income requirement for the franchise. This wasn't just about affecting women or poor people either. While many if not most yeoman farmers closer to the coast were producing for market, some were still subsistence farmers, and moreso as you got towards the interior. The subsistence yeoman farmer would have the franchise while the adult son of a skilled craftsman might not because he hadn't yet inherited his father's shop. It was also justified by the concept of virtual representation. The material interests of the son are significantly similar to that of the father, that the father can act as a re-presenation of the son. Same concept for the women in the family. This theory began to die out in the early republican era when the sons of franchised men would lose the franchise, especially because the partitioning of land among sons reduced the property each son owned. These concerns haven't entirely gone away (as it is the topic of this very post wherein the MAGA man assumes he has control over the vote of his wife), but the secret ballot has mostly alleviated the concern. The secret ballot wouldn't be introduced as core element of liberalism until the mid-19th century.Edit: Most of this is what I can recall from Gordon Wood's \\"Radicalism of the American Revolution\\" and \\"Creation of the American Republic,\\" plus some stuff I read at University that I can't recall the source of.

On an election-to-election basis, coalition changes occur through demographic realignments. Over the years, the voter base of the Democratic and Republican parties has meaningfully changed multiple times. And on a vote-to-vote basis, I'd argue that the US has even more coalition malleability than many other countries due to the much weaker party discipline than most Westminster-style systems.That said, I obviously do recognize the sense in which coalition building in multi-party systems can result in extremely different coalitions from election to election. However, in many countries, coalitions do usually tend to remain relatively stable over time, so I don't think we should take it for granted that a multi-party system in the US would automatically result in significantly different coalitions.","title":"Would you be for reforming the two party system to allow third parties to gain more power?"},{"text":"When he was booked in new york they put him at 6'2\\" and 240 lol.

An undemocratic authoritarian state operates exactly how you are describing a democracy. A leader derives their influence and power from having the support of other influential interests under them.

In exchange, they continue to provide their support and loyalty. In an authoritarian style government, these interests would be people like wealthy oligarchs, military strongmen, and Interior ministers. In democratic societies, these interests are rarely individuals, but rather interest groups as a whole. Think of religious conservatives, environmentalist greens, pro-corporate Chambers of Commerce, Union workers and their Local union organizations. Democracy allows regular, everyday people to play a role within the system while requiring that elected officials address the concerns and demands of fairly broad swaths of the general population.

Many of these communities encounter the same obstacles and challenges - being an ally to one group often benefits other marginalized groups. It is almost impossible to support one marginalized or minority group without inherently bolstering the mission of another. A few examples:\\n- Indigenous groups are disproportionately affected by environmental destruction, meaning that supporting Indigenous rights supports environmental advocacy, and vice versa. Advocating against things like destructive oil pipelines being built on Native land inherently supports both causes simultaneously. \\n- POC are disproportionately affected by high housing costs. Working on affordable housing initiatives for all people supports racial justice initiatives, simply because its an issue that impacts them heavily. \\n- Mental health advocacy and working to increase access to mental healthcare supports work being done on prison reform, simply because we jail a lot of mentally ill people. Decreasing social stigma around mental illness and increasing access to care lowers the number of incarcerated people. This could easily tie in to racial justice as well, because POC are disproportionately affected by mental health stigma, limited access to mental healthcare, and disproportionate incarceration rates. You hear the word systemic quite often when people talk about racism, sexism/misogyny, criminal justice, healthcare, housing, etc. The use of this term is trying to outline the fact that all of these issues are interconnected, and to dismantle one, we must dismantle them all.

How do you balance privacy on one hand, and protecting the most fragile amongst us on the other.I think it would make sense to say ? if you want to gamble small amounts here, no problem, don't worry about a thing. If however you want to gamble very large amounts, the kinds of amounts that are gambled by people who ruin their lives, then we need to make sure that's not what you are doing, that you're not one of those people ruining their lives. So we're going to need to have some kind of idea of your income and wealth, please provide some proof to this independent third-party company that will check the documents, and tell us whether we should let you gamble or not ?.I don't think gambling is a fundamental right. It's a privilege. Limiting access to gambling behind some sort of barrier that protects people, to me, makes sense. It's not like you're limiting their speech or their access to food. how much liability a site could possibly face for the actions of its users. That's also complicated. My first instinct would be \\"let's make the gambling sites liable if somebody ruins their life on their site, that'll make them **very** motivated to protect their users from these kinds of outcomes\\".But on the other hand, that's got all sorts of issues, first I'm not sure it's fair to the website, second it might (depending on how strong the liability is) just make it completely not worth it to enter this business at all, and third it might be a recipe for people abusing the system, gambling their life savings away, then once it's lost, suing the website to get it back.But then again, if the betting sites properly protect their users, they should not have any bankrupted user to come after them in the first place.Not easy.","title":"CMV: Sports gambling has gotten out of hand and needs much more regulation, especially in advertising."},{"text":"Nice. ??","title":"Lakers' LeBron James Officially Endorses Kamala Harris For President"},{"text":"The media isn't to blame they post stories about both but we only read the ones about Trump.","title":"Michelle Obamas Brutal Takedown of Trumps Mental State Shames Media"},{"text":"Was this a surprise to anyone? ?","title":"Lakers' LeBron James Officially Endorses Kamala Harris For President"},{"text":"In that case, do you mind if I *redistribute* your essay?

If your ballot hasn't been marked as \\"received\\" you can either print a new one in some cases. or go down county auditor/election supervisors office to pick up a new ballot. IANAL results by state may vary.The drop boxes have surprisingly good security and fire suppression systems of the two attacks that successfully damaged ballots, only managed to damage three ballots in Portland, and 488 ballots were damaged in Vancouver where the fire suppression didn't work as successfully. According to[ the Times article,](https://time.com/7160713/suspect-ballot-drop-box-fires-oregon-washington/)Elections staff were able to identify 488 damaged ballots retrieved from the box, and as of Tuesday evening, 345 of those voters had contacted the county auditors office to request a replacement ballot, the office said in a statement Wednesday. The office will mail 143 ballots to the rest of the identified voters on Thursday.Six of the ballots were unidentifiable, and the office said the exact number of destroyed ballots wasnt known, as some may have completely burned to ash.Police and campaign workers have also dramatic increased surveillance and patrol efforts for the boxes.Sorry I know this has already been a wall of text, but the aftermath of this election is going to be a nightmare, so we need to be careful discussing the scale of the attacks so far.As far as placing blame, there's early evidence that Free Gaza was written on at least two of the devices and Free Palestine on package or something device related, sorry reports I read weren't super clear. Law enforcement are doing their best to remind everyone the have literally no idea if that was a honest motive or an attempt to sow confusion.

CBS, NBC and ABC have to meet a different standard. They operate on Americas public airwaves. They have to remain impartial. The FCC regulates local broadcast news. They do not regulate cable news. That regulation comes with a whole host of rules that can easily be looked up. Here are some of the differences:Local broadcast news:\\nThe FCC has a policy against news distortion for local TV and radio stations. This policy prohibits broadcasters from deliberately distorting factual news reports. The FCC also regulates the words broadcast over the airwaves, prohibiting broadcasters from intentionally distorting the news or broadcasting false information about a crime or catastrophe. \\n \\nCable news:\\nThe FCC does not have jurisdiction over cable news networks, newspapers, newsletters, social media platforms, or online-only streaming outlets. Cable news networks are not subject to the same regulations as local broadcast news because they are not broadcast over the publics airwaves. Cable news networks can often get away with opinions on their shows, which can be for entertainment or political persuasion.","title":"Donald Trump sues CBS News for $10 Billion alleging 'deceptive doctoring' of Kamala Harris' '60 Minutes' interview."},{"text":"lol hmm, I cant seem to comment in that sub.

There is a lot of nuance to it. But it ultimately happened because it came down to 537 votes. The true thief in that election was Nader. 2020 only held water because of how long it took to count the votes and how close it was. There was doubt that was able to be created for the base to latch onto. This is going to be so overwhelmingly crushing that while Trump and his supporters will be delusional, the institutions wont be able to deny it. There are realistic models that show them getting to 300+ in the House and 54 in the Senate. Its also based entirely on whether 5 Republicans dont cross the floor, kick Johnson out and appoint Jeffries, to delay until Jan 3. When they can just Impeech the SCOTUS.  They also wont risk a Civil War theyll lose. SCOTUS is most likely playing Trump, so they have the leverage to get the Democratic Party to not ruin them instantly. Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney have also been planning for this. Theyll split the GOP if they have to. Walz has been talking about IRV, could be a signal to allow a third party to emerge and be viable out of the gate. Cheney and Romney are both loaded. Cheney is deeply powerful in the Oil and Military industries too. Romney is connected to the Hedge Funds (the real powerful people we know nothing about) and the Mormons. There will be politicking sure, but enough Republicans will see this as their moment. Graham, McConnell, Romney are still Senators too. Lots of Republicans in the House also hate MAGA and will betray. Because the vote will be so overwhelmingly Harris that theyll see it. There will be no doubt.

For almost 15 years, the Republican Party position was there could be no health care reform without individual mandates.  Ted Kennedy opposed the mandate so it never made it anywhere.Lately the Heritage Foundation has worked hard to deny they were involved, but its entirely in the public record.The point is, that the Republican objection has never had anything to do with the mandate.  That was always a cover story.  They opposed ACA because (a) it took healthcare policy control away from the employer class, creating career mobility, and especially interstate mobility for families; (b) it guaranteed a right to healthcare to undesirables like gays; and (c) because it ended up being called Obamacare.  Republicans thought they could derail it by attaching it to a black guy like it was still 1957, but the Dems quickly co-opted the term as a brand.

We just cannot predict where all of those likely voters are to even ask them if they are likely voters.

Trump just told you that we were.I should clarify, because I can see how I sound out-of-touch there. Biden's comment wasn't good. Maybe the \\"apostrophe\\" explanation is true, maybe it's not, but at the very least it was a dumb thing to say. And there are absolutely liberal people out there acting smug about it, or vindictive, or whatever. There are MAGA folk who act that way too, of course, not that that excuses it either way. But the liberal *establishment* wasn't relishing Biden's comment. Harris and Walz weren't telling Trump supporters \\"Hey MAGA check this out! You're garbage! Yay, we triggered them!\\" The narrative of \\"they're making MAGA mad\\" was basically manufactured by conservative media. It started with Marco Rubio [getting on stage with Trump](https://youtu.be/DaAk-WHku3g?si=pNSHCRpREsiahMFt) to announce the \\"breaking news\\" of Biden's remark, and get the crowd riled up about it. Another example is [Brett Favre](https://youtu.be/gYaH8vvGmwo?si=NY8aJkUE-KeZs1yH) (go to 3:10 for the relevant part). There are more examples of Trump surrogates making the same point in [mainstream media](https://youtu.be/_zDT4dSbIsI?si=Z1SiZFg4vMQABS6l) and the point being amplified by [alternative](https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/joe-biden-donald-trump-supporters/2024/10/29/id/1185931/) [conservative](https://www.newsmax.com/newsmax-tv/kristi-noem-joe-biden-garbage/2024/10/30/id/1186086/) media. Whether you agree with them or not, the message is very clear: MAGA is mad about this and they are right to be mad about it.So then Trump goes and does this stunt giving the message that you should actually embrace this label and show the divisive libs that they can't get to you. While at the same time, they're [*still*](https://www.newsmax.com/newsmax-tv/sen-ron-johnson-wisconsin-white-house/2024/10/31/id/1186167/) [pushing](https://youtu.be/vdEDFDzhKUE?feature=shared) the message that Trump's supporters are \\"outraged\\" to the point that this may actually affect the outcome of the election! Again, whether you think Biden's remarks were actually that bad or not, the part that gets me is the double-speak. \\"We are outraged but also we don't care what libs say about us.\\" I hope this doesn't sound too crazy-liberal of me to say, but this is a textbook play, except the textbook is 1984. The only word I can think of to describe it is \\"psy-op.\\" It feels like the Trump campaign is running a psy-op on its own supporters and the worst part is that it seems like it's working.Look, I know how it looks for some bleeding-heart liberal like me to step into MAGA world and say that I'm concerned about y'all, but I really couldn't help it with this one. I'm watching half of my countrymen cheer on a man who (to my eyes) is blatantly manipulating and abusing them and the only thing I can think of to do about it is drop the snark and say how I truly feel to the people I think need to hear it the most.Anyway, thanks for reading this Hallmark Original Movie.","title":"Confused Liberal Needs Help"},{"text":"Election interference!","title":"I early voted- straight blue down the ticket this week!

You stopped posting. Seems like you get it now. Now does that link from the heritage foundation make sense? The gop says, we cannot allow the electoral college to collapse. Rural people will never be represented again. Its the foundation of everything weve built on. Now, to be real, the Democratic Party sucks too. Both parties are aligned with the rich. The republicans dont care about rural people, and the democrats dont care about anyone that dont wealthy. If we switched to every vote counted, it wouldnt hurt rural people, it would hurt the rich. Both sides would move more to the left. Meaning, theyd start campaigning on things the majority of people actually want. Healthcare, transportation, taxes, defense spending, housing prices, etc. the majority align on all that. Its the rich that prevent us from making changes to any of those issues, because they spent a lot of money to make things the way they are. Theyre making more money now than they ever have. And if we changed policies, it would cost them billions. And the rich have rural areas by the balls more so than people in cities. Theres more competition in cities. Theres no competition in rural areas. Big money owns everything out there. So republicans are terrified if we start taxing the rich, and spending that money on healthcare and education and stuff, the corporations will leave, and everyone will be jobless. But we know thats bullshit. Because Northern Europe does all those things, and all those businesses are still there. Theyre just making way less profit. Which is fine. Because people are making more money, and spending less money.  They have a higher quality of life, and way less billionaires. Businesses make as much money as possible. Always have. But sometimes we force them to do things that would reduce their profit. And they always survive. Ending slavery, ending child labor, emissions laws, mandatory vacations, workers rights, safety regulations, etc. Taxes and fair compensation are no different. If its law, then they all take the same hit, and the playing field is still level. But theyre not going to give up without a fight. And they have a bunch of nicks fighting for them. Because people who live in rural areas have less of everything. Theres a lot they dont have at all. Theyre simply not equipped to understand all the options. They have wal mart, and the industrial plant, and farms. They have no idea what the hell is going on anywhere. And Fox News isnt filling in the blanks.","title":"CMV: The popular vote is not the best indicator of which candidate would win if the election was decided by the popular vote."},{"text":"Don is done.","title":"Holy smokes!

And only pointing out that it is not a perfect system is obfuscating that it is an improvement to the current system  which initially had more than 2 parties (whig party) for it to function.  \\nThinking of the voter as a resource.  Currently we are a finite unit which the more a party invests in opposing parties that are similar they force the thinning of the resource and then they do not need nearly as much themselvesBy making it so the resource is infinite with the condition that only one unit per candidate is given,  the condition for victory is no longer in thinning out your opponents resources but converting their resources and consolidating yours as well as being the most favored with those who are similar to you.  Because this is a system to organize people, managed by people, mathematically perfect is not achievable.  We need to know our candidates and cannot have infinite choices.

But if we increase our choice from 2 to 6 or 10 we improve the health of the system, create more safe guards, and give a better snapshot of where we stand as a nation by showing what people support via their voteI expect you are aware of all this but I just had to say it to the void.","title":"Donald Trump Just Shat Himself | Kamala Harris put on a display of the kind of strength he understands."},{"text":"Grace?

Fascists need enough people to think they dont need to do anything whilst their government uses the might and violence of the state against its enemiesFor the first time since the constitution the US military has been given the all-clear to use lethal force against citizens as of this week, overruling the constitution. Historys biggest two surveillance undertakings against US citizens were both under obama (massively furthering the 2004 patriot act, and the five eyes program that allows them to get round legally doing illegal surveillance). The gaza genocide, rapidly becoming an entire middle east genocide, is entirely under the current democrat rule. The hurricane response has been nothing to do with republicans. I already covered roe vs wade and if you want to believe they couldnt do anything about it then you also remove any reason to vote for democrats to do something about abortion rights this cycle too. Cop city and other egregious furthering of the police state, including enhanced immunity and relaxed prosecution of civil rights violations, using drones, and using the armed forced to assist the police, are all up under Biden. Harris of course cut her teeth in california where she was an extremely pro-cop and pro-prisons prosecutor who already made a name for herself before running for presidentIdk what you want me to say about trump but ive been clear that the liberals doing nothing about their own partys obvious fascism but then holding the republicans to account when they do it is not going to help anything.

You got kamala out here saying shell build more wall and shell keep burning palestinians and youre cheering herHistory teaches us, as does every revolutionary leader, that the democrats are what allows fascism. Convinced they are good, they are the ones who destroy any material destruction of the state or of fascism. It is not the diehard racist murderers who create the conditions for a fascist state to get to the point where they can enact their policies, its the liberals.

There are a bunch of states (8 I think) that allow entirely vote by mail.  IT gets you nearing 1/2 the population of the country.Secondly, you can layer on that the fact that 43 states plus DC have a larger than 7 day \\"early voting\\" window.  Thats 91% of the population.  4 more have less than 7 day window for early voting.  Thirdly, more than 2/3 of states require an employer to allow time away from work to vote - policies vary a lot.These are a bit comlex when talking about the nation, but pretty straightforward for the state a voter needs to navigate.  Is there a correlation between education level and how hard is to do this?  Perhaps - education level is often an indicator of your capability to navigate a lot of things.  Is it hard enough to be an excuse?  i don't think so - it's not harder than figuring out how to buy and attend a movie at a theater, or to meet your friends for dinner at a place you've never been or to plan a date or a wedding or to pass your drivers test and so on.

This means that a very large portion of the labor force is very impacted by labor laws, and also depend on transportation infrastructure, communications, and other government services to maintain their financial and social conditions.As such, we shouldn't be surprised that older wealthier white men find politics and voting to be very important.With our modern society having multiple social programs dedicated to help less fortunate citizens, one would believe they would be more inclined to also participate in the electoral process, and that they would support candidates that support programs to help their communities... but that's rarely the case.","title":"CMV: There is an inverse relationship between how easy it is for you to vote and how important it is for you to vote."},{"text":"Link to the news article: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/31/trump-sues-cbs-over-kamala-harris-interview-.html","title":"Trump sues CBS for $10 billion over the 60 Minutes interview with VP Kamala Harris"},{"text":"No like Georgia https://www.npr.org/2020/10/17/924527679/why-do-nonwhite-georgia-voters-have-to-wait-in-line-for-hours-too-few-polling-pl","title":"CMV: There is an inverse relationship between how easy it is for you to vote and how important it is for you to vote."},{"text":"Very good intro into the basics","title":"The American people have been manipulated and gas lit for 100 years and counting."},{"text":"If Avengers defeated Thanos, we can help them defeat Trump!","title":"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson and More Avengers Stars Assemble to Endorse Kamala Harris"},{"text":"I was going to say Hey, Ive seen this one!
