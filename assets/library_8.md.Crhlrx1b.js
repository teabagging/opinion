But for those living in the Stone Age, flight would have seemed entirely impossible, given the tools, knowledge, and resources they had at the time. So while its easy to say something is possible now, it doesnt change the fact that at different points in history, it was considered impossible because the right combination of ideas, technology, and conditions hadnt lined up yet.Now, regarding simulated worldsjust because it isnt possible now doesnt mean its inherently impossible. We cant simulate entire worlds at this moment, but that doesnt mean its outside the realm of possibility given the right conditions and technological advancements in the future.To answer your question: flight, in the sense we understand it today, was always theoretically possible within the physical laws of our world. But whether it ever became a reality depended on factors like the right minds, technology, resources, and trial-and-error experimentation. What if those who worked on flight had failed or never even tried? Then flight would have remained impossible. That scenario doesnt negate the possibilityit just means the idea didnt succeed in that specific timeline. This shows that ideas can fail to actualize, but does that mean they are forever impossible? Thats the question I am exploring.","title":"CMV: If thoughts represent potential realities, then simulation theory suggests we are likely already living in a simulation."},{"text":"Just bought 30 to get started","title":"I hope we see little Trump \\"I did that!\\" stickers in EVERY isle in Walmart"},{"text":"She seems nice.","title":"Trump broke her!"},{"text":"You should tell that Trump and his magats.","title":"Trump Cabinet Picks Hit with Bomb Threats | National Review"},{"text":"I was just pointing out that the unpopularity of the GOP Gov in Kentucky helped propel Beshear to Gov his first term.

That's really their only value. They don't lead to a whole lot of wealth, especially compared to the kind of money this person already has. Some people get a lot of satisfaction out of having influence and having the authority to tell people what to do. It's kind of inherent in the human person, part of our survival instincts. Obviously it's stronger in some than others.As a complete navy amateur, and let me say very explicitly this would require me to not have a conscience, it would be a lot of fun to be Secretary of the Navy. Having that kind of access, knowing the secrets, being able to go almost anywhere in the Navy with full access: it would be pretty damn cool.

Even if it's all an absolute lie, it feels better and is easier to digest (insert entire term paper on public education, engagement, and dangers of social media here).It's also what Trump and his cohort are counting on; good people are so tired of fighting the tide that they just give up.I go back and forth myself but more strategically.  If we fight everything for the next four years, then 100% MAGA will blame any remaining issues or democrats fighting Trump.  If we roll over and let him fuck up for four years we might not have a county left and what services will look more like Russia than the US.Where do we focus our energy to blunt the worst or Trump's plans without becoming such a resistance that people think we prevented Trump from doing good.Then I remember that Republicans have been expecting Trickle-down to make us all rich for 50+ years and still think we just need to try a little harder.

It took time, but eventually, the right combination of factorssuch as the right minds working on the problem, the development of key technologies, and trial-and-error testingcame together to make it a reality.Of course, its also possible that flying machines could have remained impossible if the people working on the idea couldnt bring it to fruition, or if the necessary breakthroughs never occurred. In that case, the idea might have been abandoned, and our world would be very different.

Trump is an evil person after all.  And if we go into the situation with his situation then we lose sight.  But let's think of the idea in a vacuum.We *need* our leaders to have some privileges that an ordinary citizen does not have in order to effectively do the job that is expected of them.  Being imprisoned is something that would prevent them from able to execute the office effectively.  Meaning we cannot imprison our leaders so there needs to be something else that is a work around.  Which there can be a number of different things.1)  Pause the trail until after they have left office. --- logical.  But this might have the real world effect of a person attempting to stay in office longer than they are allowed.2)  Stop the trial completely.  --- At its core laws are a product of what the people allow.  In a way, by voting a politician into office, you could argue that the people are deciding that the law should be swept under the rug for this person to some degree.3)  Have a punishment that does not influence their ability to perform their duties. --- can be difficult as there aren't a lot of options that won't also breed some sort of corruption.4)  Strip them of their office.  ---  Could be abused by an authoritarian regime to prevent opponents from being elected.There really isn't a perfect way to solve the issue.

A small 5% tariff can be the difference between a production facility shutting down due to offshoring and having to expand capacity due to increased sales. Targeted tariffs like this generally have a small effect on consumer prices.If an American industry isnt even close to competing with foreign production, its basically doesnt matter what kind of tariff you put on the product, its never going to bring production back into the states. Think about textiles. A Chinese sweatshop can produce a basic t-shirt, ship it here, and sell it to a local retailer for like 10 cents. If it costs an American facility 50 cents to make that same shirt, youd have to put a 600% tariff to make it even reasonable for an American manufacturer to consider doing the production.","title":"what are tariffs?

Upon reflection, I should clarify my position to avoid overstepping what the argument reasonably supports. My hypothesis doesnt claim to?*prove*?simulation theory or definitively calculate its likelihood. Instead, it aims to **highlight a pattern**: many human thoughts and imaginations, even those once deemed far-fetched, have historically led to advancements that turned them into realities under the right conditions. For the far-fetched ones, like dragons and werewolves, they don't fit in our world, but hypothetically, if other \\"worlds\\" or simulated realities existed, they *could*.That said, the suggestion that simulations are likely does rest on an assumptionthat if we eventually develop the ability to create indistinguishable simulations, the sheer number of potential simulated realities compared to one base reality would imply we are more likely than not living in a simulation. However, youre correct that Ive not provided empirical evidence or a rigorous calculation to justify this step, and that weakens the claim of likelihood. What I am arguing for is plausibility rooted in historical trends.As for your point about the connection between imagination and false ideas, I acknowledge that not every thought leads to realization. Many ideas, like werewolves or perpetual motion machines, remain unrealized due to physical or logical constraints. However, the fact that?*some*?ideas, even improbable ones like powered flight or moon landings, have been realized demonstrates that imagination can sometimes precede innovation. This is the pattern Im emphasizingnot a guarantee, but a possibility worth exploring.So, to refine my stance: simulation theory is plausible based on this historical pattern of imagination leading to innovation, but I concede that describing it as likely may overstate the strength of the argument without additional evidence. Thank you for pointing out this distinction and prompting me to clarify my position.","title":"CMV: If thoughts represent potential realities, then simulation theory suggests we are likely already living in a simulation."},{"text":"Hebrew hammer?

In contesting the fraud, he was aided by Sidney Powell, a lifelong Justice Department operative; the MyPillow Guy, who is a crackhead; and Rudy Giuliani, who is about as shady as it gets.This tri-force of Trump allies came up with a whole load of nonsense, focusing on electronic voting machines and inexplicably claiming that there were hackers in Venezuela flipping the votes. Youll remember (or perhaps you forced yourself to forget) that Giuliani did a press conference in the parking lot of Four Seasons Landscaping after having accidentally booked that instead of the Four Seasons hotel.How is that even possible? Why would a landscaping company with a building on a back lot in an industrial park take a booking for a political event? How would it be confirmed? How would they drive there and set up the equipment without realizing they were not in a luxury hotel, but a filthy parking lot? This was clearly done on purpose.Powell did a massive media stunt where she kept claiming she was going to present evidence of The Kraken proving Dominion voting machine fraud and she never did. The whole thing was a shameful and pitiful mess.It was sabotage.Trump had no real allies and couldnt seem to figure it out himself, but the reality was that the fraud had nothing to do with Dominion voting machines. Its very obvious in hindsight what I was saying at the time: the mail-in ballots that were brought in under the guise of coronavirus allowed limitless fraud. States have the ability to print unlimited numbers of ballots and deliver them wherever they want.Its not particularly complicated. An unlimited number of ballots were distributed, and then they returned. No one knows what happened between the distribution and the return, and no signature verification audits were done, so no one will ever know. But we all saw the boards on the windows at the counting stations, we saw the trucks pull up after the count was paused at 3AM in swing states.There were fraudulent votes arranged beforehand, but it turned out there were not enough to defeat Trump, so they shut down the counting stations and brought in new ballots. It was all done very publicly, with the media relying on the concept of the big lie.We all saw Bidens absurd 81 million, beating Obama 2012 by nearly 20 million votes. In my opinion, it would be impossible for a serious person to claim 2020 was on the level.It may be obvious, but I should note that this fraud primarily took place in competitive swing states, or at least that is the only place it is widely organized. Specifically, we are talking about Democrat-run cities within purple states, notably Atlanta, Phoenix, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Philadelphia.Less understood than 2020 is the 2022 election fraud. This was a midterm election that people obviously considered less important, but it was arguably even more ridiculous than Joe Bidens 81 million votes. A red wave was predicted, due to how disastrous Bidens first 2 years were, but Republicans lost very badly. This was during hardcore coronavirus mania, with Republicans very politically engaged. The entire platform of the Democrats was Trump is on the ballot, which, in light of last Tuesdays events, doesnt seem to be a bad thing.Florida was the one competitive state that actually took action against the mail-in ballot scam. In 2021, Ron DeSantis rammed through the best anti-fraud election law in America, S.B. 90.Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who isnt and has never been very popular, was polling at 49%, and won with 58%, well outside of the margin of error for the polls.Florida is a former purple state, where Ron DeSantis only beat a homosexual African crackhead by a faction of a percent in 2018. Arizona, also now considered purple, has much more history with the Democrat Party than Florida.Florida is a former purple state, where Ron DeSantis only beat a homosexual African crackhead by a faction of a percent in 2018. Arizona, also now considered purple, has much more history with the Democrat Party than Florida.In 2024, Kamala got approximately 10 million fewer votes than Joe Biden got in 2020. At time of writing (theyre apparently still counting), Kamala has 70 million compared to Bidens 81 million.Based on historical trends, it can be reasonably estimated that 10-15 million is roughly the number of fraudulent ballots that were counted in 2020. It is ridiculous on its face to suggest that Joe Biden did better than Obama 2008, which was the previous number of most votes ever for a US presidential candidate (frankly, there had to have been some fraud to get Kamala to 71 million).Its worth noting that while Republicans seem intent on not asking any questions as to where the fraud went, many Redditors and other leftists are very confused by this math. They obviously dont understand the implications in the way Trump supporters would, so they are free to ask the question.","title":"Was Trump Right All Along? 2024 Results Revive Doubts About 2020"},{"text":"Obese blowhard couldnt run across the street","title":"Florida GOP House candidate: Tlaib, Omar might consider leaving before I get there"},{"text":"So smoking it is better?

I can imagine a perpetual motion machine or faster-than-light travel, but these violate fundamental laws of physics. No amount of technological progress will overcome these limitations. The same applies to perfect simulations - they would require computing power that exceeds the physical resources of the universe. Throughout history, many ideas that once seemed impossiblesuch as creating fire or flyingwere eventually actualized.This cherry-picks examples that worked out while ignoring thousands of impossible ideas that never materialized. Ancient people also imagined immortality potions and turning lead into gold. Still waiting on those.The core problem is assuming that \\"thoughts = potential realities.\\" That's not how reality works. The laws of physics don't care what we can imagine.

The computing requirements increase exponentially with the level of detail. A simulation containing conscious beings who could themselves create nested simulations?

However, in a simulation or reality with different rules, assuming that they exist, because I/we don't have empirical evidence -- they could feasibly exist.

As I said you're counting the hits, but given most humans died without their thoughts recorded it's not even possible to count all the misses that dissappeared into obscurity.

If you can't calculate you have no statistical likelihood at all. My argument isnt about proving simulation theory, but rather suggesting its plausibility based on historical patterns of human imagination leading to realizable advancements.?You didn't just give it plausibility you gave it strong likelihood (from your OP) that means over and above other ideas. You even used the word likely in your title. If you had just called it logically possible there'd be no real discussion. But you're going a step beyond that and I'm asking you to justify that step.

Anything supernatural, etc.So there's already a huge gap between (1) and (3) in your argument. I'd further argue (3) in unsupported - proponents of simulation theories seem to take it as self-evident that if simulating an entire universe were possible (which again, we don't know), it would definitely be done and moreover, the inhabitants of the simulated universe would eventually simulate another universe, to infinite regress. This can and should be challenged. Are sufficiently advanced civilizations, if they exist, interested in simulating an entire universe? Do they have the resources to do it? Is there a basis to believe that their technological, computational power is or could be unlimited? We don't have answers to those questions to support simulation theory. Nor, lacking a complete understanding of consciousness, do we know it is reducible to computable parts.Finally, we have the issue that even if all of this is possible, it's only possible if it's also naturally possible for there to be a non-simulated reality in which a civilization can exist and develop the technology to create such a simulation. Which means there is nothing about the reality you could observe, right now, that could distinguish between the two. So, given a lack of knowledge as to how many real universes and how many simulated universes there might be, as far as the information we have is concerned, you'd be just as likely to be in a real universe as a simulated one.","title":"CMV: If thoughts represent potential realities, then simulation theory suggests we are likely already living in a simulation."},{"text":"Randy Fine still the best drag queen name ever","title":"Florida GOP House candidate: Tlaib, Omar might consider leaving before I get there"},{"text":"It wouldnt, because that doesnt involve you receiving financial support from the government.

Think how everyone reacted when inflation was at its peak- now imagine every item in the grocery store that has a subsidy involved suddenly having that subsidy removed and increasing in price. On the flip side, everyone benefits from having less homeless people on the street, and society benefits from well paid teachers providing top notch education. People who receive government support are not always single issue voters- they have religion, identity, and other aspects to care about. They also are more likely to vote for preventative measures. If the economy in an area is depressed and everyone is on welfare because there is no work, these people are motivated to support politicians who will attempt to revive the local economy. On that note, removing the ability to vote from government workers or contractors is an excellent way to make sure the government is perpetually understaffed or unable to have contracts. Assuming you're from the US, you forget that workers pay towards their unemployment and social security. Every worker pays a tax on their income specifically for unemployment insurance and social security, meaning that this isn't everyone else paying but they themselves being obligated to pay an insurance. By this argument, someone making use of insurance should not vote.Lastly, no adult citizen should have the ability to vote removed from them. There is no such thing as an unbiased person, and the point of democracy is to ensure everyone has a voice. The ability to remove the right to vote from an adult citizen is an excellent opening for that ability to be abused by any politicians who want to modify the electorate to stay in power.","title":"CMV: people who are employed by the government or receive any form of government provided benefits should have their voting rights suspended until they are no longer in conflict of interest"},{"text":"It's going to be a special military operation, or some Trump version of that.\\n  \\nIt's not a war, you see, it's a military incursion to secure our border and to create a DMZ.

Many things are possible, but are not made in great numbers, for a whole host of reasons. (Take, for example, moon landers, or aircraft carriers, or nuclear-powered cars.) Furthermore, just because it is possible for something to be invented at one point in time, it does not logically follow that it will already exist at any previous point in time. When the movable type printing press was invented in the 1440s, this did not suddenly make it retroactively plausible that any previous books had already been made by printing press.

Similarly, while simulating universes is beyond our current reach, its not unreasonable to think it could become feasible in the future.My argument is this: if simulation theory can be actualized at any pointpast, present, or futurethen the likelihood we are currently living in a simulation increases significantly. The imagination of this possibility alone suggests it could already have been realized, perhaps by an advanced civilization or in a future timeline that encompasses us.What would change my view? Evidence that human thought consistently?*fails*?to lead to realizations over time, or proof that advanced civilizations (if they exist) could never create realistic simulations.

Really, its an assumption that you can decide for yourself it its fair 3. It is reasonable to assume simulations existHonestly I think this is fair, considering we have simulations, but strictly speaking there are legitimate arguments against this. The idea is that our simulations are much more simple than the world we live in, and they can contain large but simplified worlds with many people (or whatever is supposedly experiencing the simulation). Essentially the idea is to consider one of those NPCs. Theyre 100% definitely in a simulation, but they dont know it. They think theres no way Im in a simulation, look how complex the world is. Inside of this simulation, they have their own nations, states, cities, homes, and within those homes are computers with their own simulations, and those simulations have their own, getting increasingly simple as they go on. One day you decide to let this NPC in on a secret: you created this world they live in, and they are just one of billions of simulated people in a very simplified version of the real world.  He turns around and says out of the hundreds of worlds within my computer, none of them are aware of the level above them. What makes you think you are the one out of those hundreds which is at the very end of the chain? How would you ever know?Essentially, if a meaningful simulation exists you can calculate the odds that youre real with the formula:    (Real consciousness) / (Real consciousness + simulated consciousness)And its super easy to simulate consciousness, so the odds youre not simulated essentially go to 0. Its super easy to simulate people.One more analogy:Imagine youre a real world. By creating a simulation, youre creating a fake world, but you would never know if youre in the real one or the fake one. Both of these worlds can make simulations, and the ones they make can make more. How long until there is an ocean of fake worlds and just the one real?

For example, simulated physics could still allow for meaningful technological progress -- such as flying or simulation-building, since the rules of the simulation would enable it.If theres a mistake in my argument, it might be in assuming that patterns observed within our reality (e.g., thoughts leading to realizations) necessarily reflect a broader universal truth.

Because of shit like the system of Peonage that newly minted Mexican Americans had to face shortly after the Mexican-American war that trapped them into near literal debt slavery. Or the contemporary system for undocumented migrant workforce which uses coercion to depress their wages.Let's be really clear: the USA doesn't just have a history of chattel slavery; it *also* has a history of indentured servitude which extended to all races and its very important to remember this, because this country has never had an issue with expanding slavery; and arguably, that history of indentured servitude hasn't ended.We indeed, continue to use prison labor to this day, a human rights violation, and are only one of seventeen countries that use forced labor as lawful punishment for a crime; and I'll give you a hint: most of those seventeen are dictatorships.

And men were using that argument that \\"men will become worse to women because of this\\" even in the time of the suffragists (the nice ones). It's just not an argument that carries any weight before. Misandry js the answer to misogyny, not the other way around. And women are still not looking for revenge or we'd have more equality in the violent crime stats.\\nand if you claim to want to address misogyny, then addressing misandry will have to be a part of that.We disagree on that as the only viable solution.Misandry protects women and hurts men's feelings.

The benefits of legal immigration (eligibility for certain programs over time, pathways to citizenship, work eligibility, have and maintain rights, aren't open to the same level of exploitation and abuse, etc) are already there.Also- DREAMers didn't make any choice to immigrate. They were children and by definition did not have a say and may not even know or remember anything about their \\"home\\" country. You also can provide pathways while still 'penalizing' folks that need to take it if you for some reason believe they need more 'punishment' than what it means to live as an undocumented immigrant (though I think that's silly on its face as it would likely have a discouraging effect on some folks which reduces program efficacy AND ignores both the real exploitation those folks have faced, as well as their contributions without receiving any of the same access to programs/benefits/etc back other taxpayers receive) and/or further incentivize the legal process by reducing barriers/costs and upping the efficiency of the system as a whole. Our immigration system, including asylum, moves so incredibly slowly its absurd and only further incentivizes doing things the 'wrong' way. And its about to get actively worse.

I had to explain that to a friend of mine that Im realizing more by the day this year isnt nearly as smart as I once thought. He was talking about how we should put tariffs on China to encourage bringing those manufacturing jobs back to the US. I was like bro you realize theres 1.4 billion people in China? We simply dont even have enough unemployed people to take on our current manufacturing needs currently being met by China. Not to mention if you bring those cheap factory jobs back here youre also significantly raising the employment cost to produce those goods which will still increase inflation even though those jobs still wont be providing a living wage with American living costs.Now targeted tariffs on certain industries that can help bring back good jobs and not just cheap labor  do have some merit. But blanket tariffs are pure stupidity. Although id still argue a better method for doing that would be from direct investment and subsidies for those industries like the Biden administration successfully did to bring back chip manufacturing jobs but I cant even begin to explain things like that to these people.","title":"Mexican Presidents Harsh Takedown of Trump Exposes an Ugly MAGA Scam"},{"text":"I don't think he knows what a Marxist is, even.","title":"Trump Defense Secretary Pick Thinks Marxists Are Our Enemies"},{"text":"Youre right, theres minimal federal assistance available.

I sympathized, but there we are.They pass the tariffs on us, then blame the government, still bragging about earnings...then if we continue to pay the higher prices, they won't lower them even if Trump or the next President removes said tariffs.The bigger picture Americans need to really wake up to is China can boycott us easily, like they did soybeans, and then markets go down and jobs are lost. Tariffs on Mexico means we will pay more for produce, and American farmers won't stop growing tons of corn to use in biofuels and feed.

Most of their oil imports come from outside the North American oil market.  While we are net oil exporters, the net qualifier is important.  The U.S. exports more than it imports, but because of infrastructure limitations, Jones Act restrictions, and refiner arbitrage roughly 40% of oil used in the U.S. is imported even though we export slightly more than we import.  Of those imports, 70% come from Canada and Mexico. Mostly by pipeline with a smaller amount via rail or tanker trucks.  That oil is heavy and sour which makes it cheaper than what US shale oil can get on the global market (hence the arbitrage).  But because many of our refineries east of the Rockies use this oil it means those refineries are set up for processing heavy sour and **not** the domestically produced shale oil which is light and sweet.Thus if the price of Mexican and Canadian oil goes up, there is no way to quickly switch to domestic or other foreign suppliers.    Putting tariffs on Mexican and Canadian oil is one of the biggest possible economic self owns the U.S. could do.  I hope Trump does it.   The political damage, especially early in the administration, will be enormous.","title":"Exclusive: Trump plans no exemption for oil imports under new tariff plan, sources say"},{"text":"Dont you bring that juju over here..","title":"Ted Cruz: Republican Governors Need To Send All Illegal Aliens To Denver Mayors Home"},{"text":"Let me rephrase that.

Stuff like the ArriveCan criticisms are valid and have provided legit ammunition against the Liberals.Canada's version of the Big Free Money Experiment contributed to the same issues that have happened worldwide - inflation. - but for some reason Canada is the only country that refused to learn the lesson. Trudeau is giving out another $250 for shits and giggles in the spring, it's embarassing. Several provincial governments have done similar meme free money policies since CERB too. It's just irritating and stupid and I don't think it's even politically popular except for the first 5 minutes after it's announced.With that said, I agree broadly with your sentiment. My criticism of the Liberals basically boils down to \\"they're not conservative enough\\", which is probably not how most people feel, and also is in part the fault of the NDP coalition. All the criticisms of Trudeau's character are misguided and made in bad faith. I think he is genuinely a dedicated public servant, even if I don't like some of his policies I also think his achievements are being overlooked. Busting the cell phone cartel and bringing down cell plan prices has been a massive and tremendous success, for example. The carbon tax also is literally one of the best-structured taxes period, and for carbon pricing specifically it's one of if not THE best version of carbon pricing that the world has seen yet.

Its why the US changed its revenue and allowed taxation by the federal government in the first place. Then again, tariffs nowadays arent really used to generate revenue, only morons use them for that.What they are used for is to protect domestic industry, especially if another nation implements unfair economic practices. For example EV at the moment, where China is funneling endless money into its own manufacturers to give them an edge in global trade.What tariffs will not do, however (and this is a claimed goal by Trump), is to bring back manufacturing to the US. At least not the one that already moved away. Factories dont appear magically, neither does infrastructure and investment. Any corporation that goes to the US is in need on both and also to offset the tariffs implemented by other nations to offset Trumps tariffs. They would fare better being outside of the US, only paying one tariff - if exporting to the US. In this case, long term revenue will never be achieved. A good example for that are Trumps agricultural tariffs, which hurt farmers immensely because most of them are operating export businesses and got hit by retaliatory tariffs, therefore being incapable of exporting their goods. He had to rescue them with more money than tariffs gained.Additionally, since Trump wishes to lower taxes especially on the rich and corporations, what little he will generate in income through them will be dwarfed in comparison to what his other plans would cost. But then again, the dude wants to crash the US government, do that wont bother him in the slightest.","title":"Mexican Presidents Harsh Takedown of Trump Exposes an Ugly MAGA Scam"},{"text":"Kind of?

If you can't answer that question, congratulations, you're in good company. It's the multibillion-dollar enigma on the minds of some of the best-connected people in North America's capitals. Trump has threatened a 25 per cent tariff on every product entering from Canada and Mexico  unless those countries make as-yet-undefined changes at their borders to slow the flow of migrants and fentanyl. There's a widespread belief that Trump wants to extract concessions that will get his presidency off to a strong start. What's unclear: What numbers, or targets, or actions, would satisfy him and avoid a likely recession and trade war. Even people who know Trump, and trade, and Canada, confess to their own befuddlement, from people who worked in Trump's first White House to others advising the Canadian government. [...] The U.S. president-elect offered no specifics in his phone call Monday night with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Sources say the call began with a few minutes of friendly banter.  When they subsequently broached the potential irritant, Trump repeated the threat he'd posted on social media; Trudeau listed things Canada has already done at the border and suggested Canada's situation wasn't as dire as Mexico's. Here's what is already abundantly clear: The old maxim that national security equals economic security has never been more true. The U.S. is threatening to squeeze wallets to bolster its own national security. **In order to remain inside the American trade tent, this means seriously addressing U.S. concerns about things like the border, defence spending and the security of supply chains, say a number of insiders.** Trump demonstrated this pattern in his first term by threatening Mexico with tariffs unless it controlled migration. A first-term Trump official even recently suggested Canada deserves economic punishment if it won't increase defence spending.  Now, border security again is at the heart of a Trump threat about trade. A senior trade official in the first Trump White House said this represents a sea change. \\"It used to be that trade was discussed in backrooms in Geneva. That's no longer in the case. Trade used to rest in its own lanes, but the lanes have become increasingly blurred over the past year eight to 10 years,\\" said Everett Eissenstat, who was deputy director of Trump's White House National Economic Council in his first term, and a trade specialist. [...] Trump truly believes in tariffs, and believes in using them to achieve objectives others might see as unrelated, Eissenstat said.# No 'urgency' in Ottawa The Biden administration, for its part, used the carrot, not stick, approach to make progress on some issues. It pressed behind the scenes for Canada to tighten travel rules for Mexico, lobbied successfully for more defence spending, and actually gave Canada money after Ottawa reversed its approach to critical minerals; Canada relented on a plan to let Chinese state-owned companies to buy minerals used in electronics and weapons. The U.S. is now spending its own tax dollars, through a special military fund, to help jumpstart several Canadian mineral projects. \\"We shouldn't have had to wait for U.S. [defence spending] to go ahead with those projects,\\" said Heather Exner-Pirot, an adviser on energy and security to the Business Council of Canada. \\"There's no sense of urgency [in Ottawa].\\" The business lobby group argues in a new report for ramping up Canada's military capacity and minerals production with greater urgency. Trump's re-election might be stoking that urgency. But there's a longer-term trend Canada is waking up to, says Miller, a Canadian in Washington who advises governments and businesses in both countries. It's the growing anxiety of the superpower next door. It's an anxiety driven, in part, by a sense of losing ground to a powerful new adversary, China, on economics and military might. But as demonstrated by comments from Trump and his allies, U.S. security concerns start closer to home, at land borders, where millions of people have crossed illegally, including hundreds on terrorist watchlists stopped while crossing. \\"Canada has to readjust its thinking to a world where the U.S. feels vulnerable. And where it doesn't always treat its allies with the collaborative spirit you wish they did,\\" said Miller.  So what's Trump ultimately going to do? Canada has plenty riding on the result. Various estimates say, if implemented fully, Trump's tariffs could strip several points off Canada's economy. They could see Canada's GDP contract 2.4 per cent, push companies to move production to the U.S., drive down the dollar, stoke inflation and require urgent cuts in interest rates, which will further worsen the dollar and inflation, according to Andreas Schotter, a professor at Ivey Business School at Western University in London, Ont. Eissenstat, the former Trump White House official, says this could go either way. \\"It would be prudent to assume the worst and prepare for the worst, but be ready to try to make a better outcome achievable,\\" he said.  \\"These threats are real. They're a manifestation of broader trade trends and they need to be taken seriously.\\" If anyone can negotiate an exemption, it's Canada, says Miller.  There's a deal to be made if Trump actually wants one, he says, because the problems with Canada's border are comparably minor, and hardly justify the cross-border economic damage of tariffs on Canada's oil, cars and food. \\"But we cannot assume we're going to get to a decent place,\\" Miller said. \\"There are some people who say, 'He's negotiating. It's all posturing.' But I for one don't take that view. I think he's somebody who is perfectly willing to carry through on this.\\"  And if Trump does carry through? There will be lawsuits by U.S. companies, a trade challenge by Canada and Mexico under the CUSMA and talk of retaliatory tariffs, risking additional economic harm. It's possible Trump could announce the tariffs on Day 1, Jan. 20, Miller says, then it might take a while to apply them at the border, and in the meantime there would be ongoing negotiations. The broader story, however, would be the end of an era that dates back to North American trade pacts and arguably even earlier, to the 1965 Canada-U.S. free-trade deal in cars.  \\"We're talking about remaking how we've run our economies and done trade for the last 30 years,\\" he said. \\"[If this happens] effectively USMCA, or CUSMA, is done.\\"Further readings:[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-trumps-tariff-threat-is-an-opportunity-wrapped-in-a-crisis/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-trumps-tariff-threat-is-an-opportunity-wrapped-in-a-crisis/)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-trudeau-premiers-to-meet-as-trump-vows-to-levy-25-per-cent-tariffs-on/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-trudeau-premiers-to-meet-as-trump-vows-to-levy-25-per-cent-tariffs-on/)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/opinion/article-the-precursor-to-four-more-years-of-trump-tariff-threats/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/opinion/article-the-precursor-to-four-more-years-of-trump-tariff-threats/)[https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canadian-impacts-trump-tariff-proposal-1.7393493](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canadian-impacts-trump-tariff-proposal-1.7393493)[https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/reality-check-is-donald-trump-right-about-drugs-and-migrants-coming-across-the-canada-u/article_c1e11346-ac29-11ef-ade6-378c3a72786d.html](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/reality-check-is-donald-trump-right-about-drugs-and-migrants-coming-across-the-canada-u/article_c1e11346-ac29-11ef-ade6-378c3a72786d.html)[https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/trudeau-to-meet-with-premiers-today-following-trump-tariff-threat/article_3062da01-aaf9-509e-af66-904204ab2cba.html](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/trudeau-to-meet-with-premiers-today-following-trump-tariff-threat/article_3062da01-aaf9-509e-af66-904204ab2cba.html)Other news:[https://www.hilltimes.com/story/2024/11/27/liberals-new-tone-on-immigration-proves-bloc-was-right-says-critic-as-ndp-calls-it-a-flimsy-attempt-to-cover-their-political-behinds/442883/](https://www.hilltimes.com/story/2024/11/27/liberals-new-tone-on-immigration-proves-bloc-was-right-says-critic-as-ndp-calls-it-a-flimsy-attempt-to-cover-their-political-behinds/442883/)[https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/ndp-wont-support-250-cheques-for-canadians-unless-eligibility-expanded/article_ef821e04-ac46-11ef-b003-efd55a6876d7.html](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/ndp-wont-support-250-cheques-for-canadians-unless-eligibility-expanded/article_ef821e04-ac46-11ef-b003-efd55a6876d7.html)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-gst-holiday-and-250-cheques-a-missed-opportunity-to-truly-help/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-gst-holiday-and-250-cheques-a-missed-opportunity-to-truly-help/)[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-good-news-canada-the-economy-is-great-its-just-your-vibes-that-are-bad/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-good-news-canada-the-economy-is-great-its-just-your-vibes-that-are-bad/)[https://www.thestar.com/politics/provincial/ford-government-looking-to-build-three-new-power-plants-to-meet-electricity-demands-heres-where/article_f81a9372-acad-11ef-a71a-277e60f28c2d.html](https://www.thestar.com/politics/provincial/ford-government-looking-to-build-three-new-power-plants-to-meet-electricity-demands-heres-where/article_f81a9372-acad-11ef-a71a-277e60f28c2d.html)!ping Can","title":"What's Trump's price for averting tariffs?

Especially in the case of the trade dynamics with Mexico and USA. USA is a net importer, and Mexico is our biggest trading partner. Mexico placing tariffs on American companies makes it harder for these companies to trade in Mexico, yes, but how many of these businesses are ?competitive in Mexico in the first place considering the big reason why America is trying to employ tariffs is to make their own industry more competitive? This dynamic doesnt seem like it should change with American goods in Mexico, unless the companies were subsidizing Mexican buyers by profits off American consumers (since they can *possibly* charge higher prices from the tariffs in America).?Given this, isnt this just more-so just actively self-harming yourself in the hopes that your opponent (who is also self-harming themself) stops??","title":"Mexico suggests it would impose its own tariffs to retaliate against any Trump tariffs"},{"text":"This is how cults behave.

Its easy for me as a relatively young person to forget just how new the internet/social media is, and how wildly unprepared we are as a species to filter information coming from millions of people we dont know. Not to mention the influence of social media algorithms and the manipulations of those who own the platforms.Even as someone whose career is in communications and media, I find that I can be too easily influenced by the media I consume. Im inclined to trust the people I choose to follow, and I honestly dont think thats an entirely bad thing. But I do think its important to pay attention to the credibility of those you choose to trust on the internet, and to cross-reference what they say. Its just difficult to always double check everything, given the volume of information we are able to consume on a daily basis. All that to say, I agree with you.

The position of a lot of the Marxists through Zero Books (largest marxist publisher in the US) and the American Communist Party is that a Trump win is better for the actual left in the long term since Liberals tend to undermine the left by occupying and watering down/delaying leftist reforms far more than the right who are easier to fight head on.A lot of Marxists are also largely ambivalent about Trump as they align more with his positions of tearing down Neoliberalism, far less Hawkish positions than the Democrats, more state intervention in the economy and see both sides as grifting capitalists anyway, another thing is that Democrats in power tends to make Liberals far more pro-Establishment and rabidly inline with the worst excesses of US Governance and Capitalist exploitation, where at least Liberals oppose awful things when Republicans are in power.","title":"Trump Defense Secretary Pick Thinks Marxists Are Our Enemies"},{"text":"The hes trying to get a better deal denial kills me cause he tried that last time with the tariffs on Canada and it resulted in a better deal for Canada.So i guess theyre not wrong, its just gonna be better for Canada and Mexico lmao.","title":"Mexican Presidents Harsh Takedown of Trump Exposes an Ugly MAGA Scam"},{"text":"Biden was cooked.

In the 6 states that flipped from Biden to Trump, she maintained more votes than Trump got in 2020 in 5 of them, and gained votes over Biden in 3. She maintained support where she needed it, but maintaining wasn't enough to win. The popular vote is a bit of a distraction in this case. She lost 4m votes in just 4 states - CA, NY, TX, and FL, none of which were close to flipping. To me it points to issues out of Harris's hands - being tagged in so last minute means she was hyperfocused on those margins. I think if Biden had been able to maintain a baseline level of performance and stay in the race, he would have lost by the same margins in the swing states and had much better numbers nationally. It's a pretty unprecedented situation for the VP to take over the campaign this late in the game so I don't think anyone knew to expect her support to be so soft in the highly partisan races, they were just focused on the swing states and expected their shifts to represent the country as a whole. On 2) this is an entirely logical but usually untrue line of thinking - if the polls just consistently underestimate one candidate by 2 points, 4 points, whatecee, that means that one candidate wins all the questionable states no problem, and these 5 \\"safe states\\" are all in play, making a landslide victory possible. Sometimes you can point to a senate race polling very far off the presidential race in one state as evidence that something weird is going on. Trump won all 6 swing states that were all within margin of error, basically 50-50. This is a weak indicator that their might have been a small systemic polling error. If they were all 50-50, 3-3, 4-2, and 5-1 splits are all more likely. Given that pollsters are all trying to avoid systemic polling error, you never know which way it's going to cut.","title":"Harris aides say internal polling never had her ahead of Trump"},{"text":"Just goes to show you have zero clue of what you are talking about.
