First off it notes that he has no ability to do a lot of what he is supposedly doing with executive orders and hirings. Essentially he is trying to make parts of federal and state and foreign governments do what he wants through executive orders even though they have no connection to those orders or ability to follow those orders. In reality, most of Trumps orders may have little practical effect.Half the article is dedicated to \\"ludicrous\\" orders that will have zero affect on anything. They explain that Trump can't, literally has no one he can order, to ignore or counter certain laws or directives from the court or congress. The first half of the article outlines how counter productive, not productive, or destructive most of this all will be. Trump is a fool surounded by fools. He is a man who keeps doing things that get him impeached and convicted of things like rape, tax fraud, charity fraud, civil rights violations etc. The reason he is back where he is is because he has no shame. But again...he was impeached twice. Vance is going to 25th him sometime between now and 2027. 100% no doubt. I knew he was going to get impeached because he is a fool, all you had to do was live in NY in the 80s/90s and you would know based on Trump's history during those decades. The man is a fool and a pompous criminal hack. That is how I was certain he would get impeached. I didn't realize that the senate wouldn't remove him from office. And I am certain Vance is going to 25th him at the earlierst possible time. Once removed from office that is it, Trump is done. He will slink off to selling gold toilets or something to whiskey tango fools.","title":"Trumps first executive orders preview his second administrations chaos and cruelty"},{"text":"It's still Gulf of Mexico on Wikipedia and even if Americans change it, nobody else is going to change  it","title":"Trump's promise to end the Ukraine war in a day meets harsh realities"},{"text":"https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/International/US-Based-Semiconductor-Company-Tied-to-Russian-Military-Supply-Chain.html#:~:text=In%202015%2C%20Yangjie%20closed%20on%20a%20deal,which%20can%20be%20used%20in%20military%20technology.https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/11/10-iconic-american-companies-owned-by-chinese-investors.htmlhttps://www.marketplace.org/2021/05/06/u-s-ramps-up-scrutiny-chinese-companies-buying-american-tech-firms/About a 1 minute google search shows its been going on for a while.","title":"Donald Trump says TikTok \\"worthless,\\" might not save it after all"},{"text":"It would only get me and my xanax into serious problems.

Most far-right European and American movements are anti-immigration, anti-globalism, and therefore anti-EU, NATO, etc. Weakening any of these multi-country pacts weakens opposition to Russia. So does electing politicians who favor an isolationist policy, like the tariff-heavy \\"America first\\" approach that Trump campaigned on. That leads Russia to support these right wing movements, which in turn generates support for Russia within these movements. It also helps that Russia projects an image that is conservative, anti-gay, white, religious, and macho/masculine, which aligns well with the social ideology of most of these movements. So it's half ideological alignment, half convenient alliance against the current political views that dominate Western govenrments.","title":"cmv: I genuinely think that placing someone so erratic, loud-mouthed, and wildly unpredictable in a position of power could actually benefit world peace."},{"text":"All the red states are gonna miss the federal dollars since all their farm workers wont be counted.","title":"Trump rescinds Biden's census order, clearing a path for reshaping election maps"},{"text":"Bigger population, bigger country, more resources, nuclear weapons.","title":"cmv: I genuinely think that placing someone so erratic, loud-mouthed, and wildly unpredictable in a position of power could actually benefit world peace."},{"text":"As a programmer: Musk doesnt know how to write or interpret code.

If Trump attacks our economy, Canadian tariffs will be placed on $105 billion of U.S. goods. The on-line chatter is that we will demand to know if goods are made in the U.S., and will will either boycott them or demand that they be priced out of the market counter-tariffs. Canada has been a good and honest trading partner and has done nothing to deserve this. We say bring it on.","title":"Get your maple syrup and Mexican Coca Cola in ASAP."},{"text":"I used to be a big fan of Musk, but I now think he is a bit immature and a bit of what you may call an \\"edgelord\\" or \\"troll.\\" Imagine a redditor but if they were a billionaire with a lot of real world influence, he is like that.

They'd probably think Edward Norton was the good guy, but they're being suckered in the same way as Edward Furlong. Are we in hell?Anyway I'm not calling for people to be SHARPs. I wouldn't advocate for violence, and you know, any excuse for them to further their stupid \\"vIoLEnt LeFT\\" rhetoric and justify violence against us. I hate this.

And Trumps first-day batch is sure to invite litigation where they attempt to run roughshod over enacted regulation, law, treaty, or constitutional amendment. However, Trump begins his term with the backing of an arch-conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court, which has shown little appetite to overrule him and no interest in holding him accountable.Trump started signing orders soon after he was sworn in as president, signed some more at a lunch with lawmakers, and then sat at a miniature desk onstage at the Capital One arena, where his indoor parade was held, took out a Sharpie, and signed even more of them as his supporters cheered. He then headed to the Oval Office to sign some more.

Trump literally can't end birthright citizenship, he doesn't have the mechanisms or access to the mechanisms to do so. Thing is I don't really care about birthright by location citizenship.

That is it. But to change that we need a constitutional amendment, changes to laws and interpretations of laws. That requires the efforts of state governments, congress, and the supreme court. Only then does the executive get involved, partially, in enforcing these laws, partially.

He said his advisers had told him not to talk in his first address about the pardons?Joe Biden?had issued or the Jan. 6, 2021, rioters.If the defining clash of the first Trump administration was between establishment figures and MAGA loyalists, the dueling speeches offered a glimpse at the central push-and-pull of his second: The new presidents desire to score policy victories that offer the tantalizing possibility of a Ronald Reagan-esque legacy, versus his thirst for retribution and vindication.That tension could also be seen in the raft of executive orders he unveiled Monday, which showed him not just resurrecting his America First agenda, but distilling it into its purest form.[You can read the latest Big Take here.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-01-21/who-s-influencing-trump-dueling-visions-key-players-to-shape-his-new-term)","title":"Who's Influencing Trump?

By your definition of the gesture it is impossible to differentiate between a genuine salute and a handwave, which shows that a) it's a crappy definition and b) it contradicts reality, as people don't have a habit of accidentally making Nazi salute when they wave at each other.","title":"CMV: Elon Musk is not a Nazi"},{"text":"God we are so screwed","title":"Trump Withdraws U.S. from World Health Organization"},{"text":"https://preview.redd.it/2bhax8x1bdee1.jpeg?width=479&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9353a4e399186841aff7493bc8ec42da4e383b7","title":"Trump withdraws the U.S. from the World Health Organization"},{"text":"The splitting up of children from their parents is a huge legal system problem/burden.

There is a chance SCOTUS may rule on it to make it more specific, but traditionally conservative judges have a much more literal interpretation of law.

Each group only has the power it has because it has worked, however remotely, in concert with the others. As soon as you start pruning issue groups, you are literally pruning your manpower for the remaining groups.We differ on initial perspectives. I acknowledge the dem party is built on a coalition like you however I think it is time to overhaul that specific aspect of the party. No coalitions, no factions. There is a party agenda and the machine supports those running the agenda. This explains why we lost the Muslims, Hispanic and Black voters and why they resonated with the Trump platform. They didnt say youre Latinx so this what well do for you I believe this was a rejection of that factionalized mentality. But all that was just one thing you were wrong about. The other thing youre wrong about is more implicit: that you only need a political party with the right attitude. Our strategy must be bigger than that. We are going to need to conduct no less than medium-scale economic warfare. We need to organize general strikes and tax strikes. (Yes, I am saying that we need to get a critical mass of people to risk the wrath of the IRS. I know how nuts that sounds, but were up against literal Nazis, so settle down please.) It may be necessary to organize covert societies, just like the days of liberal organizing under the heel of Metternich in 1848 or the Romanovs in the late 1800s. If Trump really invades Canada or Panama or another ally, we may need to be willing to attempt to physically stop military vehicles, knowing the risk to ourselves (but with the organization to have our comrades nearby, capturing the video in order to spread it widely).I just dont see how convincing and mobilizing voters en masse to carry out general strikes and tax strikes is feasible compared to actual policy at the local level that wins hearts and minds.","title":"Dems need a strategy overhaul + sanity check?"},{"text":"CliMaTe ChAnGe DoEsNt ExIsT they say as they put on snow gear to go outside in fucking Louisiana.Our Climate is fine!","title":"Trumps Day One Executive Orders Will Worsen Climate Crisis"},{"text":"Yesterday was great.

Bradwell, who graduated law school with honors and had passed the bar, challenged the Supreme Court of Illinois decision prohibiting her from practicing law in the state.The Illinois Supreme Court had found Bradwell legally disabled: As a married woman she had no separate legal existence apart from her husbands. She could neither own property nor enter into legal agreements.The case went to the United States Supreme Court with Myra Bradwell arguing that Illinois violated the Fourteenth Amendments equal protection provision. The Supreme Court saw otherwise, ruling that the amendment did not require states to open the legal profession to women. One justice wrote: The paramount destiny and mission of women are to fulfill the noble and benign offices of wife and mother.Multiple attempts have been made to change the us constitution.change wording to add women, to clarify that people means men and women not just man.the failed era.none of this is new, womens rights, and most rights, are based on branches of government that can just as quickly revoke them.Therefore it theoretically can be argued that no female (new rules, only male and female exists according to federal gov) has citizenship. She is property of her father, then husband, otherwise a citizenshipless ward of the government.As it was originally interpreted to mean.The exception is if a female has gained citizenship after her birth.Also any child born must be accepted by the father, and that father have citizenship, to be eligible for citizenship.  But only for male children of course. (Females cant automatically be citizens so no child born can be a citizen via mother unless she had gained citizenship herself after birth.)Women can vote, but only citizens.  How many women can vote now?  The birthright order appears to come into effect in 30? Days, not retroactive.But any SC ruling can change all that.So theoretically only males who can prove ongoing generational citizenship via paternal linkage has citizenship or voting rights (or rights to education, housing, healthcare, etc).and females that have gained citizenship since birth.Lots of males may also not be considered a citizen too, by this theory.  What if they dont have a American father, or that male himself was born of an immigrant fatherWorst case, almost no citizens lol.","title":"Presidents Cant End Birthright Citizenship | President Trumps executive order is almost certain to be struck down."},{"text":"Well he might need bigger hands then.","title":"Donald Trump says TikTok \\"worthless,\\" might not save it after all"},{"text":"Whats the saying that a republican will shit his pants if he knows a liberal will smell it.","title":"Dear Trump Voters ... this was only Day 1 ..."},{"text":"Damn, is that the best these people can come up with?

Elon even went on a tour of Israel last year to try and clear his name. He has also recently been promoting the neo Nazi far right German party the AfD. So I see all that, and then see his gesture yesterday and if it walks and talks like a Nazi, then isn't it a nazi?","title":"CMV: Elon Musk is not a Nazi"},{"text":"I saw the same thing in r/Kansas this morning so I posted this:https://preview.redd.it/zfpug30r8dee1.jpeg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da4665fb632055e7bfc79080f1c94c6fe109f5ee","title":"So many Trump haters posting here since the Inauguration."},{"text":"Pay attention!!

The process is though that someone who's affected by the EO needs to take the case to the supreme court. Since the EO specifies that it applies to babies born 30 days from now, that means that while civil rights organizations are probably looking for immigrants who are expecting to be a part of the court case, they can't file until 30 days and the babies are born. And then they have to take the case through the lower courts first. So this whole process might take quite a bit of time to resolve. But, assuming the supreme court hasn't jumped completely off the deep end, it'll eventually get resolved and all the babies born here will get retroactive citizenship, hopefully before they run into any problems of not having citizenship.","title":"Trump signs executive order ending birthright citizenship"},{"text":"\\"Camp Auschwitz\\" shirt guy was also pardoned.","title":"Trump pardons roughly 1,500 criminal defendants charged in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack"},{"text":"We are currently in a \\"dems in disarray\\" moment.

At his inauguration yesterday, Trump seated the tech bosses, his nerd broligarchy, in front of his supposed cabinet. Needless to say, it was all a hopelessly overstimulating day for Elon Musk, whose double salute on stage later was a pure Dr Strangelove spasm, generously described by the Anti-Defamation league as an awkward gesture. Listen, if your friends wont tell you, then who will?...The day marked a personal tipping point for Trump, who has now pulled out of more international agreements than Playmates. Among his withdrawals on Monday were the Paris climate agreement, and the World Health Organization, a body that seems to have been about as prepared for this news as it was for the Covid pandemic. Over in the Oval Office, meanwhile, the Diet Coke button has been restored C the least imaginative red button ever to grace a strongmans desk C along with busts and paintings of admired politicians who are too dead to be able to tell Trump precisely how much theyd have hated him....Other genre-clashing vignettes from the day are too numerous to detail, although special mention might be made of the spectacle of YouTuber brothers Jake and Logan Paul laughing it up with mad-eyed OpenAI boss Sam Altman. We keep hearing that AI can take over all the time-sucking and unpleasant tasks in life, and yet there is not even the slimmest suggestion it can endure this presidency on our behalf. Thus far, the sole thing technology advances have assisted with is making it easier is for those of us screenshotting peoples foolhardy appreciations of Trumps way of doing business, to remind them of when it all goes tits up.One thing I can already live without is a rapidly decomposing banquet of the worlds politicians droning on about reality and declaring reedily that they are ready to work with Trump. The intimation that this is the only grownup position doesnt really account for what many people believe is the most salient fact: that Trump is not a brash but necessary guy, but a serious pox on humanity. Maybe we should substitute the word Trump for a harmful affliction, and see if that feels clarifying in terms of the futility of appeasing him. I dont agree with everything smallpox does, but I am willing to work with it. Actually, having typed that I realise that working with smallpox might genuinely be one of health secretary Robert F Kennedys policies. His lawyer has certainly already asked the Food and Drug Administration to revoke approval of the polio vaccine. But remember, if you dont act like these are people to do business with, you arent a serious person.Having passed on the opportunity to watch the inauguration day shenanigans, it's looking like the concerns that folks had about the second term of this president were entirely valid. The coming years will be more challenging than they needed to be, and will be a test to see how the vaunted system of checks and balances actually works when the system as a whole moves to break itself.","title":"So this is Trumps golden age C chaos, dysfunction and a coalition of creeps | Confusing and capricious, he started as he means to go on.

Its just pure arithmetic: Canadian exports into the US accounts for 23% of Canadas GDP and nearly 5 million jobs.

A 25% counter tariff will see US output decline by .4%, which means the US economy would still probably grow even though unemployment would grow to about 4.5% (again, conservative estimates).Of course, its all more complicated than that. Supply chains in both countries are deeply intertwined but its just a matter of arithmetic that a 25% tariff on Canada will be apocalyptic whereas a 25% tariff on the US will be a minor annoyance.

Theyre often called safety nets for a reason.  Im a Massachusetts liberal, I have a great career, and I have great private insurance.

However, given her condition at birth, she automatically qualified for MassHealth (Medicaid) as secondary insurance.  I ended up not having to pay a cent beyond my co-pays.These programs help many people - just because they help one group the most doesnt mean everyone doesnt benefit.

Schedule F uses a particular line of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, 5 USC 7511(b)(2), that exempts from certain civil service protections federal employees whose positions have been determined to of a confidential, policy-determining, policy making, or policy advocating position. This classification would remove these employees from collective bargaining and due process protections, but they cannot be technically dismissed for partisan affiliation, or other federally protected reasons (discrimination, retaliation, etc.). Two agencies were the only ones to complete the initial classification decisions before it was rescinded, OPM (415/610 of its employees would be reclassified) and the International Boundary and Water Commission (5/234 being reclassified). A few agencies have prepared prospective lists pending review: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, EEOC, EPA, and FTC (all with only about 10% of their people being reclassified). Several agencies have said that no one would be reclassified: Federal Maritime Commission, Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, National Archives and Records Administration, NTSB, NLRB, and the AmeriCorps. However, the Biden administration put into the Code of Federal Regulations a regulation that allows employees who are reclassified to keep existing protections. While the Trump administration can rescind this regulation, itll take a few months to do so as federal rules take time to undo.","title":"Federal Worker Union Sues Trump Over Ending Job Protections"},{"text":"Did he pardon the people convicted of assaulting the police?","title":"Police Officers Who Defended Capitol From Trump's Mob Blast His Mass Pardon Of Rioters: One former officer called Trump's blanket pardon \\"a miserable miscarriage of justice.\\""},{"text":"All without them admitting guilt.","title":"Trump delivered his J6 pardons, now Congress must decide fate of panel that required clemency | Just The News"},{"text":"Would love to know how much an EO costs.

And there is still much to do.\\nIn fact, many Christians on a daily basis petition God and each other to forgive them for: What I (we) have done and what I have failed to do.I also believe this is not a uniquely Christian thing. Christian identity has a lot of parallels and equivalents in American modern culture insomuch that it views itself as a universal paradigm to address world (global) issues.  Just like American politics (and perhaps vice versa), Christian leadership has attracted some unsavory fellows and people prone to deviance (to put it lightly). Where Christians go wrong is when they idolize their identity. The fact of the matter is: humans are humans; the same types that would falsely assert themselves to be a prophet are now also explicitly represented at our highest levels of government - Charlatans are a dime a dozen. Within the Christian tradition, even Jesus warns against this as he sees people are vulnerable to this in every organization and tribe, even religious ones like the Church he was founding. Christianity intimates that (human) suffering is precipitated by Individuals choosing comfort over what we know to be right: helping alleviate affliction.

If they're not eligible, the child would be stateless. Some countries without birthright citizenship still give citizenship to a child born in their territory if they'd otherwise be stateless, so the US might implement this clause.This all assumes it's smooth sailing and is able to be implemented, but it's unlikely to become reality since the government going to be sued and probably going to lose.","title":"Trump signs executive order ending birthright citizenship"},{"text":"\\"Impeach this democratic elected official\\"","title":"Lets be nicer about Trump not putting his hand on the Bible, we all know he would burn if he did that"},{"text":"My friend works in the federal government as a 1 day a week in office worker who claims he wrote in batman, however we think he voted for trump","title":"Federal Worker Union Sues Trump Over Ending Job Protections"},{"text":"Not Fed unions, no.

Mar 18, 20226 min read\\nHow Government Propaganda Was Legalized: The Smith-Mundt Modernization ActOriginally Published July 26, 2017 4:50 pm by Investment Watch by Pamela WilliamsH.R. 4310 passed into law when it was signed by the President Obama on Jan 2, 2013.  There is an ongoing controversy surrounding the Bill. I want to start this report with a video: Congressman Dennis Kucinich opposes H.R. 4310 C National Defense Authorization Act for 2013.However, Kucinich does not oppose it for the reason that most people are against it.  Many people feel it legalized the use of propaganda on American audiences.  It is being said it allowed the material produced by the State Department and the Pentagon to strike the ban that had been in place on domestic dissemination of propaganda.In laymans terms the news media/government can broadcast propaganda to the American people as they please.  However, I will leave it to the reader to make the judgment him/her self.  However, it has been signed into place, and there is nothing that can be done about it at this time.  RELATED: Truth Proof ?? The CIA is Responsible for Fake News - Operation Mockingbird:  The greatest worry is that the the Bill essentially neutralized two previous actsthe Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 and Foreign Relations Authorization Act in 1987that had been passed to protect U.S. audiences from their  own governments misinformation campaigns.I, myself, do not trust the government period, so this does not affect my beliefs to any great degree.  I take most of what they say as propaganda.Here is the simplified description of the amendment:Amendment No. 114Reps. Thornberry (R-TX) and Smith (D-WA):The amendment would amend the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (known as the Smith-Mundt Act) and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1986 and 1987 to clarify the authorities of the Department of State and the Broadcasting Board of Governors to prepare, disseminate and use public diplomacy information abroad and to strike the current ban on domestic dissemination of such material. The amendment would clarify that the Smith-Mundt Acts provisions related to public diplomacy information do not apply to other federal departments or agencies (including the DoD).What most people refer to as propaganda material, the amendment refers to as public diplomacy information. The text of the amendment to Bill H.R. 4310 was a difficult to track down, but here it is  with the  change that concerns so many:AMENDMENT NO. 114 OFFERED BY MR.

You'd be surprised at the diversity of interpretations of gender. Please do not dismiss a complex idea based on what you think is common sense - you are making a gigantic assumption, here. People online betray their idea of reasoning to be like this all the time and it astounds me. As problematic as humanity is, how we perceive the world is relatively complex in any time and place. I have several degrees from good schools dealing with human culture and ancient history. Different accounts of gender have been recorded and studied for at least a 100 years in my field. When it makes it to the wider public, they tend to think of it as a new, unestablished idea and dismiss it. I implore you to read some academic books or at least a good academic intro to anthropology. Find the course outline for a class in intro to social or cultural anthropology from a good school, look at their reading list for their intro to anthropology text or their articles they list about the topic of sex and gender. Generally, yes, there are two adult genders, but the concepts behind them and what is between or before those are not as simple, anywhere.(And before you get told some crap by a know-it-all here who is not involved in scholarship:  no, anthropology is not a perfect field, its origins are problematic, and it is an interpretative science. But no science or social science is perfect and you do not dismiss all scholarship if one person makes a mistake or is discredited. Science and social sciences develop through trial and error, facts, interpretation, and peer review and argumentation. And they're as good as their scholars are reflective and critical of how their own biases that affect interpretation. There is no magic black and white answer to anything except basic math.)Humanistic studies, like gender-based studies, also discuss this topic of course. Other social science fields also address the topic of sex and gender but anthro is the one that looks at it through culture and time. If I trusted every certified teacher to teach with a critical lens of their own biases, I would push for a basic, mandatory anthro class in high school that teaches about the fluidity of ideas over time, genetics, how biases affect our interpretation of the world, and the origins of the concepts behind biases. Maybe then we could shake off the hegemony of both race-based doctrine and frozen Judeo-Christian partriarchal-serving concepts of gender. Colonization made these ideas more widespread, so we lost a lot of the diversity there once was in ideas.","title":"TRUMP: It will be the officially policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female."},{"text":"It's this 1000% it's why when you try to argue with something they say, many of them will resort to just shouting \\"free speech\\".Like I didn't fucking say it was illegal to say it, I said you were wrong and shitty.","title":"HAPPENING NOW: Instagram is now blocking pro-Democrat, anti-Republican hashtags.

Those creators wouldn't have new content ready for after the ban, so there'd be a window still of no real new content so people will see some strange videos, and a lot more videos from non-americans.

By that time, Planned Parenthood has pulled up stakes. They would have to start from scratch if they want to reestablish service after everything is said and done. The same could apply to all trumps crazy EOs. They don't have to ultimately stand. They just need to stand long enough for shit to happen.

Sanders has been weak on Palestine, &amp; weak against the right wing shifts the Dems have done, &amp; his already loose status as a democratic socialist has been demoted to center left as a result. In response to that though, I think hes starting to drop his pointless defense of the indefensible Democrats.He should leave and join the DSA or PSL and uplift them, while directing people to vote third party. Trying to be left in the Dems is like trying to be left in the GOP at this point. Its a waste of money to spend thousands/millions to primary a right wing dem when you can just run third party in the general &amp; spare yourself the wasted expenses. That Sanders doesnt do that is part of the reason hes not liked by the left very much, &amp; why a lot of the zoomer progressives radicalized by him in 2016/2020 are now further left than him.The idea of a left-Dem coalition is a myth and Jamal Bowman being destroyed by AIPAC **with support from Establishment Democrats** is proof of that bc Bowman wasnt even left wing. There is no place for the left. Better off running third party and using that opportunity to draw the connection between GOP donors/lobbyists and Dem donors/lobbyists and how thats directly tied to nothing ever *significantly changing* when the party in power is switched.**There is no left wing future with the democrats.

The Chinese side proposes a joint venture agreement with the foreign company where the\\nforeign side will own some percentage of the to-be-formed entity.\\n4.

Then, about 12 hours later,?[Trump issued sweeping pardons](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/01/21/nation/trump-pardons-jan-6-defendants/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)?of about 1,500 people convicted of crimes that day as they sought to overturn his 2020 election loss.I was going to talk about the J6 hostages, Trump told an overflow crowd in the Capitols Emancipation Hall early Monday afternoon,?noting issues he decided to leave out of his inaugural speech. But youll be happy because its action not words that count, and youre going to see a lot of action on the J6 hostages.Those comments drew applause from the approximately 1,500 governors and other VIPs there,?who were not among the approximately 600 people who attended the ceremony in the Capitol rotunda two floors above.Trumps political career seemed finished after the Jan. 6 attack, in which he did nothing for three hours as the police fought the rioters. But he staged a remarkable comeback and won a narrow victory in November that he said in his inaugural address had provided a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal.Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and indeed to take my life just a few months ago in a beautiful Pennsylvania field \\\\[when\\\\] an assassins bullet ripped through my ear, but I felt then and believe even more so now that my life was saved for a reason, I was saved by God to make America Great Again, he said to loud applause.Trump became only the second president to be defeated for reelection and then win another term. He also made history as the first convicted felon to be elected president. And although Biden, 82, was the oldest president ever, Trump, 78, on Monday became the oldest person to be inaugurated.The audience in the crowded rotunda included former presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, as well as Biden and the candidate Trump defeated in November, Vice President Kamala Harris. Bitter over his 2020 loss, Trump did not welcome Biden to the White House four years ago and broke with decades of tradition by skipping his successors inauguration. But Biden performed those duties on Monday before departing by helicopter from the Capitol after Trumps speech.Most inaugurations since the early 1800s have been held outdoors in front of the Capitol. But with forecasts of bitter cold and wind on Monday, Trump opted to move his second inauguration indoors, meaning hundreds of thousands of people would not be able watch in person. The traditional inaugural parade from the Capitol to the White House also was canceled, replaced with an indoor rally at the Capitol One Arena in downtown Washington.The switch led to an unusual quiet throughout Washington for Inauguration Day.It was hard to tell our constituents who had paid so much to come up here they werent going to get anything ... but everybody was very gracious and kind of felt the most important thing was he was sworn in, said[?Laura Strong, the wife of Representative Dale Strong, an Alabama Republican, as she waited in her red Alabama for Trump hat and sequined Trump Strong jacket to watch the ceremony from the overflow room in Emancipation Hall](https://x.com/JimPuzzanghera/status/1881368927105888441).","title":"Washington tried to hold a normal inauguration.

(When asked by a reporter in the room why he changed his mind about the app, Trump said it was because he got to use it and said that the U.S. has \\"bigger\\" concerns.)During his Oval Office spray, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to postpone the ban on TikTok as he tries to find a way to keep the app active in the U.S. -- instructing the attorney general to delay the ban by 75 days.The newly inaugurated president also shrugged off national security concerns about the social media app when pressed by reporters in the Oval Office on Monday evening.\\"TikTok is worthless, worthless if I don't approve it, it has to close. I learned that from the people that own it. If I don't do the deal, it's worthless, worth nothing. If I do the deal, it's worth maybe a trillion dollars, a trillion,\\" Trump said.He continued to argue that there should be at least 50% U.S. ownership of the app, although he didn't make mention of the national security that prompted the app's ban in the first place. Trump notably called for a ban of the app due to national security during his first term.\\"If I do the deal for the United States, then I think we should get half. In other words wait, I think the US should be entitled to get half of TikTok. And congratulations, TikTok has a good partner, and that would be worth, you know, could be $500 billion or something,\\" Trump said.Trump also continued to float the idea of a \\"joint venture,\\" but didn't specify exactly what that means.When asked whether the CEO of TikTok is open to that idea, Trump said that he is \\"around.\\"Trump also wrote off the concerns over the app sharing data with the Chinese government. \\"But remember, they make telephones in China. They make all sorts of things in China. Nobody ever complains about that. Here they're complaining about this, so many different products made in China, nobody ever complained about the only one they complain about is TikTok,\\" Trump said.When asked by a reporter in the room why he changed his mind about the app, Trump said it was because he got to use it and said that the U.S. has \\"bigger\\" concerns.\\"Because I got to use it. And remember, TikTok is largely about kids, young kids.

The US president made the move in an executive order on Monday night, withdrawing US support for a global tax pact agreed at the OECD last year that allows other countries to levy top-up taxes on US multinationals. He added that the list of options for protective measures should be drawn up within 60 days, putting signatories to the OECD pact  including EU member states, the UK, South Korea, Japan and Canada  on notice that Washington intends far-reaching challenges to global tax rules. Trump clashed with European leaders during his first term as president over proposed digital taxes that would affect big US tech groups such as Googles owner Alphabet and Apple, threatening France at one point with tariffs.\\nHis order on Monday includes investigating whether any foreign countries are not in compliance with any tax treaty with the US or have any tax rules in place, or are likely to put tax rules in place, that are extraterritorial or disproportionately affect American companies. Former UK trade department official Allie Renison, now at consultancy SEC Newgate, said the move showed Trump was widening the economic warfare net far beyond tariffs in response to what the US sees as discriminatory practices from other countries. Going after their domestic tax regimes off the back of hitherto global commitments shows Trump is getting creative in his fight to put America First, she said. The economic warfare net is ever-widening well beyond just tariffs, and as governments start to consider their response, concerns will now pivot to what else might be caught up in retaliatory crosshairs  and the inevitable costs that go with it. The global deal agreed at the Paris-based OECD in 2021 and partly introduced by several countries last year was expected to raise the tax take from the worlds biggest multinationals by up to $192bn a year. Under pillar two of the OECD deal if corporate profits were taxed below 15 per cent in the country where the multinational was headquartered, signatories could potentially charge top-up levies. But one part of the interlocking measures, known as the undertaxed profits rule (UTPR), has long drawn Republican anger, with the party labelling it discriminatory. Grant Wardell-Johnson, global head of tax policy at accountants KPMG, said US responses could include imposing additional taxes on foreign-owned businesses operating in the US, or withholding taxes on payments to those jurisdictions. Ultimately we are seeing international taxation moving from a multilateral domain to a bilateral one based on strong unilateral assertions. It is a new taxation world, he added. Alex Cobham, chief executive of the Tax Justice Network, an international campaign group, said Trumps move in effect left the OECD pact dead in the water. In the two-part memo to the US Treasury secretary, Trump first ordered that commitments made by the Biden administration to the OECD pact be rescinded  a move that had been widely anticipated  but then broadened the scope of the attack. Cobham said the potential scope spanned not just whether the OECD pact violated tax treaties, but at the extraterritorial potential of all tax rules in all countries. If you take this statement at face value, theres every chance they come back in 60 days and say most countries of the world and most OECD member countries should be subject to the counter measures theyre talking about, he said. One senior EU official said Trumps billionaire technology entrepreneurs were pushing him to act on tax rather than trade. The conversation on tariffs will be transactional but the real fight will move to where fortunes are at stake and big tech has an interest, they added. Mathias Cormann, OECD secretary-general, said: There have been concerns raised with us by US representatives about various aspects of our international tax agreement.\\nHe added the organisation would keep working with the US and all countries at the table to support international co-operation that promotes certainty, avoids double taxation, and protects tax bases. The European Commission said it took note of Trumps presidential memorandum. We from our side remain committed to our international obligations...and are open to a meaningful dialogue with our international partners, said a spokesperson.","title":"Donald Trump threatens tax war over US multinationals"},{"text":"Definitely the best presidential speech Ive heard in my lifetime, but to be fair Im only 25, still I think it will go down in history as one of the best presidential speeches and I think this term will be referred to as the golden age of America, just like he said.

What power would AOC have in a progressive party who won two or three seats?

Absolutely nothing is preventing more parties in our political system other than people not voting intelligently and for their own interests. We have third party representatives right now at all levels of government. People don't even know who their Mayor is or their policies. And a Mayor has vastly more control over their everyday lives than the President of the US. They just hit D or R and pat themselves on the back for voting. You seem like you might be progressive.
