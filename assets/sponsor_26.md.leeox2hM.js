What you're describing only works if the election actually _is_ a toss-up and thus the result will be within their MOE. If they were to report Harris+1 and the result is Harris+5, that's a 4 point miss and really bad for them regardless of the fact that they \\"got the right result\\".The one thing you are getting at though is that the polling is not a simple \\"call a bunch of people\\", rather they look at why their polls were off and attempt to adjust them for the next year so that they're more accurate. That could mean that this year they're oversampling Trump voters in areas they felt were under-sampled in 2016 and 2020. Or it could mean they're getting it wrong in a different way and will see a similar result.The other thing is that polling is so much out in the open now and that biases the results somewhat - pollsters might not be publishing every poll they do if they get an unexpected result.

It's pretty long but here are a few excerpts that are worth reading: I dont really do endorsements. Im not shy about sharing my views, but I hate politics and dont trust most politicians. I also understand that people want to hear from me because I am not just a celebrity, I am a former Republican Governor.  It is probably not a surprise that I hate politics more than ever, which, if you are a normal person who isnt addicted to this crap, you probably understand. I want to tune out. But I cant. Because rejecting the results of an election is as un-American as it gets. To someone like me who talks to people all over the world and still knows America is the shining city on a hill, calling America is a trash can for the world is so unpatriotic, it makes me furious.  And I will always be an American before I am a Republican. Thats why, this week, I am voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. But a candidate who wont respect your vote unless it is for him, a candidate who will send his followers to storm the Capitol while he watches with a Diet Coke, a candidate who has shown no ability to work to pass any policy besides a tax cut that helped his donors and other rich people like me but helped no one else else, a candidate who thinks Americans who disagree with him are the bigger enemies than China, Russia, or North Korea  - that wont solve our problems. It will just be four more years of bullshit with no results that makes us angrier and angrier, more divided, and more hateful. We need to close the door on this chapter of American history, and I know that former President Trump wont do that.

This is largely because **they have nothing whatsoever to sell**. \\"At least we're not as bad!\\" has *no value* as an argument to those who have already completely given up on the process. In order to get those non-voters to reengage, they would have to have something at least vaguely positive and affirmative to offer. They do not. \\"We're not as bad!\\" is the incompetent's mantra. At least Trump offers the distant hope of making it legal to take all those guns and go shoot liberals/brown people/whatever for the repub partisans and rabid MAGA types, so there's that: they have an apparently-endless supply of red meat with which to entice their base. All the dems have on offer is more of the grindingly-stupid same: genocide, endless wars, IDPol, censorship, FUD, fake joy, the occasional meaningless shiny object, and arugula and chardonnay at brunch.Taibbi's take that the dems are simply a marketing strategy, and not a functional political party, is spot on- and Harris is their poster child. They ought to put out gatefold desk signs at all the doctor and dentist offices with her face on it, and little pockets for donated dimes, like Jerry Lewis used to do. At least they'd get some \\"Awww\\" votes that way.Hear this, dems: unless and until you have something positive to offer (and the actual will to *deliver* on those positives), you will not win. Nor should you. Haranguing the people who still care enough to engage in this completely-compromised process will do nothing more than speed your demise as a functioning party. And quite frankly, this ex-dem reporter can't wait for that happy event to finally occur.Then, the Uniparty can turn its attention towards manufacturing a new controlled-opposition granfalloon to campaign negatively, and not be taken seriously.

Lets say the MOE is +-3.We would definitely expect to see Harris at 49, 48, 50, but we would also expect to see some polls with Harris at 45 or 51.  We don't see this.    We would also expect that an occasional poll would just have a true outlier outside the margin of error.  Like maybe 1 in 20 polls would show Harris at like 58. We don't see this which is indicative of poll herding.  Which means even the indie pollsters are likely making the same assumptions about the electorate together so none of them stand out.  I posted this about 2 weeks ago, but Nate Silver also posted this like yesterday saying the same thing3.  Yes, to your point it is very likely that after under counting Trump's support two elections in a row pollsters are probably being more conservative this time.  Either they are doing this well, or they went to far in the wrong direction.

Like, the crux of your position is that because corruption and poverty exists in South America, it should also exist in the US based on overwhelming whatever economic systems we have. And this is based on the assumption that the US has sole blame for the corruption and poverty. But then also, don't try to help solve the corruption or poverty because it's important that they maintain their corruption and poverty because that's better than receiving aid from the US ?? do you see how holding one view makes the other view inconsistent? Like first you're admitting US supremacy such that it's the one place people can have prosperity. Second, you're taking a form of nation reparations off the table to help redress whatever harm you're pinning on the US in South America.?\\nAnd is this dynamic not also true then for every sovereign nation? Isn't it true that most land has been occupied by different groups, even warring tribes, and therefore in 2024 everyone who can't trace their family history to the exact area they currently live, should be subject to displacement by any other group deemed to be directly or indirectly harmed by not having access to that country? Because, many South Americans are just as exogenous? to the US as they are to China or France or Nigeria or Saudi Arabia. So, OPEC impacts Venezuela. So should Venezuelans have access to OPEC countries instead of the US??\\nThe point is, I don't think the person you responded to or many people in this post... Or voters in general, are against immigration and granting asylum. But your underlying premises are pretty unpopular and not very pragmatic--moving forward. Handling people already here, sure.

The for your body part confuses me a bit. In your own post you say things like:?the end product less beneficial and more harmful, and causing more harm to animals and environment.And the other commenter on this comment has given other examples. You yourself are not consistent with the for your body qualifier, but then youre hostile to me?I don't even know if you understand the difference between profitability, production cost, and products being deemed as expensiveThere is no need for the hostile tone.?You seem to have different views in your post. In the title, the view just is that these non-beneficial-for-body-things are correlated with being more profitable.Later, you express a broader view: So because a product is profitable, there is an overvaluation of benefit against an undervaluation of harm, not like actual benefit drops and harm increases when a price is increased. And we have a weird trade-off of experience and perception over good care of the body;For the view expressed in the title, you concede you have no data, but it was just something that came to mind. Without clear data of profitability we have to infer how profitable products are. I know many examples of products which are better for your body, which seem to have high profit margins. One way that you inferred the profit margins of fake meat is by saying these are produced at the cost of vegetables aka low cost. But they are sold at a high price which makes the margins high.\\nBut I dispute this, by saying fake meat is expensive to produce, and so the margins are not as high as you think they are. Profitability and product cost are obviously linked.?I expect that meat substitute is more profitable and healthier than bad meat. But I cant make that case as we dont know the exact health effects and profitability of both I am just guessing, as you are.Then you conclude with another view, which is about why bad things have higher profit margins. In the cases I described earlier(fancy water etc.), it seems that the experience and perception is related to good care of the body. There is no trade off between them, the experience relies on it being good for you, and that creates higher profits.?\\nSo often, the difference that you want to highlight isnt there:And I want to highlight the difference in what the body needs and what the experiencer wants in their perspective of risk and reward?You have a whole story about how this correlation came into being, but the view that there is a correlation is not adequately argued. You say:?I worked it out and seems to have correlationWhat do you mean you worked it out? You said you dont have data, you dont have an analysis. Is seems to me like a hunch. What can a commenter do to disprove this hunch? I have shown how there are very profitable products that are healthy, perhaps the healthiest products are those with high profit margins as they are branded as luxury. Or healthy medicines which are insanely profitable due to patents and monopolies(like insulin). What could I to convince you that the correlation is not there?","title":"CMV: There is correlation in the more profitable a good is, the less beneficial and the more harmful it is for your body, and vice versa."},{"text":"I thought they had PA locked down because of the Amish vote? /s","title":"Trump having a meltdown, claiming mass cheating at \\"levels rarely seen before\\", demands followers report it to authorities."},{"text":"Exactly.

We take in massive amount of information at every single moments of our lives. People aren't educated on media literacy to analyze this information and their sources.

People are constantly manipulated by institutions and individuals they \\"should\\" and shouldn't trust leading to people unable to determine fact from fiction. FYI, I still believe my comment is still simple in many ways when it comes to this issue.

Another example I can think of is Vance stating immigrants are eating cats and dogs.A quote from this book that I think is fitting: \\"Once the public accepts the comfort of conspiracy thinking as an explanation of irrational fears and resentments, it's members will cease to be guided by reason in political deliberation.\\" While he specifically states reason ceases in political deliberation, I think one can use this further to reasonable thinking ceases to exist.Then, take into account that Trumps built a cult of personality along with other fascist tools Staley describes. Propaganda and disinformation, the mythic past (MAGA), victimhood, law and order, anti-intellectual, sexual anxiety, Sodom and Gomorrah, and albeit Macht frei. These fascist methods are proven to work by manipulating a population. Regardless of intelligence and no due to wanting to feel like for once they aren't the last to know something. Obviously Fascism isn't the only reason people believe lies and conspiracies though. We all know humans are drawn to outlandish stories such as myths, legends and fantasies. Part of this plays into why some believe conspiracies. Possibly another reasoning is also due to misinformation, the lack of trust in institutions, trust in other institutions, and education. We are faced with conflicting information at all times. Phones, TV, billboards, pamphlets, newspapers, social media, etc. I think it would be safe to assume that society never expected the impact all of these, mainly technology, to have on us. We never fully prepared for the issues that came out of having so much information and sources presented to us. So much so that many weren't, and still aren't, taught the media literacy skills required to benefit society today. This, couple with frequent distrust in many institutions due to previous lies and manipulation, and people will believe only what they want to believe.Due to many factors including, but not limited to, all the above about Fascism and media literacy, people trust in institutions that lack factuality and credibility. The study \\"Trust but verify? Examining the role of trust in institutions in the spread of unverified information on social media\\" finds that unverified information spreads due to the trust in institutions. This creates an overconfidence in detecting misinformation and reduction in the motivation to verify info.","title":"CMV: People who believe everything is a lie and have a conspiracy theory for everything do so because they need to feel like for once they arent the last to know something"},{"text":"In my state, poll workers ensure privacy in the voting booth.

The \\"benefits\\" of food area fairly clear: it's a necessity you need to survive and some parts of it allow you to live healthier. The \\"harm\\" is the food being unhealthy upon ingestion, either due to added chemicals, poor processing or simply because it's a bad mixture of things.For beauty products the \\"benefit\\" is... looking good? You yourself write that it's not a necessity and that it's an outlier, but then go on to still apply your view, so it seems to still work? I don't think there is a \\"high benefit\\" here at all - you would need to define a \\"benefit\\" very differently to that of food for it to still make sense. Does food that helps you with looking good subsequently also carry a larger \\"benefit\\"? How do you weigh it against the nutritional \\"benefit\\"?And the \\"harm\\" for beauty products is \\"toxic ingredients\\", which seems like a fair comparison... but then, when comparing vaseline and \\"high end beauty products\\", you say that \\"The harm is again mostly outsourced to the environment and wildlife\\". Is \\"harm to the environment\\" included in the \\"harm\\" of food, as well? If so, you might want to rethink your stance on meat vs. meat substitutes, because - and I say this as a non-vegetarian - the environmental impact of meat is significantly more harmful than that of substitutes. Again: how do you weigh the two against one another?There's a discrepancy there. You apply different standards for different groups (which is fine), but then draw a correlation that you could only draw if you apply the same standards.No, considering your second paragraph. It's much more than that. The illusion of safety and security cost way more than actual safety and security. The body doesn't need much, and there aren't many dangers to protect us from. But that's really boring, so we crave all kinds of dangers and experiences, and like to play with the balanceLet me get this straight... we crave danger and pay a lot of money to be protected from said danger? Do you not see some sort of problem here?And our economy is increasingly operating on perceived value over actual value because that's the most profitable.**Every** economy that has ever existed operates on *percieved* value, because things do not have an objective value. The fundamental principle of supply and demand is founded on this idea. Wheat doesn't gain value if there was a bad harvest - it still fullfills the same role as it did before, has the same nutritional value, etc. It gains *percieved* value due to the scarcity and fear of not having enough.I believe you're attempting to force a correlation to be much stronger than it actually is. There is a correlation between profit margin and safety of the product, of course, but that is a correlation that breaks down in many places. To fix those places, you then talk about the \\"percieved value\\" of a product.I think I know what you're getting at: \\"If a product is more expensive, we percieve it as more safe and better, even if it's not.\\" That is a true psychological phenomenon and used in many marketing stategies, similar to the \\"luxury effect\\" of something, at some point, being bought precisely because it has a high price, ignoring other parameters. This is all known well and true - but it does **not** support any idea of \\"the more profitable a good is, the less beneficial and the more harmful it is for your body, and vice versa.\\" *At best*, it describes the absence of a correlation between profitability and benefit beyond a certain point.","title":"CMV: There is correlation in the more profitable a good is, the less beneficial and the more harmful it is for your body, and vice versa."},{"text":"We all know who is cheating.

In the end it's always going to competitively beat meat because meat requires so much more to produce.Okay so you've now elaborated that you're talking about levels of profitability between mature markets. How do you account for things like protected origin status? Parmesan cheese with a DOP designation sells more and at a premium (and thus is more profitable) compared to a parmesan-style cheese made from Brazilian dairy cows. Under your logic that would mean real Pamesean is worse for you than the imitation. However, if the DOP designation didn't exist and consumers didn't have a reliable way to distinguish between Italian and Brazilian cheese, the cheaper Brazilian milk/labor would probably result in more profitable cheese. Using your logic that means the existence of the EU regulatory state makes Italian cheese less good for you. That doesn't make any sense to me.\\\\ So here we have for example illegal tobacco, that is much more profitable than legal tobacco if it can be sold at the same cost. Consumers hardly notice the difference, Illegal cigarettes tend to be even more harmful so of less quality than the legal ones.Two points here1. It isn't the tobacco leaves that are illegal (illegal in this case meaning traded on the black market without tax), it's the tobacco products like cigarettes. You have not addressed the discrepancy between tobacco leaf growing and cigarette production profitability. Similarly, you did not address the difference in profitability between soda production and high fructose corn syrup production.2. Of course illegal cigarettes would be more profitable if they could be sold at the same cost. But people take the risk to buy illegal cigarettes because they are cheaper. Also, illegal cigarettes are usually the same product smuggled from other areas with lower excise taxes and not produced underground (at least in the US).","title":"CMV: There is correlation in the more profitable a good is, the less beneficial and the more harmful it is for your body, and vice versa."},{"text":"So long as youre OK with this being reciprocal:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change","title":"cmv: Foreign interference in U.S media generally, or more specifically during election periods should be treated as acts of open warfare and responded to with overwhelming force."},{"text":"Can someone fill me in on what happened?

The potential to repurpose an already approved, accessible medication like fenbendazole represents an exciting advancement for cancer treatments, but further investigation is required to establish its role in cancer therapy.","title":"This is an Orwellian nightmare Politico just edited the Bidens trump supporters comments"},{"text":" No event she could go to will have 1/10th the audience Rogan offers.Again - you are missing the forest for the Trees.She had a scheduled event on Tuesday.

From 2018 to 2028 the market is expected to rise from 4.6 to 16.6. Profitability is also jumping on emergent markets at a first cost but at greater future returns. And upscaling hugely influences profitability, it's always a huge population/sales market issue.Consider this: turning soy into a high end processed meat alternative is huge value creation. In the end it's always going to competitively beat meat because meat requires so much more to produce.Tobacco is another interesting example I haven't considered. You're saying that only established brands make profits. Looking into it it seems tobacco farmers make less money than growing other crops. The consumer based benefit is almost completely experiential, which differs from most consumable goods. There are some claims of health benefit, mostly we agree on it's harmful effects.So here we have for example illegal tobacco, that is much more profitable than legal tobacco if it can be sold at the same cost. Consumers hardly notice the difference, Illegal cigarettes tend to be even more harmful so of less quality than the legal ones.All in all considering it has very little benefit to the body and huge cost instead, despite it being very profitable cigarettes certainly follow the same pattern. And it's very much an identity thing, marketing for cigarettes as being cool has reached a global population, and wether its positive or negative consuming cigarettes reinforces that identity.","title":"CMV: There is correlation in the more profitable a good is, the less beneficial and the more harmful it is for your body, and vice versa."},{"text":"All that inclusion and tolerance on full display.

Well the government is literally hiding something the commission on that said that they would release the documents 50 years later and come the time to release the government internal documents on that they decided to put it off for another couple of decades I have no idea why there would be any conspiracy theories..Conspiracy theory the covid 19 virus was created in a lab. Now the FBI the CIA the health department and most of the government admit yeah the covid virus was probably made in the Coronavirus research lab in the city that it came from I'm still shocked by this who could have seen that coming.Crazy conspiracy theory number 3 the covid vaccine is not a vaccine in the traditional sense and does not really stop you from getting covid and you can still transmit it. Of course only morons and conspiracy theorists would believe that.. well shoot turns out that you can get covid the protection last a couple of months what little there was and you can still transmit it personally I was flabbergasted I had no idea.Conspiracy theory number 4 Joe Biden and his family were making millions of dollars off of Government grift Hunter got high and left his laptop at a computer repair shop and never picked it up. Now we all know that 51 intelligence agents from the CIA and defense department said it was just a Russian Hack and this information and we shouldn't believe it it was a dumb conspiracy theory. Turns out the laptop was real Joe Biden is the big guy and over 20 million dollars was paid to his brother his business partner confirmed it and the CIA has been able to confirm it and oh by the way the FBI literally used it as evidence against Hunter at a trial saying that it was real. I mean that one is simply shocking nobody could have possibly known that was going to end up being the case.Conspiracy theory there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq the government just wanted to go in because W's butt was hurt because his daddy didn't finish the job properly in iraq.

And even if they still have the majority, he would need every Republican member to back this plan, which is unlikely--I believe there would remain enough non-MAGA ones to refuse to countenance such a thing.If the EV margin is wide enough, the plan is DOA, however.

This approval, which includes robust monitoring and evaluation, empowers the state to better manage costs and target resources when delivering high-quality patient care for more than 1.4 million Tennesseans, many of whom continue to reel from the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.Two and a half years after the considerable fanfare, the Trump administration CMS announced the approval of a Medicaid aggregate cap waiver for Tennessee with The Governor was more forthcoming, trumpeting the states receipt of a block grant waiver.

Conspiracy theories exist on a spectrum from absurd to plausible to almost certain depending on several factors.

Theres no logical reason anyone would push that narrative, and its easily disproven with fairly basic thinking and a level of math and physics most people can do for themselves.Others, like the idea that 9/11 was known about or possibly orchestrated to gain public support for a war, feel more plausible. The CIA has planned similar operations before, and it wouldnt need thousands of people to pull off, just a smaller, contained group.Then there are claims that are almost certainly true, like widespread PED use among pro athletes. Anonymous studies have shown nearly half of athletes admitted to using banned substances, even if only a tiny percentage test positive. Sports organizations have strong incentives to protect their image, and athletes have every reason to cheat.(Just to clarify, Im not claiming 9/11 was or wasnt an inside job, I havent looked into it that deep but I do believe PED use is rampant in pro sports.)","title":"CMV: People who believe everything is a lie and have a conspiracy theory for everything do so because they need to feel like for once they arent the last to know something"},{"text":"burnt to fucking ash","title":"Shock Poll Says Kamala Harris Within Striking Distance of Trump in Kansas"},{"text":"Anyone who supports garbage is, in fact, by association, garbage.Racism = garbage Welcome to my Ted talk.","title":"Biden's 'garbage' remarks give Trump and GOP new fodder on the trail"},{"text":"He didn't say voters were trash, he said their hate was trash.Fine line but easily distinguishable.Whoever said it in a post yesterday was right...

Granted it flipped back to Democrats, but its been democrat for over 50 years so its possible.

The term Romneycare frankly doesn't make much sense, because the bill was passed by huge liberal democratic supermajorities in the state legislature, and Romney only reluctantly signed it, while vetoing various parts via line item veto (all the vetoes were overridden by the state legislature). So it doesn't make sense to give Romney the credit. And Romney was hardly representative of the Republican party as a whole. He was (at the time - he later moved to the right) one of those weird northeastern Republicans who was very centrist and arguably actually leaned ever so slightly liberal (contrasted to someone like Collins who is now just moderate conservative with a definite emphasis on conservative). The national party didn't even remotely stand for the sort of things he was standing for.Just think about this. In 2014, Louisiana elected Democrat John Bel Edwards as Governor. Edwards was liberal on some issues, he pushed for education funding and also pushed to get the medicaid expansion from the ACA enacted in his state. But he was also very strongly pro life, and signed a bill banning all abortions, with no exceptions for rape and incest, with harsh penalties for doctors who perform abortions. Now, imagine a scenario where J.D. Vance gets elected in the future, passes a national abortion ban with no exceptions for rape and incest and with harsh penalties for doctors who perform abortions - and then he tries to spin it as actually a democratic bill by pointing to Edwards in Louisiana, and using this to act like the bill was a moderate or even liberal bill and that the Dems nationally must be radicals with no real plan, if they oppose it. Wouldn't you agree that it would be extremely dishonest and in bad faith for the Republicans to make such an argument?So Romneycare wasn't conservative or representative of where the mainstream Republican party stood at the time, and arguably shouldn't even be called Romneycare in the first place. Using Romneycare to argue that Obamacare was moderate/conservative/the Republican healthcare solution, is thus *kind of bullshit*which in turn was based on a Heritage Foundation white paper.The Heritage plan was not identical to Obamacare, Obamacare was rather more liberal in various ways. The main similarity between the two was the individual mandate, but then the individual mandate was never that significant in terms of the policy itself, and got way more hype arguably than it ever deserved. Obamacares biggest part in terms of actually expanding coverage was the medicaid expansion, which was just absent from the Heritage plan, and that was far from the only difference between Obamacare and the Heritage plan. Furthermore, the Heritage plan was *also* not really The Republican Plan. It was a plan that emerged from some conservative think tank and was largely irrelevant. Then Bill Clinton pushed for universal healthcare, and *some* Republicans initially got spooked and felt like they needed to have a counteroffer, so *some* Republicans in Congress started tepidly pushing the Heritage plan as an alternative. Even at that point though, the GOP was very divided between that, some other plans, and the status quo option. And then the Clintoncare push fell apart and it became clear that the general public was actually fine with the status quo option, so the GOP abandoned healthcare reform proposals altogether, with the Heritage plan being one of those plans that just got tossed aside the moment it was clear the GOP didn't even need it.So the Heritage plan was more conservative than Obamacare to begin with, and the Heritage plan was never even what the majority of the GOP actually wanted at the time anyway, it was just a fig leaf *some* republicans held up for a little while before the general public made it clear they didn't actually need the GOP to even hold up a fig leaf **So no, Obamacare was absolutely not the Republican healthcare solution**.

Coca-Cola on the other hand, is a brand with brand loyalty that allows it to raise its prices and command much higher profit margins.?\\nOr take tobacco and Marlboro cigarettes. Production of tobacco is not a particularly profitable enterprise, but an individual cigarette brand is often quite profitable.It seems clear to me that in this case the difference is commodities versus branded products and not some sort of health/benefit component.","title":"CMV: There is correlation in the more profitable a good is, the less beneficial and the more harmful it is for your body, and vice versa."},{"text":"That's been my thoughts since '16.Trump '16 voter: Maybe uneducated, maybe bigoted, maybe just na?ve about who the man truly is.Trump '20 voter: Definitely uneducated, most likely bigoted, willingly na?ve about who the man truly is.Trump '24 voter: Absolutely uneducated, undeniably bigoted, completely utterly aware of who the man truly is, and they like it.","title":"MAGA world fumes as Biden says: 'Only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters'"},{"text":"You can be opposed to some of Harris' policies without being pro-Trump.","title":"What Kamala Harris' troubling embrace of war hawks means | Kamala Harris' embrace of Ritchie Torres and Liz Cheney spells trouble for her progressive support."},{"text":"Theyre projecting.

Imagine the opposite.  Imagine if there were huge profit margin on essential goods like air, water, and vegetables.  This would be a nightmare.  It would a setting for a dark dystopian nightmare where greedy corporations have made it illegal for people to collect rain water so they can charge 20 dollars a gallon.  It would be the worst kind of economy you could imagine.we want there to be low profit margins on essentially goods, because low profit margins means those goods will be more affordable.  We want an economic system that drives down the profit margin on those goods.Is that actually what has happened?  with water and basic food stuff, yea.  that is what happened.Are there other outliers? Vaccines are extremely profitableyou could probably add almost all medicine as an outlier.  From certain life saving antibiotics to insulin.  After air, water, food, and medicine the only other thing that is really really good for humans is shelter.  These 5 things (medicine only sometimes) are required for life.  Shelter i would say has a high profit margin.  Builders has a low margins, but banks are almost always involved in the purchase of shelter.  Mortgages don't really have profit margins in the conventional sense, but the bank makes a LOT of money over a 30 year mortgage.  So I think shelter has a pretty high profit margin. 3 out of the 5 things required for life have low margins.  Pretty good.  Not great.","title":"CMV: There is correlation in the more profitable a good is, the less beneficial and the more harmful it is for your body, and vice versa."},{"text":"In fairness, anyone who was ok with Trump calling the left the enemy from within and implying the military would take care of it is garbage.","title":"\\"The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.\\" - Joe Biden"},{"text":"Ive never seen a bigger group of whiny babies than American conservatives.","title":"Biden brands Trump supporters garbage  sparking fury among Republicans  as White House tries to cover for him"},{"text":"When they were kids they would hit people in the back, then cry like little bitches when someone whipped around and asked them to stop.","title":"MSM desperate to help turn Bidens comment into a controversy"},{"text":"In general they tend to be unintelligent peopleOne of the biggest \\"conspiracy theorists\\" in human history was Bobby Fisher.

Like, if there *were* a shadowy group pulling the strings behind the scenes, that is somehow more comforting to them than the idea that we are all riding on a train with no driver over tracks that look like a bowl of spaghetti. It doesn't even matter that the group is nefarious. At least **someone** is in charge. And, if someone is in charge, that means we can get a handle on things by putting the right people in charge instead of the shadowy group. But, facts are that no one is in charge, and no one can put things right all by themselves. And, that fact scares the shit out of people, so they make up stories that tell them the world has order. Doesn't matter that the current order is bad; it is better than chaos.

Compensatory control theory proposes that people experiencing control loss seek epistemic structure to order erratic environments [2]. In conspiracy theories, this structure derives from powerful actors coordinating in secret. While such machinations are not particularly comforting, perceiving conspiracies can feel preferable to inexplicable chaos.

Apparently SOME conspiracy theories (JFK and Epstein) are okay. Let's face it, for the most part whether or not something in a conspiracy theory or not many times depends on who you ask. Many people think Epstein and JFK are in fact conspiracy theory.  With that said, I find in my personal life that generally speaking many of the conspiracy minded folks I come across are intelligent but seem to struggle disconnecting their emotions (fear, faith, etc.) from the information they read. They are the people whom (at least in my estimation) place their \\"truths\\" and/or belief system foremost in their minds. They filter everything through this belief system and cannot accept any other conclusions. It isn't that they cannot parse information or understand information, more than they cannot do so without emotional entanglement.  \\nFor instance - There is a woman I know who is gay. Being older (50's) she struggled through some very difficult times as an openly gay woman. Being gay IS her identity. She identifies everything around her through the filter of being a gay woman. Because she is gay, struggled through hard years for a gay woman, everywhere she looks she sees prejudice and hatred. Every (even innocent) comment or look that she feels is odd, she is ready for a fight. (like seriously, actual fights). She is really hard to be around. Conversely her partner, for whom being gay is WHAT she is not WHO she is and thus is less of how she identifies with the world, doesn't see the same hate and disgust everywhere she looks. I liken conspiracy theorist to this sort of---ummm---identity crisis (?) approach to the world. They are so wrapped up in how the \\"feel\\" about a situation.   \\nIn my circle is a \\"15 minute cities are the tools of the Devil\\" kind of guy. There is nothing I can say to him to convince him that 15 minute cities (as a planning concept) has been around since the 1960's and, in some lesser forms, already exist in many areas across the world (as a civic planning concept). He is SO worried about Government control and stripping our freedoms that his fear of that excludes him from seeing 15 minutes cities as anything other than evil. In nearly all other aspects of his life he is markedly intelligent. He could build a working rocket from a pile of garbage behind the barn, has 2 Engineering degrees, a English degree, worked for a engineering publication for years, he is calm and a very reasonable person in nearly all other aspects --- other than 15 minute cities.  I come across a good number of conspiracy folks like him.

The concerns over a shortage of interceptors have prompted senior Pentagon officials, including Del Toro, and Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr., chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, to look at alternate technology, including drawing on newer companies to help increase production of new types of air-defense missiles.  The U.S. had built up interceptor stocks over recent years, but the U.S. in any one month of the conflict in the Middle East has launched dozens of missiles, and production capacity cant keep up, according to analysts and defense officials. RTX, producer of the Standard Missiles, can make a maximum of a few hundred a year, a U.S. defense official said. That production, however, isnt all for the Pentagon, since at least 14 allies also buy Standard Missiles, according to RTX. The U.S. launched a dozen Standard Missiles during Irans Oct. 1 missile attack on Israel, in addition to employing other air-defense systems, but American and Israeli forces let through some of the 180 Iranian missiles that they knew wouldnt strike valuable sites to preserve its stock of interceptors, U.S. officials said. Pentagon officials said the plan is to maintain the current overall production levels of the Standard Missiles, though there will be cuts to some of the older variants to fund newer ones. The heavy use of weapons such as interceptors in the Middle East is also putting at risk the Pentagons ability to fight in the Pacific, said Mark Montgomery, a retired rear admiral and now a senior director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a conservative think tank in Washington.  Were spending a years worth of Standard Missilesthose are standard missiles that are supposed to be part of rearming ourselves for China, he said.

And his followers, who claim to be people of God, despite Trump's morals being everything that God isn't, praise him and act like he was sent by Jesus himself to save America.","title":"\\"The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.\\" - Joe Biden"},{"text":"Quit lying.

The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His - his - his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American. It's totally contrary to everything we've done, everything we've been.\\" ([SOURCE](https://youtu.be/F54hZP_rWiU?si=bEXi5b50D8FX5dVj))If you are going to quote him, make sure you get it right. Now, if we take the quote and the way he spoke it, you'll notice a couple things. First, he clearly paused after he said: \\"his supporters\\". Anyone familiar with English can clearly tell that was the end of his sentence. Just listen to it, it's obvious. Second, what follows is a complete sentence (\\"His - his - his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American) and combining it with the previous sentence would result in a sentence that wouldn't make sense. Here's what it would say if you combined it:\\"The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American.\\"Even if you alter it to try and make it make sense by removing a word, it still doesn't make sence:\\"The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter's demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American.\\"You'd have to get rid of half the second sentence to make it work. Altering what he said that much isn't just fixing a little gaffe, it changes the entire context of the comment, and it is irresponsible to do that. It's not like he just misspoke a single word.People are grasping at straws by trying to justify what he said. It's pitiful.Edit (since I can't reply to those who commented on this): All I'm doing is taking what he said at face value. People in this post are weaving his words together in a way that supports the claim that Biden said something that he clearly didn't mean. I'm just taking what he said plainly. You shouldn't have to do a bunch of mental gymnastics to morph his words into something that sounds good. Sounds like you are trying hard to justify what he said. How when Biden or Kamala say something dumb, you just acknowledge it instead of fighting tooth and nail and saying \\"Well, what they REALLY meant was...\\". I would have a lot more respect for some dems if they would just admit when their candidates said somthing awful. Like with Trump's cat and dog comment during the debate. I'll be the first one to tell you that was a stupid thing to say, and even if there is some evidence, it was delivered in a way that sounded rediculous. But seemingly every lib on reddit acts as though Biden and Kamala can do NO wrong, and it is exhausting.","title":"Biden sets off a firestorm with his response to Trump rally comedian's Puerto Rico comments"},{"text":"His supporters are garbage just like him.

In modern, highly developed economies, most economic value is in the form of services. Even within the primary and secondary sectors, you acknowledge that many industries don't obviously follow the pattern. I'd go further and say that there are also industries that you don't mention whose products seem to have minimal implications for the body one way or the other. Are they also exceptions, or just worthless?It also doesn't seem like you have a coherent definition of harm. Your stated view seems to concern harm to the body of the consumer. But then you also mention environmental degradation and harm to other people or species. Furthermore, you only seem to appeal to these other forms of harm when direct harm to the body doesn't seem to correlate with the pattern you predict. All this gives your idea the feel of a Just-so story. When a product superficially conforms to your narrative, you don't inquire any further. When a product doesn't, you search througg an ever broadening set of factors until you can find a harm or benefit that you can treat as a validation of your view. If you can't find a harm that offsets the apparent benefits of a profitable product, like in the case of pharmaceuticals, you just intimate that there's an unidentified harm or lack of benefit without committing to what it might be. You treat your view as if it must be true. This brings me to the question of what might change your view? What specific claims are you willing to commit to?","title":"CMV: There is correlation in the more profitable a good is, the less beneficial and the more harmful it is for your body, and vice versa."},{"text":"'That's some catch, that catch-22,' he observed. \\n'It's the best there is,' Doc Daneeka agreed.\\"","title":"Man serving 30 years for attacking Nancy Pelosis husband gets a life term on state charges"},{"text":"She looks just like the turd she is!","title":"Kamala Wearing Her Best Brown Shirt Before Giving a Speech at the DNC in August"},{"text":"He already clarified what he meant so this should just be over if the media doesnt insist on blowing it up.

They often donate large sums to other celebrities foundations, creating this you scratch my back, Ill scratch yours network.Donations to these foundations are tax exempt under 501(c)(3) and the foundations themselves are also tax exempt, so its essentially a way to grow their funds and avoid paying taxes. Plus, they can write off expenses as charity related, like accommodations, private flights, security, and sometimes even high end designer wardrobes for these events. eg - Meghan Markles many obnoxiously over the top designer outfits at the Invictus Games which raised a lot of eyebrows. Directors or board members can also be paid salaries, which isnt unusual in a nonprofit but sometimes feels like a majorly dodgy loophole. Youll notice that most big names have one of these NFPs.

Major steps are being taken to save an ocean critter critical to the ecosystem: the sunflower sea star.  After disease nearly wiped out the population across the west coast about 10 years ago, University of Washington researchers were tasked with saving the species. Using some of the few existing sea stars in the Friday Harbor region, scientists, led by researcher Jason Hodin, bred and nurtured multiple generations of lab-grown sea stars.   The breeding process started in 2019 and finally, in August, the years of waiting came to fruition and the first group of lab-grown sea stars was released into the wild for the first time ever.  Weve been talking about this for five years now, its pretty exciting, said Hodin on the day of the release. For a quick rundown for those who don't know, a wasting disease killed basically all of the population of Sunflower Sea Stars on the West Coast in 2014 and those Sea Stars eat purple sea urchins which in turn eat kelp.

Medicine can literally save your life and be prohibitively expensive at the same time, even with immense profit margins. You gloss over this for vaccines by effecitively saying \\"surely they can't be as good as it seems\\":First of all there isn't enough good data and very little research on the harmful side. That leads to a convoluted perceived value as the expected value doesn't take it into account. Yet there is the huge attribution of sound science to the perceived value of any vaccine, people hardy question them.Vaccines, and medicine in general, go through rigorous testing before they are available to the public in most countries. There is a **lot** of data on the harmful effects of vaccines and most medicine - and it's usually very positive. So for this part, at the very least, it seems like you are trying to find a way to make your hypothesis work in the face of evidence to the contrary.Likewise, you don't explore the opposite: there are a lot of very cheap things (that aren't profitable either) that are extremely bad for you. In fact, it can often be said that \\"the cheaper the product, the more likely it is to harm you\\", as costs are cut in places where safety is important.So really, it seems to me like you specifically pick out a few key examples that seem to support your view and ignore all counterexamples. Of course there is some truth to your view in that \\"safety and security cost money\\", and thus reduce profit margins. But to expand that to some universal truth is a very far reach.I could link a source to every sentence, but you can just copypaste it and find it, I kept to the obvious in order to focus on the connections and not argue over details.You should really link at least controversial statements like \\"the harmful effects of vaccines aren't well-researched\\".

I think you need more data to make that claim. There is always a disconnect between actual value for your health and perceived value. And companies will always try to ramp up the perceived value. But having healthy things is often branded as a luxury. Cheap off brand energy drink is very cheap. Alkaline water from Canadian Ice caps is very expensive. Biologically produced tomatoes are insanely expensive. On meat substitutes, it depends on what substitutes you talk about. Isolating different vegetable proteins and blending it in a fake meat that tastes like real meat is pretty expensive process, and these products are more expensive that cheap meat full of water and antibiotics. Good meat may be better than meat substitutes, but bad meat probably isnt. ?A part of the increased cost of these green healthy products is that they are expensive to make, but branding is also a large part. The demographic who wants to buy healthy food have more money to spare and are willing to throw cash on something if they think it is healthier. This leads many healthy products to be kind of luxury product. And luxury products get much better markups than basic mass produced shit?And a point about meat substitutes: people arent just willing to pay more because they think its healthier. They are willing to pay more because they want to help the environment or dont want to kill animals.

My definition of colonial state here is a state that was built by outsiders and on land that was inhabited by other people who are subsequently evicted and/or marginalized.Part of the discussion that often gets looked over with claims like these is that Jews were immigrants. As in, they legally immigrated to both Ottoman Syria and British Mandatory Palestine. As in, they were citizens of Ottoman Syria and British Mandatory Palestine.This is why arguments like this are often met with accusations of antisemitism. There is something ... reminiscent of a time period around 70 years ago ... about calling Jewish citizens \\"outsiders\\" and claiming that because they are \\"outsiders\\" they shouldn't get certain fundamental rights that all citizens have.Israel simply could not possibly be colonialist because it was a country founded by citizens of the previous country declaring independence in the midst of a civil war (a war fought between civilians of a single country, not a war fought between foreigners).genetic testing confirms that modern Palestinians share a common origin with modern Jewish peopleIt should be clarified that this is only a given percentage of Palestinians, it isn't all of them. Many Palestinians are immigrants from various Arab countries without any ancestral connection to the land. This is why a lot of their names are stuff like \\"Ben from Egypt\\" or \\"Jodie from Lebanon\\" or \\"Bill the Iranian.\\" Hussein of the MacMahon-Hussein correspondence was born in Constantinople and was descended from Saudi Arabians. In fact, Palestine was meant to be created as a colonial state -- that's why it's referred to \\"The Arab Nation.\\" It was meant to be a sort of client country of the Arab empire, who have colonized pretty much the whole of the middle east into what they term \\"The Arab Nation.\\" Both governments of Palestine actually still support this concept if I'm not mistaken, so they both advocate for a form of colonialism (being ruled by a foreign entity) which the Palestinians in Israel are not subject to.","title":"CMV: Israel is a colonial state"},{"text":"I am here to remind you that you are a person, and not just a cloud of terrifying thoughts","title":"Discussion Thread"},{"text":"I guess it's good to know what narrative the other side is peddling.","title":"Donald Trump's Chances of Winning Election Rise After Joe Biden's 'Garbage' Remarks"},{"text":"I don't think a lot of people who are all offended by the joke even realize that.

Its perfectly fine to be pissed by that deal and to consider it unfair.

I do want to challenge your view, but the bit I want to challenge is the concept of \\"our society\\".It's very easy to look at this situation as \\"the far right outsiders trying to manipulate good Americans into behaving like extremists\\" if your basic fundamental view is of America as a holistic thing, with a broadly established constitutional consensus determining the principles of a common agreed life.But the republic (small r)'s constitution is a compromise grounding framework, designed to encourage people to have a kind of baseline sense of what it means to work together - this is the basis of the \\"Melting Pot\\".  There are things that people do not agree on, and that's okay, they don't typically have to agree on everything in order to continue to work together, to trade, to negotiate with each other, to build communities to shield against natural disasters and attempts to steal and harm and subjugate from one another.The constitution doesn't necessarily mean that your neighbours have a shared future vision with you, just that you have terms of civility.  In the international context, the same is true of the relationships between leaders of nations - as the leader of Happyland I might not necessarily be on the best of terms with the leader and the founding principles of Violenceland, but we can still establish international summits and agree not to shoot each other for the purposes of discussion and negotiation.It is very possible, in a republic with a fairly restrained constitutional mandate, that a great many of my neighbours might actually be on opposing sides from me of a very politically important international conflict.  If push came to shove and an extremist force from Violenceland were to decide to execute all the Greens, since Happyland has been founded on principles of accepting differences of opinion, we might well find that the Reds living in Happyland are actually perfectly okay with this happening and have been wanting it for centuries.  Because Happyland never forced the issue, it hadn't been an obstacle to peaceful living together.I think what should potentially come under scrutiny is this idea of the unity of Americans, and hence of the idea of a sharp dividing line between Foreign and Internal in your proposed views.  All of the \\"media interference\\" you're talking about is only a threat because it resonates with and swells the values of Conservative America; the real problem, as it were, is that these values are things we can work around temporarily and in select, limited capacities, but fundamentally diverge from what we believe a better world should like.  These values have always been here, but they've been emboldened and no longer want to compromise; as a result, America is a deeply divided nation, and perhaps terminally so.","title":"cmv: Foreign interference in U.S media generally, or more specifically during election periods should be treated as acts of open warfare and responded to with overwhelming force."},{"text":"Dude was brollick son","title":"Young Michelle Obama"},{"text":"Wow they polled enough people that quickly?

I've been toying with the terms \\"Huxley syndrome\\" and \\"big brother syndrome\\" to describe the combination of righteous indignation, modernized 2 minutes hate (this strange permission to dehumanize anyone who doesn't submit to cult behaviour being approved by the MSM/circle D on a daily basis, while being completely oblivious/amnestic to its roots), and whatever this bizarre combination of Stockholm syndrome and battered wife syndrome has become among the NPC masses.The surest way to work up a crusade in favor of some good cause is to promise people they will have a chance of maltreating someone. To be able to destroy with good conscience, to be able to behave badly and call your bad behavior 'righteous indignation'  this is the height of psychological luxury, the most delicious of moral treats. - Aldous HuxleyAs often as I see people calling actual unbiased informative journalism \\"right wing biased,\\" it's made me realize that they've become so conditioned to the leading language and confirmation bias of corporate \\"journalism\\" that any absence of those factors makes them recoil into a defensive posture. Years of being put through a captured re-education system combined with trigger words like \\"unfounded,\\" \\"baseless,\\" and \\"far right\\" (for example) have programmed the masses into believing that everything they do is good and justified because the \\"*others*\\" maybe *just might* do something worse. This is why the phrase \\"by any means necessary\\" has been so effective. It's literal brainwashing. I've had my suspicions for years, but during covid hysteria I became certain that I was correct. Censorship of any non-submissive behaviour or thought combined with the \\"approved\\" groupthink of casting people out based on simple questions and observations about the jab confirmed it. The \\"healthcare is a human right\\" crowd decided that access to hospitals/healthcare should be withheld from anyone who didn't line up for the experiment. The \\"bodily autonomy\\" crowd wanted people to be forced into taking the jab. And the \\"everyone I disagree with is a notsee\\" crowd collectively decided that concentration camps were the best way to deal with the non-submissive.Back in the late 50's and early 60's the CIA had, as part of its mkultra program, what they called the Alice in wonderland technique. Subjects would be put through extremely long sessions of having nonsensical and contradictory information barked at them by multiple people in an overlapping fashion. Days and days of no sleep combined with this rigorous routine would ultimately break minds. Ted Kaczynski was one of the subjects of this experiment. When you think about how a weaponized version of this experiment could be easily implemented into operation mockingbird, suddenly you realize the parallels of how all media (social media and the MSM) was weaponized against the public in 2017.\\"We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.\\" -William J.

There was an air of \\"this is what true classical liberalism\\" should be and everyone appeared to buy in at the time.  I considered myself a moderate Democrat but I never told this to the people who participated in this program with me.
