Who ends up holding the bag when that happens. The majority of Americans. Foreign policy. We are expecting a war within 5 years. When has a democratic president ever shown courage to make tough decisions? Ukraine, Gaza/Israel, china/Taiwan, not a peep. And these regions are escalating. Instead of trying to say democracy is under fire, or Trump is a terrible human being, or OMG he is a convicted felon, try speaking to how you are going to fix real world issues. Harris never gave clear guidance on any issue other than social issues. And those were vague at best. Look at the stock futures market. They know what they are getting with Trump.

While I'm not happy that Trump won, I'm hoping that the Democratic Party will finally learn its lesson this time. They didn't in 2016, and they've been failing on this front ever since Carter abandoned New Deal Progressivism in favor of Neoliberal conservatism.

No one voted for a 34x felon, rapist, con man, nazi, coup attempting traitor who gave us the worst recession since the Great Depression, not even with THOSE mic fellating skills.  The only logical explanation to me is that it was rigged.  They did install a bunch of maga poll workers, who's to say that billionaires didn't figure out exactly how everything goes down and stuff it full of ballots?Let's say, hypothetically, they wanted to do it b/c they knew they'd lose if they didn't.  They use AI and all the data they steal from us to determine which of us don't vote.  They use that information to fill ballots out FOR ppl who don't vote and figured they'd need 10% more than they had in 2020.  Presto?  I don't know.  I just don't believe that there are this many traitors in our country, that's for sure.  How many times have you heard, \\"wow there used to be so many yard signs for trump around here but now I see more Harris signs!\\"  How many times have you heard, \\"XYZ was the last straw for my maga dad\\" or \\"after jan 6, my family said no more voting for trump\\"?

Even though Trump torpedoed the Border Bill, the rhetoric for years from Democrats was to allow illegal immigrants to have an easier time coming in and a path to censorship.  The recent change helped but it was too late to change people's views on Democrats.  \\n* Harris did awful during the Fox News interview.  Yes, it was a hostile interview but she should have known that going into it and had strong answers prepped.  Most of her answers were non-answers.  Given more undecided voters watch Fox than other news channels her waffling looked bad.  I understand Trump also doesn't give answers but if the goal is to show that you have good answers, while he doesn't, you need to actually have answers.  \\n* Democrats have made race, gender, and trans movements a big part of their messaging and it alienates a large part of the population.  The Trans movement does not have that much public support other than lip service and is heavily pushed back by conservatives and even moderates who have largely rejected gender neutral language terms such as they/them or Latinx.  If you need a clear example of the level of actual support the Trans movement gets, Hogwarts Legacy saw one of the largest reactions from the Trans community who attempted to get people to boycott the game and ostracize streamers who played it.  The game ended up the top selling game that year.  I'm not saying Democrats can't support those causes but they need to stop making them a central point in their messaging as it doesn't connect with the majority of Americans.  \\n* Harris is a lot like Hillary in that she isn't a politician who has held a strong stance on anything.  Her track record has shown her go back and forth a lot.  So, her campaign doesn't really have a strong platform to invigorate people.  It was mostly about not being Trump and being a rational person (which should be enough but that doesn't convince people to vote).","title":"Early election takeaways: Trump weakens Democrats coalition"},{"text":"Fuck yea","title":"Fox News just called the Election for Trump!

Anyway, Most sleep medications down regulate certain receptores in the brain.

Especially sleep medications that effect gaba receptors! Now, if you wish to treat symptoms and not the problem, thats lazy and on you. It doesnt bother me do you. Down all the pills you want. People who rely on drugs dont listen to those who warn them about the dangers of dependency, increased depression and altered brain chemistry. If I told you that 2 hours in the gym a few times a week, a constant wake schedule, Whole Foods such as eggs, steak and vegetables, along side a nice dark cold room without phones or tvs would put you to sleep you wouldnt believe me. But no thats too much work for you. Treat the symptoms because the problem will continue to get worse wether you like it or not. Your doctor runs a business you keep coming back for pills.

The doctrine required broadcasters to provide fair coverage of all sides of a public issue. It was officially abolished by the FCC in 1987.2) Permitting corporate funding of political candidates, the landmark Supreme Court case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2010 significantly changed the landscape of campaign finance in the United States. The Court ruled that corporate funding of independent political broadcasts in candidate elections cannot be limited under the First Amendment. This decision effectively allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns, leading to the rise of Super PACs (Political Action Committees).I would add a third important decision by the Supreme Court helped to chip away at democracy and pave way to autocracy.  The Court declared that a President is immune from prosecution when exercising the core powers of the presidency.

Just because I dislike trump doesnt mean all his supporters are racist.Running Biden in the first place was an utterly moronic move. Should have had a primary in the first place. I get why they didnt when Biden dropped out, but theyre idiots for getting in that situation in the first place. Ignoring the border, bringing up gun control, ignoring inflation.I make (low) six figures and I struggle to support myself and my gf who has medical issues. Theres something broken there. Ivory tower liberalism with no introspection is a huge part of why the Dems lost.

It does not matter her politics or policy, or that abortion was on the ballot. She is a woman and they don't like her. It should be mentioned there are tons of men that think the same. More so. 2. Trump provided an immediate enemy. He ran on immigrants being bad. Whether you agree or disagree it does not matter as Harris failed to provide and immediate external threat to the public (outside of Trump) and instead ran on \\"Not Going Back\\". The public is angry and is seeing everyday in their social media feeds that influencers are living lavishly and billionaires are going to space. They want a concrete enemy. The DNC has failed spectacularly in providing this while the right literally names boogey men who can be vilified by the public. 3. The media. They never took Trump seriously. Sane washed him. Add to that the largest megaphones are conservative...My biggest takeaway from this election is that we are officially in an oligarchy. We may be sliding into an illiberal democracy, but you can bet that every billionaire took notice at what Bezos, Musk, and Thiel did and they will most certainly do the same in all elections for the next generation or two.For the record I supported Harris.

There is a great history podcast series called \\"the rest is history\\" [https://www.youtube.com/@restishistorypod](https://www.youtube.com/@restishistorypod)They cover the rise of hitler rather extensively. At one point they were discussing when he sent troops into the Rhine, and no one reacted. They were noted that there was a woman who was (or whose family was) jewish. She had a solid understanding of how she was viewed by the party but she was ALL IN and excited about what was being done to restore German pride, power and lands. She was excited in spite of being aware it would be bad for her. Today one of the reporters on ABC spoke about how they interviewed a 50 year old Mexican American. He came here illegally and has since been naturalized. He was voting for Trump because he was going to do something about immigration. Talk about pulling the ladder up behind you. It doesn't matter that Trump blocked the legislation that keeps the border open so he could campaign on it. It's the fact that he's saying he's going to fix it. It doesn't matter if he's going to deport the man who just voted for him as part of his polices... He's going to vote for him cause that man does not want others to take away his opportunity. I think that it's time for a change in how democrats act. I think it's time for the party to embrace states rights, and cuts to taxes and federal services.

You don't have to think hard and understand a lot of complicated sociology and political science, you just have to accept the other is to blame because their average prosperity increased while yours didn't. Nevermind that's just trying to raise those groups to parity, does that matter when your lot isn't increasing?\\nI understand it, I think, but it doesn't make sense.

Some people may not like it, and indeed, I think what were seeing is the aftershocks of the Obama days. We nominated a black, Asian woman married to a divorced Jewish guy.

That wasnt so long ago.Kamala got asked recently why Dems sometimes offer ideas and legislature that they know wont get passed.

Rule 1 of politics - you cant do anything if you don't have power.   Unfortunately incrementalism sometimes strategically requires pressing the pause button, and even rhetorically disavowing those subjects (gay marriage anyone? ) while you quietly improve things along the margins in the background.  I think this is a hard hard pill to swallow for many people in this sub. How do Dems get away/de-emphasize from those polarizing cultural issues when they originate in the primary voters? One related advantage of the Repub electorate that I'm not sure how to instill in the Dems is they're willing to let Trump say whatever he needs to say even if it's critical or in opposition to their interests or flat out insane - something about a widely held coalition mindset that they/he needs to 'fight dirty.'Will have to wait for data but some of the demographic loses in some areas were pretty unexpected.  Could just be an anti-incumbent mentality in response to inflation vibes.  One thing I can tell you for sure is given a choice for the next recession - you're going to see much higher unemployment before any politician dare risk even mild inflation.

But not supporting it meant the ultraleftist Free Palestine protesters staying home.  Harris didn't really lend support to either side (i.e. Israel OR Palestine), which drove a lot of Israel supporters to Trump who's unequivocably pro-Israel, but didn't give good a good reason for pro-Palestine people to vote for her.People are also tired of being told how to vote.  \\"If you're a woman, vote Harris.
