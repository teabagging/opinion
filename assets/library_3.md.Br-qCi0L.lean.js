Universal healthcare is not the only solution. In my opinion, it's not even close to being the best solution. I don't like our system anymore than you do, but I very much disagree that your solution is going to make it better. Our system currently disadvantages people who don't have a lot of money. If Europe can be any example, your system will disadvantage everyone except people who have obscene amounts of money and can just pay for whatever they want in another country. I don't see that as being better.but why is America simply more right-wing than other Western countries?That's actually a very easy question to answer. America is full of the ancestors of people who were crazy enough to cross oceans to come to a young country with in order to make a name for themselves. Those type of people are going to be the type of people who have the belief that you should take care of yourself and make your own way, not rely on government.pointed out the inability of skilled workers to easily join the country has a direct, measurable impact on GDP,And he was lying. The reason they want to bring in those high skilled workers is to drive down wages amongst postgraduate academics. The reason they want to bring in unskilled labor is to drive down wages amongst the working poor. It has nothing to do with the output of the economy, it has everything to do with who gets the spoils of the current economy.Everyone would benefit from changing this, right?Absolutely not. The size of the economic pie doesn't matter if only a few people get to determine how that pie is cut up. A smaller, more equitable pie will be better off for everyone than a larger pie that is controlled by oligarchs and the government.I don't see how they could possibly have *that much power* as to control and block what is a fundamental role of government in other countiresWhy should the government be involved at all? They have proven without any doubt that they're not very good at managing stuff. Why not just write a bunch of rules and set a bunch of punishments for bad behavior from hospitals and insurance companies and let the market figure it out? A market solution will be vastly superior than universal healthcare. The problem is, despite what many people think, we do not have a market solution in this country. And we don't, specifically, because of the laws that the government has passed interfering with that market and not allowing it to effectively function.","title":"CMV: It would benefit Republcians to just... stop being evil."},{"text":"I mean, they thought Haitian immigrants were eating cats and dogs.

Unless you think *our* tariffs on Mexican goods are going to be paid by Mexico.If many people want manufacturing tooling, and its too expensive because of tariffs, what would you say is a good domestic investment? (hint: tooling manufacturing).Finally, your arguments dont rely on the size of the tariffs, which is incredibly important. Youre absolutely right about what will happen with a 0.01% tariff.On the other hand, a 1000% tariff is making domestic producers the only option. Itd destroy our economy, but itd make domestic companies FAR more competitive (if their COGS is less than 10X a foreign producers), as well as driving MASSIVE investment (if they think the tariffs will stick).Anything between those figures will have a mix of effects, including making domestic companies more competitive (at the cost of retaliatory tariffs, increased prices, etc, etctariffs suck, but denying the small upside is silly).","title":"Trump is threatening new tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico.

An updated civil rights act that includes the right to bodily autonomy, LGBTQ+ rights, etc.4.  Increased background checks when purchasing guns.5.  Aggressive trust busting.6. Passing the John Lewis Voting act. We also need to end citizens united. Supreme court reform.7. More pro-worker policies like raising the minimum wage. The right to join a union, investments in bringing green tech manufacturing jobs back stateside.8. Updating CAFE standards to close the work truck loophole. The reason why cars are and trucks are getting so huge is because they get emissions exemptions if they are classified as a work truck. We want smaller, more efficient, cars. At the same time, the car enthusiast in me wants to ensure that regulations don't kill sports cars or cars with manual transmissions.

The general answer is my own moral framework and values which I believe are more important than material wealth.The linked article talks about restricting credit card companies interest rates to ten percent which I think is a great idea. It's not so much that I want to \\"give people less choice\\" but I want to prevent companies from exploiting individuals who are in such a precarious situation that they'd carry credit card debt with a 30% instead rate. That's immoral. And yes, I am fine with removing that \\"choice\\" from the table.Other replies in this thread mention things like \\"forcing companies to bring back the jobs which have been shipped overseas\\" due to globalism. Again, I support this because it's immoral to take a job paying say 100k/yr here and have it performed in another country for 10k/yr even if the foreign worker is ecstatic about making that wage. This is exploiting the poor economic condition in that foreign worker's country while also destroying the life of the worker here. There's also an aspect of \\"anything we're not willing to make ourselves and pay our own people a living wage to make WE DON'T DESERVE TO HAVE.\\" There are some exceptions, of course, such as goods which cannot be produced here for a hard reason... like \\"this fruit won't grow here.\\"The fact that policies such as this will reduce overall wealth and consumption is another bonus. I'm a degrowth advocate mainly out of environmental concerns but also because I think there are too many damned people on the earth and I hate human beings. I'd like to see maybe 500 million total humans globally. I'm also a total redistribution / equality of outcome style socialist... not the \\"workers own the means of production\\" type which I am well aware of the definition of \\"real socialism.\\" IMO this doesn't actually reduce choice at all. If outcomes (i.e. how much money you get) is completely divorced from the work you perform then your choices are endless. Don't want to work or to just do jack-shit? Want to be a doctor? Want to be a painter? Just do it. It won't change a thing about the material conditions of your life?Is this economically efficient? Absolutely not. Who will do the dirty jobs that no one wants to do? I dunno, maybe no one. The goal isn't an efficiently running economy, society, community, etc. The system may not even function at all. The goal is to maximize the agency of every individual to act however they please without those choices impacting their material conditions. Economic socialism married to libertarian individualism.","title":"Republican Populism Aims To Expand the Nanny State"},{"text":"No, no it did not.  Ukraine never attacked Russia.

In fact, the omnicompetent, sovereign citizen found in the influential writings of Robert Dahl and Walt Whitman is an unattainable myth: voters are incapable and uninterested in fulfilling the role required of them by democracy. Most people are too busy with jobs and families to give politics sufficient attention: rather than spending their leisure time studying the minutiae of trade deals or infrastructure planning, they, quite understandably, pursue more enjoyable pastimes.?Even the minority of voters that have the time and inclination to inform themselves about politics do not behave as folk theory contends. When faced with choice in a democracy, human judgement is overwhelmed by the complexity of the world and bent by self-interest. Voters use information not to challenge their own opinions but to rationalise them, which the authors describe as enhanced bias.

Humans exist in a neutral state until they are happened upon and must make a choice. Whether or not it was a morally good or morally bad choice, it does not typically assume the entirety of one's character going forward.  A few good choices, followed by a few bad choices, followed by a mix of both. It's all circumstantial - the scale of whether or not someone is bad or good can fluccuate wildly, and is highly dependent on ones access to opportunities of making impactful choices in the first place.Additionally,  most people believe they are making the best most correct choice for themselves and others. Which is why it is so hard to break through at times, and have them see they were mistaken. As the \\"bad\\" choice genuinely seemed like the 'good' choice from their POV. Whether you were raised in a cult, or on a navel base, or in a trailer park, or a ghetto, or Beverly Hills, wherever....you never needed a book to tell you what was good or bad, because you have empathy, which means you are capable of compassion. The ability to see through the eyes of those impacted by your actions, the inclination to anticipate their reactions based on how you would feel in their situation...should be all you need to know whether or not what you're doing is \\"bad\\". Even so, choosing to ignore those human traits and become apathetic to those around you, even then, choosing the \\"bad\\" choice doesn't make you a bad person. It just makes you someone who is inherently disconnected from humanity. If life's done its worst and you truly believe there is no hope for us, then looking out for yourself and and only yourself wouldn't make you a bad person. It would just make you someone who was doing their best to end whatever suffering you were experiencing at the time. After some time passes maybe you're in a better spot physically and mentally, maybe then you start making the good choices. It's all circumstantial.  That's why nothing is ever too late, you can always choose to be better.","title":"CMV: a good person is a person who does good things, whatever tools they use to do that"},{"text":"The Moderators are very Leftist.","title":"With regards to people getting banned on libtard subs....."},{"text":"\\"Provoked by decades of american politics\\"?

All Trump cares about is maximizing power and wealth for himself, and running as a Republican just happened to be the most expedient way of accomplishing this. Even his success at manipulating people is not the result of intelligence, its just who he is. Hes a narcissist. Manipulation comes naturally to him.

That question is \\"If you don't believe in god/an afterlife what is stopping you from raping and killing all the people you want to? Why aren't you a terrible person?\\"Hence the answer \\"if you need the threat of eternal punishment to be a good person you are not a good person\\" Because theists who ask that question quite frankly aren't thinking it through. That question carries with it an implicit confession to their worldview. That is \\"God is the only reason doing good is worth doing.\\" Which is horrific. Now to their credit most people who ask this question when talked through why it's a really stupid one. You can do good for no reason other than wanting to make the world better. So back to the phrase. Basically it's not talking about people who want to be good for its own sake. It is speaking explicitly to these people who blatantly confess that if God/the law/punishment wasn't a factor, there would be no reason to be good. That person is telling on themselves that the only reason they act good is fear and that, deprived of that fear they would want to be a bad person. That's not a good person to me.

U.S. oil refining capacity stood at 18.4 million barrels per day (b/d) as of January 1, 2024. In 2023, 60% of U.S. crude oil imports originated in Canada, up from 33% in 2013. [] Crude oil production averaged 4.6 million b/d in Canada during 2023, nearly three times the countrys 1.7 million-b/d refinery capacity. Many U.S. refineries are designed to handle heavy oils like those produced in Canadas oil sands, yielding refined products such as transportation fuels (gasoline and diesel), chemicals, and plastics.That says the US has over 10 times more refinery capacity than Canada. It also says that most of the USs oil imports come from Canada, but not 98%. As far as I can tell, the 60% figure only accounts for imports. I dont think it includes domestically produced oil.  Im not trying to be a jerk. You clearly know more about this than I do.

There are barely any Arabs or Muslims in the U.S., the opposition was largely multiracial but it wasn't large enough and most of the protestors weren't affected by the war.But 1/5th of Americans are Latino and more than half of Latinos in the U.S. are Mexican. Entire swathes of border states are majority Mexican-American, in many places enough to feel like you're in Mexico. These people have family in Mexico.\\n \\nInvading Mexico would spark an ethnic conflict in the U.S., with Mexican-Americans in majority Mexican areas of Texas, Arizona, California, etc. demanding their lands be given to Mexico (and they would have a good argument since these lands were annexed by the U.S. in the first place) and many would probably fight back against U.S. military. The U.S. would be facing off both the Mexican military and an insurgency spearheaded by the cartels and local resistance groups in both countries.The entirety of Latin America would unite against the U.S., at least politically (except for that bootlicker Milei) and some countries may even send troops and weapons to Mexico. China might arm Mexico to test out untested weapons, the way many Western countries did with Ukraine.You could even see the Miami area try to secede. If Latinos don't feel respected or wanted in this country, why be a part of it? As a Latino myself I've thought about this. If we survive Trump and he eventually leaves office and we start getting normal non-racist/non-fascist presidents again, we'll be fine. But if we start to feel like we won't ever be accepted by the U.S. (like say if Vance or a future Republican president continued the war or invaded another Latin country), that we will always be considered perpetual foreigners in this country, that this country hates us, etc., then we will lose hope in the idea of the inclusive American Dream. We may even start to think it was bullshit all along. That type of thinking may become more common with Latinos if he invades Mexico, and to some extent I'm already seeing it, and I can't blame them. A similar thing happens with Arab/Muslim-Americans who witness what the U.S. does in the Middle East (invading Iraq, supporting Israel's genocide of Palestinians, etc.) and many of them are radicalized into essentialist anti-American ideas (understandably so) because of it. In some cases, radicalized into Islamism or pan-Arab Baathism.A similar phenomena would happen with Latino youth (well, it kinda already did with the Chicano movement in the 60s, but this would be Chicano movement on steroids and other Latino ethnicities would join in, and there would be more violence). And instead of being radicalized into Islamism, they'd be radicalized into some kind of pan-Hispanic Chavismo or Fidelismo type of leftist anti-imperialism.

Plus which side refinement happens would likely be a factor as well. The fact is though this is not actually very accurate because a 25% tariff on export is going to do more than just add 25% of wholesale to gas prices because.1. The Tariff is paid for by the importer lets say that is $0.20\\n2. The Gas is then resold either to distribution companies or refineries at this point it is not an additional $0.20 that is paid because the importer has to make profit and isn't going to reduce their gross margin so if we applied the standard rule of 3 the $0.20 they pay costs the next down the line $0.60\\n3. This is then sold again to the gas stations who apply the same markup so in theory $0.20 in import tariffs could cost $1.80 by the time it has made it's way to the pumps.All of these figures are as an example of the math only not actual costs but you can see the issue even a relatively small tariff can have.It is also unlikely to lead to domestic suppliers being used over imported gas because domestic suppliers now have an excuse to raise gas prices themselves in line with the import cost rise but without having to pay the tariffs so they can just make more profit instead. These companies are far better off making more profit and using that to acquire entire foreign suppliers instead of cutting consumers a break.not to mention that any rise in gas prices means the cost to transport anything also goes up and the USA run's on road haulage","title":"Gas prices will rise as much as 15c/gal to 75c/gal mostly in states won by Trump if he applies a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports"},{"text":"Ah, TIL!

Natural Law is clear enough to allow non-believers to morally get a lot of things right. Also, using external motivators like fear of punishment can be good to shape behavior, especially in certain contexts or stages of moral development. However, true moral maturity requires people to internalize the wrongness of harmful actions. If morality remains external and relies on fear or social pressure, it risks collapsing when those forces weaken or disappear. Ideally, people should develop a personal sense of ethics that sustains them regardless of external circumstances.","title":"CMV: a good person is a person who does good things, whatever tools they use to do that"},{"text":"God youre 100% correct","title":"Why one veteran economist is doubling down on his 2025 recession call after Trump's victory"},{"text":"Anything that cuts down on fossil fuel usage is a good thing.So what if the Lardmericans have to cut down on their food intake.","title":"Canadas oil patch rattled by Trump's tariff threat"},{"text":"you believe in the Constitution my ass.

Trump was the worst possible choice for President and now we'll all pay for it.","title":"Trump-MAGA Rage at Mexico Suddenly Takes Dark Turn: \\"Pain Will Ensue\\""},{"text":"As others have said, oil is a global commodity. Prices for crude oil are set by supply and demand, and involves many factors, making it much more complex than drill baby drill. Oil and natural gas companies are capital constrained, meaning they have to select a few projects from a larger portfolio of possible projects. And they do that based on their own analysis of risk and profitability for each project.If the perception of the future is that prices are going down, there will be a retraction in the capital markets and a reduction in drilling. In our system, we cannot force upstream companies (those that own mineral rights that allow them to drill) to drill wells. If drilling goes down in response to a perceived downturn in prices, then that starts a chain reaction through the entire services sector, from drilling to fracturing to production to even wellsite catering. People will lose their jobs. Oil companies like predictability and stability. And while the federal government could potentially incentivize leasing and drilling with policy, they cannot make anyone drill wells. Trumps Treasury Sec nominee, Scott Bessent, wants to increase US production by 3 MM bbls per day. That is a 22% increase over the 13.5 MM bbls per day we produce now. Its also a 3% increase in global production. Do you think the other world-wide producers will happily give up market share to make room for the additional 3 MM bbls per day coming from the US? Enter the price war. And that is destabilizing. Refer to my comment above this paragraph.And renewables like wind, solar, hydro and nuclear can impact the entire energy production and consumption landscape. In Texas, almost half of the electricity generation is from solar, wind and nuclear. Wind is about 25% of the total. This will only grow and expand throughout North America. And while it is true that Texas does not derive any electricity generation from burning oil, the source of electricity generation points to a market-driven approach that could well reduce demand for fossil fuels.What does make sense is that the US is blessed with an abundance of natural gas and oil. And we could become a big player in the global energy markets by becoming an energy exporter. We are a net energy exporter right now. But for natural gas, that means LNG export terminals, which cost tens of billions to build and years of planning. This would translate into jobs in the construction, operating and maintenance of these terminals, so theres that. But, the risks are an oversupply of LNG on the world market that depresses prices. And if are thinking of building an LNG terminal today, it may be 5+ years before its operational. And who can confidently predict LNG prices 5+ years out to decide today whether to proceed. Its tough, and takes massive amounts of capital and risk.","title":"Donald Trumps call for energy dominance is likely to run into real-world limits"},{"text":"If you've been paying attention this year, it's a thing.","title":"Trump-MAGA Rage at Mexico Suddenly Takes Dark Turn: \\"Pain Will Ensue\\""},{"text":"Fuck I not not lol.","title":"Why one veteran economist is doubling down on his 2025 recession call after Trump's victory"},{"text":"You think he doesnt know?

How many posts per day do you think there are? Idk let's say 1000 (less than 1% active posts. A well moderated sub should have either automated or manual ways of reviewing all 1000 posts. Because if you don't you're going to spammed with porn ads, botting, off topic stuff and the experience of your community goes down and people will be mad. Get bad enough and reddit may *remove it* (can't have the brand looking bad amirite). That takes active effort. So rules need to be 1) clear (written and obvious so people can follow them), 2) simple (so people can follow them and they can be easily enforced, remember a 1000 posts a day can't spend too much time on nuance), 3) at least superficially reasonable (so people agree to follow them and still stick around.)This doesn't even take into account the comment section. Oh God I don't even want to know the kind of horror mods have to go through on larger subs in the comments section. So, in my view, this is a non zero amount of effort. This doesn't even incorporate the hate directly targeted at them *just for being mods* some of whom probably are just trying to equitably apply rules they didn't invent. What do mods get in return? Money? What is this? Some socialist utopia? No. Daddy reddit has venture capitalists to pay back. \\"For the community\\" and all that you hear /u/spez whisper in your ear, all the while his doughy/pasty white hands shove piles of cash into some yacht manufacturers coffers.  So you do it for *the love of the game*. You have to either be emotionally invested in 1) the topic, 2) the community, 3) enforcing rules/power. Preferably all three, but just one would do. In essence being a mod selects for the most ingested and I'm sure you can imagine a topic or a space in which you are emotionally invested or over invested. Do you always act \\"rationally\\" or \\"fairly\\" in those spaces? Of course not. Imagine if someone starts insulting your friend or significant other to your face, you don't go \\"oh, that's impolite but it is your right to express yourself.\\" You might throw hands. People expect mods to impartially follow rules but this is something they have to (and I'm generalizing here) love or want to do (with their free time) so...Tl;dr: mods of large subs do a lot of (potentially traumatizing work) for no money and as a result require a degree of emotional investment which by nature limits impartiality. Unless reddit wants to do profit sharing and pay mods that's how it gonna be. And reddit got VC firms to payback, users to monitize, and ads to sell.

There have to be standards even for homeschooling and private schools so at the very least kids can make informed choices about if they want to follow a religion. simply refusing to allow the children to miss school for religious reasons on important holidaysThis is one of the reasonable exemptions I was talking about.

If I show you my cross necklace and say 'my religion makes my life so much easier', is that conversion? It's definitely part of conversion... Would the other person be able to call cops and tell them they were attempts at conversion? Could I then object? Without a clear differentiation, anything can be regarded as conversion. Seeing 4 people with cross necklaces while being the fifth without one means there is social pressure to join the norm, is that conversion? What if that was their specific intent?My point is that this is impossible. You cannot outlaw conversion while allowing religious expression without drawing a hard line between those two where there currently is no line at all. When I'm talking about converting people in private, I mean strangers coming up to you.I don't understand, isn't 'meeting stangers' inherently public? Am I meeting strangers inside my own private house?Also, if public turns into private when you're talking one-on-one with a stranger, does that mean I can wear my 'be religious' shirt in public without issue, but I have to hide it as soon as someone approaches me one-on-one? It's okay to talk about the advantages of your religious to a group (public) but if too many people leave it becomes wrong because it turns into a private setting?For instance, when you enroll in a university, a lot of them make you sign a form that you've gotten certain vaccinations. Staying home doesn't make sense because vaccinations are about preventing disease, not what you do once you get it.I was talking about covid vaccines, I should've mentioned. Many employers didn't *require* vaccines in general, they only required vaccines in order to enter the building. Staying home isn't a method of dealing with *being* sick in this example, it's a method of dealing with not getting vaccines. This example doesn't work unless it's about a temporary disease epidemic like covid, not so much the continuous vaccines like polio, on that topic I do agree with you.","title":"CMV: Freedom of religion should be a way narrower right."},{"text":"life coaching... it's a social activity.

Im also specifically approaching it from the US Constitutions right to freedom of religion.The first thing to keep in mind there is that the right is narrower. It does not exempt religious followers from following laws that apply to everyone else with some very narrow exceptions (e.g., the government cant interfere with who a religion chooses for its clergy). Instead, that Constitutional right is supplemented by statutes that call for accommodation. Some of that accommodation you mentioned, but other things well-accepted are things like conscientious objectors. Theres a catch-all law called RFRA, which was created because people who used peyote for religious practices were being prosecuted because the generally applicable law made it illegal.Im also going to push back on a couple of your things that shouldnt be included:1. The right to convert someone is a free speech right, not a religious freedom right. Even then, it isnt so broad that people cant kick you out of their home. 2. Tax exemptions arent inherently a religious freedom right. Instead, they are applied to non-profits in general. The salaries of the pastor, etc. are still taxed. Some places dont exempt non-profits but the rule should be consistent between religious non-profits and non-religious ones.3. This also isnt technically a freedom of religion thing, its a parental rights thing. The line of cases that started this go back to a case where a state banned children from being taught German even on their own time because of prejudice against German immigrants. The next case was about the right to send Catholic children to Catholic school.","title":"CMV: Freedom of religion should be a way narrower right."},{"text":"He is the man who laid down in parliament so that when you google lying in parliament you got endless articles of him spawled across parliamentary branches instead off him doing what he usually does: lying in parliament.

The problem with a public setting is that everybody's generally allowed to be there, including people trying to proselytize, so in order to kick them out for it you have to get some kind of special ruling. In a private setting, on somebody's private property, they get to decide who is welcome and who isn't, and what behavior they'll tolerate from the people they allow in.  So if somebody is being annoying about their religion, you can just tell them to go away, and their \\"freedom of religion\\" doesn't mean they get to stay and keep annoying you.What about this current arrangement do you want changed? Do you think it shouldn't be up to the property owner whether or not people are allowed to proselytize there? Do you think it should be *forbidden* in some way to attempt to convince people to join your religion in a private setting?other practices involving children should not be guaranteed (although not necessarily illegal).So if, say, Jewish people no longer have the protected right to raise their children in the Jewish faith, that means it's now legally acceptable for the government to start interfering and preventing their children from learning or participating in their cultural heritage. Via various legal methods of separating parents and children, from boarding schools and removed custody, to simply refusing to allow the children to miss school for religious reasons on important holidays, you prevent Jewish beliefs, culture, and tradition from being passed to the next generation.

In this scenario I can even see businesses doing quite well specially with tax cuts maybe encouraging investment in growth again rather than this cut throat show profits or die sort of wall street we've seen the last two-three years that's encouraged layoffs. We'd probably come out fineBut I don't believe it. Tariffs and deportations were the only two issues he had true conviction in during the campaign. I have *some* hope he'll either be stopped or stop quickly with the tariffs when he is told or forced to realize how absolutely mind numbingly stupid blanket tariffs are but he also is surrounded by enablers that I doubt question anything he does, and it might take an implementation of the tariffs that causes a quick and swift, hopefully temporary economic downturn that has the potential to snowball because I don't think we have near as strong foundations of the economy as we did a few years ago. We'll see.But even moreso I feel stronger that you're wrong on immigration. They seem to have more conviction than ever on that and I think we see him gone *way* further than any US president has ever gone, and that'll cause it's own economic issues too. I'm even worried he will go as far to weaponize it to deport people he doesn't like. The guy he appointed over all that is a purist who would absolutely get behind it all. There's no adults in the room as there was in 2017. I don't know that he gets Congress on board with the slim majority but they are already cooking up ways to do it sans Congress by re-allocating money. I'm worried this will be a bigger deal than any of us imagine. The other big thing is if there's some sort of major event or conflict during his presidency, he's so inept that he won't be able to deal with it well just like Covid\\n He was extremely lucky first term as far as that goes besides Covid which he absolutely fumbled. That all worries me a lot. Not to mention his response to the two major current conflicts will be leagues worse. I'm also worried that first big protest that happens under him he will find a way to violently respond and that could brew up a lot of unrest. The court gave him too much power with the immunity ruling.

It would be entirely up to America as to whether to enforce these trade regulations while providing tax-free trading, potentially making the US a huge investment opportunity, even for those countries privileged enough to join a Eurasian global trade BRIC/BLOC. Corporations which operate multi-nationally yet have been restricted by sanctions - IF Elon succeeds at removing those regulatory committees and restrictions - would benefit massively from this. Providing US Citizens with quantity over quality in terms of goods while providing the opportunity for investors to become potential stakeholders in America. Countries like Britain, whose media heavily criticizes this decision, would suffer massively as they and every other nation that cannot leverage their economy on output production. The US would no longer be obliged to trade or provide cheap goods while taking their investors. The only thing that Trump and Elon need to do now is introduce a social-credit-score-system for those in America in more debt then they can afford and increase energy production to offset rising costs. So long as employment increases by 2% and there's a 2% increase in efficiency or innovation they'd meet the minimum requirements to pay back China's debt - once the global fiat monetary system has collapsed. They're doing exactly what America needs to do, cutting out corrupt globalists and being selective of those allowed to operate within America. Europe would be better following these measures also in my opinion and focusing on our own industries and output production without need of continued global investments, especially those linked to global financial corruption.","title":"How to persuade Donald Trump that tariffs would Make America Weak Again?"},{"text":"Ok.

It is a respectable roll in our kind of society that not just anyone with any sort of mindset, and mentality can manage while keeping their sanity, and self respect.  Society has rules we all follow, and rules are good. On that note though, it is my opinion that a lil chaos mixed in can be good too.

As America's economy took off, car ownership exploded. Eisenhower imposed a limit on oil imports in hopes of avoiding dependence on foreign oil, but by the time his VP Nixon entered office in 1969, US oil production was maxed out. Of course, Nixon's scandals destroyed the GOP, and the people elected our last liberal POTUS, Carter. But just before Carter took office, Nixon enacted blatantly Marxist price caps and ended the restriction on foreign oil, opening the US to dependence on oil from the Middle East, then also unpegged the dollar from the price of gold, which caused Middle East oil producer real profits to fall as they adjusted to the free floating dollar. At this time, Saudi Arabia saw a chance to push back against the West's continued military and economic expansion by enacting a oil embargo - another piece of economic leverage readily available to them - on top of Egypt's existing blockade of the Suez Canal and the October War. Israel's military had so dominated the Six-Day War, the Arab states could not be blamed for viewing Israel as a threat to the continued existence of their governments. But Nixon saw the USSR providing aid to Egypt and SA, so the Cold War compelled him to continue supporting Israel with weapons shipments, not to mention the hope of distracting the American public from Watergate. The Arab states had been hoping to convince Nixon to make Israel return the territory they'd taken. Instead, he cemented their hatred of the West. Kissinger even started planning a full invasion of Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, and SA, until the Saudis threatened to burn their own oil fields. Eventually, they only ended the embargo after seeing massive dollar inflation wrecking their own US bank accounts.The blame for all these conditions coming together and landing on Carter as he entered the White House meant that the American people associated any and all leftist policies with long lines at gas pumps for meager rations, like the commies standing around in bread lines, even though Nixon imposed price controls on oil, and Carter removed them. We had won the war - we shouldn't have to be waiting around for rations like embarrassed losers. Thus, the voters were happy to let a Middle East CIA oilman and the corporate raiders lead Reagan's pro-business agenda, including expansion of domestic oil production, and cutting taxes and regulations.As older people tend to vote more, they remembered these times when voting in the 90s, so even the Democrats were looking for a more pro-business candidate. Most of the liberal primary candidates dropped out fairly early. Jerry Brown fucked up by floating Jesse Jackson for VP after Jackson had offended Jewish voters. Clinton boasted of his \\"triangulation\\", meaning adopting conservative policy positions. His victory showed the success of a shift to the right. Meanwhile, Nixon's old team was building Fox News, defending the Iran-Contra players, working with foreign dictators, and laying the foundation for today's GOP with the Tea Party and the openly fascist cult we're dealing with today.","title":"Trumps Fans Suddenly Realize How He Picks Nomineesand Theyre Pissed"},{"text":"Real patriots call out their own country's flaws and take examples from others on how to improve if necessary.","title":"Mexican president denies country is closing border despite Trump claims"},{"text":"Hasan got kicked out of the DNC this year for saying things like\\"I care about labor, anti-war, free healthcare and college for all.

Is this a problem with the definition of marriage and bachelor? Definitions are interesting. This paradox exists because of?**strict definitions**, not because such a state is inherently impossible across all conceivable realities.Consider the following definition label for the set of impossible things, like what you've said:* Irrefutably impossible: { \\"a married bachelor\\" }\\n* (Future) potential reality: { \\"personal death\\" }\\n* (Past) realized: { \\"not a virgin\\", \\"inventing the light bulb\\" }We could argue that back then, as an example, \\"inventing the light bulb\\" was irrefutably possible -- at least to human knowledge back then.* Irrefutably impossible: { \\"a married bachelor\\", \\"inventing the light bulb\\" }\\n* (Future) potential reality: { \\"personal death\\" }\\n* (Past) realized: { \\"not a virgin\\" }But you and I both know that's not true, presently at least, because it had happened.Wait a second, how did we move an element from the seemingly \\"Irrefutably impossible\\" to (Past) realized? I thought it was impossible? Or so, the people before the invention of light thought it was impossible...We have two options to resolve this:1. Refactor the label of \\"Irrefutably impossible\\" to add additional conditions to adapt/accurately to our real-world model understanding; or\\n2. Remove the label, because illustrated that some elements in the irrefutably impossible are not actually impossible.If we refactor the label, what could that label be? \\"Irrefutably impossible, on planet earth -- limited to our current understanding\\" ? That would suggest that just because we don't understand something, doesn't mean it is not real or has potential be real.If we remove the label of \\"irrefutably impossible\\", then that means anything that we can conceive with our minds thus far has to go into either two sets:* (Future) potential reality: { ... }\\n* (Past) realized: { ... }This includes your seemingly impossible thought: \\"A married bachelor\\".\\\\--All this to say, to answer your question, if *alternative* worlds somewhere somehow exist, with different governing laws and rules of logic, then maybe these superposition do exist. Currently, as of 20241128, we are aware of quantum scale physics: how it's possible to hold two states at once. We didn't know this \\"Quantum\\" and \\"world\\" existed before, but now we do. And because we do know it now, we can improve our understanding.Thus, to answer your question even more precisely, simply put: I can't pinpoint that exact world for you in which \\"a married bachelor\\" exists, or is true. But if this fun thought experiment and very provisional draft hypothesis with pure speculation and no empirical evidence suggests thoughts have inherent potential realities, then *somewhere, somehow*, it exists out there.EDIT: I would add that \\"a married bachelor\\" may fit in the (Future) or (Past). We don't know if that concept exists back then in some world. Or maybe, someone decides to wear a sign saying, \\"Bachelor\\", at a wedding as the groom -- would that make the thought a reality?

So it's easy to hook people who are vaguely dissatisfied with the state of the world, convince them that the establishment (government, media, academia, medicine, political correctness, whatever) is the problem, and present right-wing ideas as anti-establishment.  Even the non-political episodes prime listeners to feel more open to the political content.","title":"After Trump wins the influencer election, why some Democrats want to create their own Joe Rogan"},{"text":"We've already seen Trump isn't held accountable for anything.

No, it's more about wanting to control his base and win their favor through Trump. As for not convicting him in 2021, like I said, they want his base to vote for them, so they let him slide. They believed that was the end of Trump and that no one would ever vote for him again or that he'd end up in prison. When it became clear that the system wasn't going to clean up their mess for them, they had to jump back into the cesspool with Trump. True, they SHOULD have convicted him in 2021, but the GOP is shortsighted, ignorant and lazy. They had a chance to get him from around their necks, but now they are shackled to him as long as he draws breath. However, should Trump kill or harm anyone, especially a political figure, that's a road they won't go down for one reason and one reason only: if he did it to an opponent, he'll do it to them too and they have no idea of knowing what will or won't trigger him. Safest best is to remove him from power and try to save what little face they can with the public. The public really won't be lulled into acceptance. This isn't Russia where killing of political opponents has been commonplace for nearly 100 years now. There's no taste for it here and it won't be tolerated. Plus, the media will SWARM on it like piranha to a piece of meat. It'll be EVERYWHERE with 24/7 coverage. The media giants go where the wind blows and the second Trump goes killer on opponents, the feeding frenzy will begin.

They didn't though because it would violate the constitution and cause chaos.See, Trump doesn't *control* the SCOTUS. He's protected by them, but when it comes to him telling them what to do, they will ignore him. Why? They don't need him, he doesn't finance him and they sure as hell don't respect him. Here's the problem as to why Trump got away with not being branded an insurrectionist; Clause 3 of the 14th amendment is too vague on key issues:\\\\#1. Who determines if someone is guilty of insurrection?\\\\#2. Who enforces the decision of someone being an insurrectionist?\\\\#3. What determines if someone is an insurrectionist?The ruling of the SCOTUS is that an individual state cannot determine if someone is an insurrectionist. If they can, then say if in a future election a democrat is running, and the state of Mississippi decides to kick them off of the ballot because they believe that person is an insurrectionist, and they convince a bunch of other red states to do the same. It would cause election chaos as you'd have states kicking candidates off of ballots on made up insurrection claims. Basically, while Clause 3 of the 14th amendment is well meaning, it's inherently broken as it lacks key defining parameters by which someone can be held accountable as an insurrectionist. So, when people cite Trump's case about not being held accountable as an insurrectionist, it's not because the SCOTUS is in Trump's pocket, it's because the clause is broken and is, technically, unenforceable and too open to abuse in its current state. You would have literally had Red states kicking Joe Biden off of the ballot because their judges said he was an insurrectionist while blue states would have kicked Trump off because their judges said he was an insurrectionist with no national consensus as to which one actually was because no grounds for determining and executing such a judgement had been defined.

As an organizer in a swing state that flipped red I think that had we not tailored our message to different groups or tried to appeal to the entire coalition, wed have lost in a wipeout landslide like 1980.Messaging is obviously not our only path to success but it always plays a role and can be improved. Theres always a new angle to consider and Im sure that there are some very highly paid staff working on it as we speak. And dealing with the right wing misogynist media environment is a part of what we have to deal with when it comes to messaging.I think that the media environment is not so much an amplifier as it is like a radio or tv broadcast in that it can be hijacked or metaphorically modified to amplify the opposite of the intended point. Right wingers do this all the time when they do stuff like, when Obama talks about a public option he really means death panels. The right wing media at the time amplified it but the code stuck even when Democrats talked about it and the reactionary messaging set up the crushing defeat of 2010.Like it wasnt something that should be the basis for a campaign, but calling culture war Republican talking points weird would be a good way that this can be countered. Trump is immune to it because he ironically avoids new types of crazy and is just the same type of crazy he has always been, albeit amplified. But if we used it on Ron Florida is where woke goes to die Desantis, his buzzwordy and more shrill type of crazy would be seen as weird by the American public even when he had the spotlight on him.Maybe the media environment can be turned against someone in addition to refined tailoring, as defining a candidate or a policy is often the most important step of mounting a decent defense or attack.Just some extra thoughts.","title":"Daily Discussion Thread: November 28, 2024"},{"text":"Try being Americas neighbour in Canada or Mexico.","title":"Who's side is Trump on?"},{"text":"In comparison to who?

I agree with you that we must keep hope as some appear to vote against their interests or get swayed to the other side, but please recognize that these people are doing something common and natural, and while you are allowed to view them as annoying, we can develop ways to appeal to them.The field of rhetoric, communication, and messaging is so vast that our culture has barely scratched the surface of what is possible and how to appeal to people.

Do we work with the societal bias against female-coded traits and ideas among certain voters, or try to change it?  I know it's not quite so simple, but look at it that way for a moment.To be clear, I think we absolutely need to continue to have policies that appeal to blue-collar men, and it's always smart to tailor your message to your audience.  There's an inherent weakness in the idea that if we just use the right messaging we'll be OK, though.Let's say the next Dem candidate for President does this perfectly.  They have the best, sharpest, most dude-friendly message imaginable, and use it at every factory in the Rust Belt.Imagine for a second that you're a GOP strategist tasked with defeating this Democrat.  What would you do?To me, it's pretty simple - go on all the shows, go to a bunch of rallies, and just lay on the Trump-style rhetoric.  Play up how manly and tough you are, and talk about how Dems do nothing but talk about gender and identity politics.  Do you think it'd work?  I do!  Because there's already a huge apparatus to send that lie all over the place, and no messaging can break through that.  My proof of this is pretty simple: Harris and Walz already did exactly what you're proposing, and look at what happened.So while you're right that we've got to modify our message for our audience, that's not enough.  Because Republicans already have a warehouse of bullshit they can keep going back to.  See Episode 3 for more details on this.You're right, but we also have to do the hard work.  We've got to question the ideas that lead to bias against women, and help the guys in our lives question them as well.  It's slow as hell, but it really does work if you do it in the context of a real relationship.

Sure, you could throw in \\"have access to birth control and abortions\\", but it doesn't even really come down to that, because we see exceptions where those things don't matter.If you run a simple scatter plot of \\"gender inequality vs fertility rate\\", you will find strong correlation (R squared is 0.64 in the data I looked at) with almost no exception. Any demographic or nation with a [gender inequality index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Inequality_Index) below 0.2 does _not_ reproduce itself. Doesn't matter what men do, doesn't matter what men or women think.Actually, there were two exceptions in the data set, so I'll just mention them. Israel and Kazakhstan. Israel's birthrate is supported by its fundamentalist Haredi population as well as an ideology that believes it must reproduce in order to survive (due to constant threat of war on all sides). I can't speak for Kazakhstan, but it's probably a blip on the radar before their women stop having kids too.This was a known problem in the ancient world. Civilizations that allowed women to inherit money and land from their dead husbands were doomed for collapse. This happened in Ancient Sparta, for instance.So, let's be crystal clear: you don't need to \\"fix\\" gender ideology in order to change the material circumstances of birth rates. You need to change the material circumstances of women, who will then have different incentives, and birth rates could then go up. This trend is not directly driven by ideology. The only ideology at play is the indirect drive for women to start their adult lives by becoming educated and pursuing a career. That's what needs to change.","title":"One of the ultimate psyops is the gender divide."},{"text":"I think Dems need to actually touch the grass at some point.

Liberalism is the ideology of the Bourgeoisie. They were a progressive force when it came to overthrowing the entrenched order, now *they* are the entrenched order. The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force. The class which has the means of material production at its disposal, has control at the same time over the means of mental production, so that thereby, generally speaking, the ideas of those who lack the means of mental production are subject to it. The ruling ideas are nothing more than the ideal expression of the dominant material relationships, the dominant material relationships grasped as ideas; hence of the relationships which make the one class the ruling one, therefore, the ideas of its dominance. The individuals composing the ruling class possess among other things consciousness, and therefore think. Insofar, therefore, as they rule as a class and determine the extent and compass of an epoch, it is self-evident that they do this in its whole range, hence among other things rule also as thinkers, as producers of ideas, and regulate the production and distribution of the ideas of their age: thus their ideas are the ruling ideas of the epoch. For instance, in an age and in a country where royal power, aristocracy, and bourgeoisie are contending for mastery and where, therefore, mastery is shared, the doctrine of the separation of powers proves to be the dominant idea and is expressed as an eternal law.","title":"Liberals Are Finally Admitting Bernie Is Right | After another devastating loss to Donald Trump, a few liberal pundits are begrudgingly admitting it  Bernie Sanders was right."},{"text":"Despite an alien invasion, I think I will still have to go to work the next day.
